The letters herein by Lincoln are so thoroughly characteristic of the man , and are in themselves so <<target>> self-explanatory , that it requires no comment to enable the reader fully to understand and appreciate them .::::completely
It will be observed that the philosophical admonitions in the letter to his brother , <<target>> , were written on the same sheet with the letter to his father .::::johnston
The promptness and decision with which Lincoln despatched the multitudinous affairs of his office during the most turbulent scenes of the <<target>> War are exemplified in his unequivocal order to the Attorney-General , indorsed on the back of the letter of Hon .::::civil

No man since Washington has become to Americans so <<target>> or so beloved a figure as Abraham Lincoln .::::familiar
He is to them the representative and typical American , the <<target>> who best embodies the political ideals of the nation .::::man
He is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of the people , that he remained through his whole career a man of the people , that his <<target>> desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and wishes of the people , that he never failed to trust in the people and to rely on their support .::::chief
Every native American knows his <<target>> and his speeches .::::life
His anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and the conversation <<target>> the whole nation as those of no other statesman have done .::::of
He belongs , however , not only to the United <<target>> , but to the whole of civilized mankind .::::states
Without him , the course of events not only in the Western hemisphere but in Europe also would have been different , for he was called to guide at the greatest crisis <<target>> its fate a State already mighty , and now far more mighty than in his days , and the guidance he gave has affected the march of events ever since .::::of
A life and a character such as his ought to be <<target>> to and comprehended by Europeans as well as by Americans .::::known
Among Europeans , it is especially Englishmen who ought to appreciate him and understand the significance of his life , for he came of an English stock , he spoke the English <<target>> , his action told upon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all British communities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation outside America itself .::::tongue
This collection of Lincoln 's speeches seeks to make him known by <<target>> words as readers of history know him by his deeds .::::his
In popularly-governed countries the great statesman is almost of necessity an orator , though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure either <<target>> his momentary power or of his permanent fame , for wisdom , courage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech .::::of
But whether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree , the <<target>> and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own words .::::character
This is particularly true of Lincoln , because he <<target>> not what may be called a professional orator .::::was
There have been famous orators whose speeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth of <<target>> they contain , with comparatively little regard to the circumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered .::::ideas
Lincoln is not <<target>> of these .::::one
His speeches need to be studied in close <<target>> to the occasions which called them forth .::::relation
They are not philosophical lucubrations <<target>> brilliant displays of rhetoric .::::or
They are a part <<target>> his life .::::of
They are the expression of his convictions , and derive no small part of their weight and dignity from the <<target>> that they deal with grave and urgent questions , and express the spirit in which he approached those questions .::::fact
Few great characters stand out so clearly revealed by their <<target>> , whether spoken or written , as he does .::::words
Accordingly Lincoln 's discourses are not like those of nearly <<target>> the men whose eloquence has won them fame .::::all
When we think of such men as Pericles , Demosthenes , Ã†schines , Cicero , Hortensius , Burke , Sheridan , Erskine , Canning , Webster , Gladstone , Bright , Massillon , Vergniaud , Castelar , we think of exuberance of <<target>> or of phrases , of a command of appropriate similes or metaphors , of the gifts of invention and of exposition , of imaginative flights , or outbursts of passion fit to stir and rouse an audience to like passion .::::ideas
Or if -- remembering that Lincoln was by profession a lawyer and practised until he became President of the United States -- we think of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator , we should expect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety , one dexterous in handling his case <<target>> such wise as to please and capture the judge or the jury whom he addresses , one skilled in those rhetorical devices and strokes of art which can be used , when need be , to engage the listener 's feelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue .::::in
Of all this kind of talent <<target>> was in Lincoln but little .::::there
He was not an artful pleader ; indeed , it was said of him that he could argue well only those <<target>> in the justice of which he personally believed , and was unable to make the worse appear the better reason .::::cases
For most of the qualities which the world admires in Cicero or <<target>> Burke we should look in vain in Lincoln 's speeches .::::in
They are not fine pieces of exquisite diction , fit to be <<target>> as school exercises or set before students as models of composition .::::declaimed
What , then , <<target>> their merits ?::::are
and why do they deserve <<target>> be valued and remembered ?::::to
How comes it that a man of first-rate powers was deficient in <<target>> appertaining to his own profession which men less remarkable have possessed ?::::qualities
To answer this question , let us first ask what were the preparation <<target>> training Abraham Lincoln had for oratory , whether political or forensic .::::and
Not even books wherewith to inform and <<target>> his mind were within his reach .::::train
No school , no university , no legal <<target>> had any part in training his powers .::::faculty
When he became a lawyer and a politician , the years most favourable to continuous <<target>> had already passed , and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty .::::study
He taught himself a little mathematics , but he could read no language save his own , <<target>> can have had only the faintest acquaintance with European history or with any branch of philosophy .::::and
The want of regular education was not made up for <<target>> the persons among whom his lot was cast .::::by
Till he was a grown man , he never moved in any society from which he could <<target>> those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored .::::learn
Even after he had gained some legal practice , there was for many years no one for him to mix with <<target>> the petty practitioners of a petty town , men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself .::::except
Schools gave him nothing , <<target>> society gave him nothing .::::and
But he had a powerful <<target>> and a resolute will .::::intellect
He made all that he <<target>> a part of himself .::::knew
He thought everything <<target>> for himself .::::out
He was not positive or opinionated , and he did not deny that at <<target>> moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course .::::certain
But though he could keep a policy in suspense , waiting <<target>> events to guide him , he did not waver .::::for
He paused and reconsidered , but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision <<target>> made , or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained .::::once
He took advice readily , and left many things to his <<target>> ; but he did not lean upon his advisers .::::ministers
That he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes , that his mind played freely round everything it touched , <<target>> know from the accounts of his talk , which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived .::::we
His humour , and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose , at the right moment , are qualities which Europe <<target>> distinctively American , but no great man of action in the nineteenth century , even in America , possessed them in the same measure .::::deems
Seldom has so acute a power of observation been <<target>> united to so abundant a power of sympathy .::::found
These remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches , yet <<target>> are not irrelevant , because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character .::::they
Let us , however , return to the speeches and to the letters , some of <<target>> , given in this volume , are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches .::::which
What are the distinctive merits <<target>> these speeches and letters ?::::of
There is less humour in them than his reputation <<target>> a humorist would have led us to expect .::::as
They are serious , <<target>> , practical .::::grave
We feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of <<target>> subject , or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness .::::the
He is trying to get right down to the very foundation of <<target>> matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are .::::the
So too , in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts , Lincoln 's bear a sort of likeness to Cromwell 's speeches , though Cromwell has far less <<target>> of utterance , and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain , true and weighty to himself .::::power
This difficulty makes the great Protector , though we can usually <<target>> what he is driving at , frequently confused and obscure .::::see
Lincoln , however , <<target>> always clear .::::is
Simplicity , directness and breadth are <<target>> notes of his thought .::::the
The American speakers of his generation , like most of those of the preceding generation , but unlike those of that earlier generation to which <<target>> Hamilton , John Adams , Marshall and Madison belonged , were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by-word in Europe .::::alexander
Even men of brilliant talent , such as Edward Everett , were by no <<target>> free from this straining after effect by highly-coloured phrases and theatrical effects .::::means
Such faults have to-day virtually vanished from the United States , largely from a change in <<target>> taste , to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may have contributed .::::public
In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant , especially in the West <<target>> South , where taste was less polished than in the older States .::::and
That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of <<target>> independence as well as of his greatness .::::his
There is no superfluous ornament in his <<target>> , nothing tawdry , nothing otiose .::::orations
For the most part , he addresses the reason of his hearers , and <<target>> them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them .::::credits
When he does appeal to emotion , he <<target>> it quietly , perhaps even solemnly .::::does
The note struck is <<target>> a high note .::::always
The impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of <<target>> , but from the sincerity of his own convictions .::::language
Sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker 's feeling , and when the time comes for <<target>> feeling to be directly expressed , it glows not with fitful flashes , but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul .::::the
The impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter <<target>> been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learnt by heart .::::has
It has also been stated , on good authority , that on his way in the railroad cars , to the dedication of the monument on the field of Gettysburg , he turned to a Pennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked , `` I suppose I shall be expected to say something this <<target>> ; lend me a pencil and a bit of paper , '' and that he thereupon jotted down the notes of a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all his utterances , so that some of its words and sentences have passed into the minds of all educated men everywhere .::::afternoon
That famous Gettysburg speech is the best example one could <<target>> of the characteristic quality of Lincoln 's eloquence .::::desire
It is a <<target>> speech .::::short
It is wonderfully <<target>> in expression .::::terse
It is quiet , so quiet that at the moment it did not make upon the audience , an audience wrought up by a long and highly-decorated harangue from one <<target>> the prominent orators of the day , an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to make as soon as it was read over America and Europe .::::of
There is in it not a touch of what we <<target>> rhetoric , or of any striving after effect .::::call
Alike in thought and in language it <<target>> simple , plain , direct .::::is
But it states certain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so forcible , that one feels as if those <<target>> could have been conveyed in no other words , and as if this deliverance of them were made for all time .::::truths
Words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who had meditated so long upon the primal facts of American history and popular <<target>> that the truths those facts taught him had become like the truths of mathematics in their clearness , their breadth , and their precision .::::government
The speeches on Slavery read strange to us now , when slavery as a living system has <<target>> dead for forty years , dead and buried hell deep under the detestation of mankind .::::been
It is hard for those whose memory does not go back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a terrible fact , but was defended -- defended by many otherwise good <<target>> , defended not only by pseudo-scientific anthropologists as being in the order of nature , but by ministers of the Gospel , out of the sacred Scriptures , as part of the ordinances of God .::::men
Lincoln 's position , the position of one who had to induce slave-owning fellow-citizens to listen to him and admit persuasion into their <<target>> and prejudiced minds , did not allow him to denounce it with horror , as we can all so easily do to-day .::::heated
He shows its innate evils <<target>> dangers with unanswerable force .::::and
The speech on the Dred Scott decision is a lucid , close and cogent piece of reasoning which , in its wide view of Constitutional issues , <<target>> reminds one of Webster , sometimes even of Burke , though it does not equal the former in weight nor the latter in splendour of diction .::::sometimes
Among the letters , perhaps the most impressive is that written to Mrs. Bixley , the mother <<target>> five sons who had died fighting for the Union in the armies of the North .::::of
It is short , and it deals with a <<target>> on which hundreds of letters are written daily .::::theme
But I do not know where the nobility of self-sacrifice for a great cause , and of the consolation which <<target>> thought of a sacrifice so made should bring , is set forth with such simple and pathetic beauty .::::the
Deep must be the fountains from which <<target>> issues so pure a stream .::::there
The career of Lincoln is often held up to ambitious young Americans as an example to show what <<target>> man may achieve by his native strength , with no advantages of birth or environment or education .::::a
In this there is nothing <<target>> , nothing fanciful .::::improper
The moral is one which may well be drawn , and in which <<target>> on whose early life Fortune has not smiled may find encouragement .::::those
But the example is , after all , no great encouragement <<target>> ordinary men , for Lincoln was an extraordinary man .::::to
He triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years <<target>> Nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers .::::because
Superficial observers who saw his homely aspect and plain manners , and noted that his fellow-townsmen , when asked why they so trusted <<target>> , answered that it was for his common-sense , failed to see that his common-sense was a part of his genius .::::him
What is common-sense but the power of seeing the fundamentals of any practical question , and of disengaging them from the accidental and <<target>> features that may overlie these fundamentals -- the power , to use a familiar expression , of getting down to bed rock ?::::transient
One part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what <<target>> average man will think and can be induced to do .::::the
This is what keeps the superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind , and this is perhaps why the name of `` common-sense '' is <<target>> , because the superior mind seems in its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general sense of the community .::::used
All men of high practical <<target>> have this power .::::capacity
It is the first <<target>> of success .::::condition
But in men who have received a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to embellish , for purposes of persuasion , or perhaps for their own gratification , the language in which they recommend <<target>> conclusions , or to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles , a tendency which may , unless carefully watched , carry them too high above the heads of the crowd .::::their
Lincoln , never having had such an education , <<target>> to the people as one of themselves .::::spoke
He seemed to be saying not only what each felt , <<target>> expressing the feeling just as each would have expressed it .::::but
In reality , he was quite as much above his neighbours in insight as was the polished orator <<target>> writer , but the plain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level .::::or
His strength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the thought <<target>> , in the large , simple , practical view which he took of the position .::::itself
And thus , to repeat what has been said already , the sterling merit of these speeches of his , that which made them effective when they were <<target>> and makes them worth reading to-day , is to be found in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the circumstances of the time .::::delivered
When he rose into higher air , when his words were clothed with stateliness and solemnity , it was the force of his conviction and the <<target>> that thrilled through his utterance , that printed the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts of the people .::::emotion
What is a <<target>> man ?::::great
Common speech , which after all must be our guide to the sense of the <<target>> which the world uses , gives this name to many sorts of men .::::terms
How far greatness lies in the power and range of the intellect , how far in the strength of the will , <<target>> far in elevation of view and aim and purpose , -- this is a question too large to be debated here .::::how
But of Abraham Lincoln it may be truly said <<target>> in his greatness all three elements were present .::::that
He had not the brilliance , either in thought or word or act , that dazzles , nor <<target>> restless activity that occasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the first order .::::the
He was a patient , thoughtful , melancholy man , whose intelligence , working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely , <<target>> capacious enough to embrace and vigorous enough to master the incomparably difficult facts and problems he was called to deal with .::::was
His executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes , but in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his plans , in the undismayed firmness <<target>> which he adhered to them in the face of popular clamour , of conflicting counsels from his advisers , sometimes , even , of what others deemed all but hopeless failure .::::with
These were the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the <<target>> through the heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it .::::republic
But the mainspring of his power , and the truest evidence of his greatness , lay in the nobility of his aims , in <<target>> fervour of his conviction , in the stainless rectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the people .::::the
Without these things neither the vigour of his intellect <<target>> the firmness of his will would have availed .::::nor
There is a vulgar saying that <<target>> great men are unscrupulous .::::all
Of him it may rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking <<target>> his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and purity of his character .::::and
Lincoln 's is one of the careers <<target>> refute this imputation on human nature .::::that
But such belong not to the family of <<target>> lion or the brood of the eagle .::::the
Towering genius disdains <<target>> beaten path .::::a
It seeks regions <<target>> unexplored .::::hitherto
It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon <<target>> monuments of fame erected to the memory of others .::::the
It denies that it is glory <<target>> to serve under any chief .::::enough
It scorns to tread in the footsteps <<target>> any predecessor , however illustrious .::::of
It thirsts and burns for distinction ; and , if possible , it will have <<target>> , whether at the expense of emancipating slaves , or enslaving free men .::::it
Is it unreasonable , then , to expect that some men , possessed of the loftiest genius , coupled <<target>> ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch , will at some time spring up among us ?::::with
Distinction will be his paramount object , and although he would as willingly , perhaps more so , acquire it by doing good as harm , yet that <<target>> being passed , and nothing left to be done in the way of building up , he would sit down boldly to the task of pulling down .::::opportunity
Here , then , is a probable case , highly dangerous , <<target>> such a one as could not well have existed heretofore .::::and
All honour to our Revolutionary ancestors , to <<target>> we are indebted for these institutions .::::whom
They will not <<target>> forgotten .::::be
In history we hope they will be read of , and <<target>> , so long as the Bible shall be read .::::recounted

Even then , they can not be so universally known , nor so <<target>> felt , as they were by the generation just gone to rest .::::vividly
At the close of that struggle , nearly every adult <<target>> had been a participator in some of its scenes .::::male
The consequence was , that of those scenes , in the form of a husband , a father , a son , or a brother , a living history was to be found in every family , -- a history bearing the indubitable testimonies to its own <<target>> in the limbs mangled , in the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related ; a history , too , that could be read and understood alike by all , the wise and the ignorant , the learned and the unlearned .::::authenticity
But those histories <<target>> gone .::::are
They can be read <<target>> more for ever .::::no
Dear Madam , Without apologising for being egotistical , I shall make the history of so <<target>> of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter .::::much
And , by the way , I now discover that in order to give a full and intelligible account of the <<target>> I have done and suffered since I saw you , I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before .::::things
It was , then , in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance , and who was a great friend of mine , being about to pay a visit to her father and <<target>> relatives residing in Kentucky , proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all convenient dispatch .::::other
I , of course , accepted the proposal , for you know I could not have done otherwise had I really been <<target>> to it ; but privately , between you and me , I was most confoundedly well pleased with the project .::::averse
I had seen the said sister some three years before , thought her intelligent and <<target>> , and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand-in-hand with her .::::agreeable
Time passed on , the lady took her journey , and <<target>> due time returned , sister in company , sure enough .::::in
This astonished me a little , for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing , but on reflection it occurred to me that she might have been <<target>> on by her married sister to come , without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her , and so I concluded that if no other objection presented itself , I would consent to waive this .::::prevailed
All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighbourhood -- for , be it <<target>> , I had not yet seen her , except about three years previous , as above mentioned .::::remembered
In a few days we had an interview , and , although I had <<target>> her before , she did not look as my imagination had pictured her .::::seen
I knew she was over-size , but she <<target>> appeared a fair match for Falstaff .::::now
I knew she was called an `` old maid , '' and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation , but now , when I beheld her , I could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother ; and this , not from withered features , -- for her skin was too full of fat to permit <<target>> its contracting into wrinkles -- but from her want of teeth , weather-beaten appearance in general , and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirty-five or forty years ; and , in short , I was not at all pleased with her .::::of
But what could <<target>> do ?::::i
I had told her sister that I would take her for better or for worse , and I made a point of honour and conscience in all things to stick to my word , especially if others had been induced to act on <<target>> , which in this case I had no doubt they had , for I was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her , and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain .::::it
`` Well , '' thought I , `` I have said it , and , be the consequences <<target>> they may , it shall not be my fault if I fail to do it . ''::::what
At once I determined to consider her my wife , and this done , all my powers of discovery <<target>> put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects .::::were
I tried to imagine her handsome , which , <<target>> for her unfortunate corpulency , was actually true .::::but
Exclusive of this , no woman that I <<target>> ever seen has a finer face .::::have
I also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person , and <<target>> this she was not inferior , as I could discover , to any with whom I had been acquainted .::::in
During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change my opinion of <<target>> her intellect or intention , but , on the contrary , confirmed it in both .::::either
All this while , although I was fixed `` firm as the surge-repelling rock '' in my <<target>> , I found I was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it .::::resolution
After my return home I saw nothing to <<target>> my opinion of her in any particular .::::change
She was the same , and so was I. I now spent my time in planning how I might get along in life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have <<target>> place , and how I might procrastinate the evil day for a time , which I really dreaded as much , perhaps more , than an Irishman does the halter .::::taken
After all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject , here I am , wholly , unexpectedly , completely out of the `` scrape , '' and I now want to know <<target>> you can guess how I got out of it -- out , clear , in every sense of the term -- no violation of word , honour , or conscience .::::if
I do n't believe you can guess , and <<target>> I might as well tell you at once .::::so
As the lawyer says , it was done in the manner following , to wit : After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honour do ( which , by the way , had brought me round into <<target>> last fall ) , I concluded I might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay , and so I mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct ; but , shocking to relate , she answered , No .::::the
At first I supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty , which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar <<target>> of the case , but on my renewal of the charge I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before .::::circumstances
I tried it again and again , but with the same <<target>> , or rather with the same want of success .::::success
I finally was forced to give it up , at <<target>> I very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance .::::which
I was mortified , it seemed to <<target>> , in a hundred different ways .::::me
My vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that I had so long been too stupid to discover her intentions , and at the same time never doubting that I <<target>> them perfectly ; and also that she , whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have , had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness .::::understood
And , to cap the whole , I then for the first time <<target>> to suspect that I was really a little in love with her .::::began

We repeat , then , that a tariff sufficient for revenue , or a direct tax , must soon <<target>> resorted to ; and , indeed , we believe this alternative is now denied by no one .::::be
But which system <<target>> be adopted ?::::shall
Some of our opponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for revenue , but even <<target>> will not in practice vote for such a tariff ; while others boldly advocate direct taxation .::::they
Inasmuch , therefore , as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation , and all the rest -- or so nearly all as to make exceptions <<target>> -- refuse to adopt the tariff , we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation .::::needless
Indeed , we believe they are only delaying an open avowal of the <<target>> till they can assure themselves that the people will tolerate it .::::system
Let us , then , <<target>> compare the two systems .::::briefly
The tariff is the cheaper system , because the duties , being collected in large parcels , at a few commercial points , will require comparatively few officers in their collection ; while <<target>> the direct tax system the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors , going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts , devouring every blade of grass and other green thing .::::by
And , again , by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers <<target>> foreign goods , and those chiefly the luxuries and not the necessaries of life .::::of
By this system , the man who contents himself to live <<target>> the products of his own country pays nothing at all .::::upon
And surely that country is extensive enough , and its products abundant and <<target>> enough , to answer all the real wants of its people .::::varied
In short , by this system the burden of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few , <<target>> the substantial and labouring many , who live at home and upon home products , go entirely free .::::while
With these views , we leave it to be determined whether <<target>> or our opponents are more truly democratic on the subject .::::we

Probably in a popular vote throughout the nation nine-tenths of the voters in the free States , and at least one-half in the border States , if they could express their <<target>> freely , would vote NO on such an issue ; and it is safe to say that two-thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it .::::sentiments

Now , if slavery is right , or even negative , <<target>> has a right to treat it in this trifling manner .::::he

In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in Illinois one year after its admission , or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population ; or , to state it in <<target>> way , if Illinois was a slave State in 1820 , so were New York and New Jersey much greater slave States from having had greater numbers , slavery having been established there in very early times .::::another

The illness of the good old man was long and lingering , and it became at last a matter <<target>> intense interest to those concerned whether the new appointment should be made by a conservative or liberal government .::::of
It was pretty well understood that the outgoing premier had made his selection and that if the question rested <<target>> him , the mitre would descend on the head of Archdeacon Grantly , the old bishop 's son .::::with

The effort was a salutary one , and <<target>> question was answered in a moment .::::the
The proud , wishful , worldly man sank on his knees by the bedside and , taking <<target>> bishop 's hand within his own , prayed eagerly that his sins might be forgiven him .::::the
His face was still buried in the clothes when the door of <<target>> bedroom opened noiselessly and Mr. Harding entered with a velvet step .::::the
Mr. Harding 's attendance at that bedside had been nearly as constant as that of the archdeacon , <<target>> his ingress and egress was as much a matter of course as that of his son-in-law .::::and

Mr. Harding explained that news to this effect had come down by electric telegraph , <<target>> that the tidings had been left at the palace door by Mr. Chadwick .::::and

Dr. Proudie was not the man to allow anything to <<target>> omitted that might be becoming to his new dignity .::::be
He understood well the value of forms , and knew that the due observance of rank <<target>> not be maintained unless the exterior trappings belonging to it were held in proper esteem .::::could

Some few years since , even within the memory of many who are not yet willing <<target>> call themselves old , a liberal clergyman was a person not frequently to be met .::::to
Sydney Smith was such and was looked on as little better than an infidel ; a few others also <<target>> be named , but they were _rarae aves_ and were regarded with doubt and distrust by their brethren .::::might
No man was so surely a Tory as a country rector -- <<target>> were the powers that be so cherished as at Oxford .::::nowhere
When , however , Dr. Whately was made an archbishop , and Dr. Hampden some years afterwards regius professor , many wise divines saw that a change <<target>> taking place in men 's minds , and that more liberal ideas would henceforward be suitable to the priests as well as to the laity .::::was
Clergymen began to be heard of who had ceased to anathematize papists <<target>> the one hand , or vilify dissenters on the other .::::on
It appeared clear that High Church principles , as they are called , were no longer to be surest claims to promotion with at any rate one section of <<target>> , and Dr. Proudie was one among those who early in life adapted himself to the views held by the Whigs on most theological and religious subjects .::::statesmen
He was made one of a commission who went over to Ireland to arrange matters preparative to the working of the national board ; he became honorary secretary <<target>> another commission nominated to inquire into the revenues of cathedral chapters ; he had had something to do with both the _regium donum_ and the Maynooth grant .::::to
It must not on this account be taken as proved that Dr. Proudie was a man of great mental <<target>> , or even of much capacity for business , for such qualities had not been required in him .::::powers
In the arrangement of those church reforms with which he was connected , the ideas and original conception of the work to be done were <<target>> furnished by the liberal statesmen of the day , and the labour of the details was borne by officials of a lower rank .::::generally
If he did not do much active good , he never did any harm ; he was amenable to those who were really in <<target>> and , at the sittings of the various boards to which he belonged , maintained a kind of dignity which had its value .::::authority
He was certainly possessed of sufficient tact to answer the purpose for which he was required without making himself troublesome ; but it must not therefore be surmised <<target>> he doubted his own power , or failed to believe that he could himself take a high part in high affairs when his own turn came .::::that
He was biding his time , and patiently looking forward to the days when he himself would sit authoritative at some board , and talk <<target>> direct , and rule the roost , while lesser stars sat round and obeyed , as he had so well accustomed himself to do .::::and
His reward and his <<target>> had now come .::::time
He was selected for the vacant bishopric and , on the next vacancy which might occur in any diocese , would take his place <<target>> the House of Lords , prepared to give not a silent vote in all matters concerning the weal of the church establishment .::::in
Toleration was to be the basis on which he was to fight his battles , and in the honest courage of his <<target>> he thought no evil would come to him in encountering even such foes as his brethren of Exeter and Oxford .::::heart
Dr. Proudie was an ambitious man , and before he was well consecrated Bishop of Barchester , he had begun <<target>> look up to archiepiscopal splendour , and the glories of Lambeth , or at any rate of Bishopsthorpe .::::to
London should still be his ground : a comfortable mansion in a provincial <<target>> might be well enough for the dead months of the year .::::city
Indeed , Dr. Proudie had always felt it necessary to his position to retire from London when other great and fashionable people did so ; but London should <<target>> be his fixed residence , and it was in London that he resolved to exercise that hospitality so peculiarly recommended to all bishops by St. Paul .::::still
How otherwise could he keep <<target>> before the world ?::::himself
This resolution was no doubt a salutary one as regarded the world at large , but <<target>> not likely to make him popular either with the clergy or people of Barchester .::::was
Dr. Grantly had always lived there -- in truth , it <<target>> hard for a bishop to be popular after Dr. Grantly .::::was
His income had averaged Â£9,000 a year ; his <<target>> was to be rigidly limited to Â£5,000 .::::successor
He had but one child on whom to spend <<target>> money ; Dr. Proudie had seven or eight .::::his
Dr. Grantly had certainly kept his carriage as became a bishop , but his carriage , horses , <<target>> coachman , though they did very well for Barchester , would have been almost ridiculous at Westminster .::::and
From all this it was likely to result that Dr. Proudie would not spend much money at Barchester , <<target>> his predecessor had dealt with the tradesmen of the city in a manner very much to their satisfaction .::::whereas
He is somewhat below middle height , being about five feet four ; but he makes up <<target>> the inches which he wants by the dignity with which he carries those which he has .::::for
It is no fault of his own if he has not <<target>> commanding eye , for he studies hard to assume it .::::a
His features are well formed , though perhaps the sharpness of his nose may <<target>> to his face in the eyes of some people an air of insignificance .::::give
If so , it is greatly redeemed by his mouth <<target>> chin , of which he is justly proud .::::and
Dr. Proudie may well be said to have been a fortunate man , for he was not born <<target>> wealth , and he is now Bishop of Barchester ; nevertheless , he has his cares .::::to
He has a large family , of whom the three eldest are daughters , now <<target>> grown up and fit for fashionable life ; -- and he has a wife .::::all
It is not my intention to breathe a word against the character of Mrs. Proudie , but still <<target>> can not think that with all her virtues she adds much to her husband 's happiness .::::i

The archdeacon 's wife , in her happy home at Plumstead , knows how to assume <<target>> full privileges of her rank and express her own mind in becoming tone and place .::::the
But Mrs. Grantly 's sway , if sway <<target>> has , is easy and beneficent .::::she
She never shames her husband ; before the world she is a pattern of obedience ; her voice is never loud , nor her looks sharp : <<target>> she values power , and has not unsuccessfully striven to acquire it ; but she knows what should be the limits of a woman 's rule .::::doubtless
This lady is habitually authoritative to all , <<target>> to her poor husband she is despotic .::::but
Successful as has been his career in the eyes of the world , it <<target>> seem that in the eyes of his wife he is never right .::::would
All hope of defending himself has long passed from him ; indeed he rarely even attempts self-justification , <<target>> is aware that submission produces the nearest approach to peace which his own house can ever attain .::::and
Mrs. Proudie has not been able to sit at the boards and committees to which her husband has been called by <<target>> State , nor , as he often reflects , can she make her voice heard in the House of Lords .::::the
He has never whispered a word on the subject to living <<target>> , but he has already made his fixed resolve .::::ears

Dogs have turned against their masters , and even Neapolitans <<target>> their rulers , when oppression has been too severe .::::against
And Dr. Proudie feels within himself that if the cord be <<target>> too tight , he also can muster courage and resist .::::drawn
The state of vassalage in which our bishop has been kept by his wife has not tended to exalt his character in the eyes of his <<target>> , who assume in addressing their father too much of that authority which is not properly belonging , at any rate , to them .::::daughters
They think somewhat too much of their grand-uncles , who have <<target>> hitherto returned the compliment by thinking much of them .::::not
But now that their father is a bishop , it <<target>> probable that family ties will be drawn closer .::::is
Considering their connexion with the church , they entertain but few prejudices against the pleasures of the world , and have certainly not distressed their <<target>> , as too many English girls have lately done , by any enthusiastic wish to devote themselves to the seclusion of a Protestant nunnery .::::parents
Dr. Proudie 's sons <<target>> still at school .::::are
One other marked peculiarity in the character of <<target>> bishop 's wife must be mentioned .::::the
Dissipation and low dresses during the week are , under her control , atoned for by three services , <<target>> evening sermon read by herself , and a perfect abstinence from any cheering employment on the Sunday .::::an
Woe betide the recreant housemaid who is found to have been listening to the honey of <<target>> sweetheart in the Regent 's park instead of the soul-stirring evening discourse of Mr. Slope .::::a
Not only is she sent adrift , but she is so sent <<target>> a character which leaves her little hope of a decent place .::::with
Woe betide the six-foot hero who escorts Mrs. Proudie to her pew in red plush breeches , if he <<target>> away to the neighbouring beer-shop , instead of falling into the back seat appropriated to his use .::::slips
Mrs. Proudie has the eyes <<target>> Argus for such offenders .::::of
Occasional drunkenness in the week may be overlooked , for six feet on low wages are hardly to be procured if the morals are <<target>> kept at a high pitch , but not even for grandeur or economy will Mrs. Proudie forgive a desecration of the Sabbath .::::always
In such matters Mrs. Proudie allows herself to be <<target>> guided by that eloquent preacher , the Rev .::::often
Mr. Slope , and as Dr. Proudie is guided by his wife , it necessarily follows that the eminent <<target>> we have named has obtained a good deal of control over Dr. Proudie in matters concerning religion .::::man
Mr. Slope 's only preferment has hitherto been that of reader and preacher in a London district church ; and on the consecration of <<target>> friend the new bishop , he readily gave this up to undertake the onerous but congenial duties of domestic chaplain to his lordship .::::his
Mr. Slope , however , on his first introduction must not <<target>> brought before the public at the tail of a chapter .::::be
Mr. Slope 's parentage I am <<target>> able to say much .::::not
I have heard it asserted that he is lineally descended from that eminent physician who assisted at the birth of Mr. T. Shandy , and that in <<target>> years he added an `` e '' to his name , for the sake of euphony , as other great men have done before him .::::early
If this be so , I presume he was christened Obadiah , for that is <<target>> name , in commemoration of the conflict in which his ancestor so distinguished himself .::::his
All my researches on the subject have , however , failed in enabling <<target>> to fix the date on which the family changed its religion .::::me
He had been a sizar at Cambridge , and had there conducted himself at any rate successfully , <<target>> in due process of time he was an M.A. , having university pupils under his care .::::for
From thence he was transferred to London , and became preacher at <<target>> new district church built on the confines of Baker Street .::::a
He was in this position when congenial ideas on religious subjects recommended him <<target>> Mrs. Proudie , and the intercourse had become close and confidential .::::to
Having been thus familiarly thrown among the Misses Proudie , it was no <<target>> than natural that some softer feeling than friendship should be engendered .::::more
In truth , Mr. Slope , having made a declaration of affection , afterwards withdrew it on finding that the doctor had no immediate worldly funds with which to endow his <<target>> , and it may easily be conceived that Miss Proudie , after such an announcement on his part , was not readily disposed to receive any further show of affection .::::child
Bishops , even though they be poor , can provide for clerical children , <<target>> Mr. Slope began to regret that he had not been more disinterested .::::and
He no sooner heard the tidings of the doctor 's elevation than he recommenced his <<target>> , not violently , indeed , but respectfully , and at a distance .::::siege
Olivia Proudie , however , was a girl of spirit : she had the blood of two peers in her veins , and better still she had another <<target>> on her books , so Mr. Slope sighed in vain , and the pair soon found it convenient to establish a mutual bond of inveterate hatred .::::lover
It may be thought singular that Mrs. Proudie 's friendship for the young clergyman should remain firm after <<target>> an affair , but , to tell the truth , she had known nothing of it .::::such
Though very fond of Mr. Slope herself , she had never conceived the idea that either of her daughters would <<target>> so , and remembering their high birth and social advantages , expected for them matches of a different sort .::::become
Neither the gentleman nor the lady <<target>> it necessary to enlighten her .::::found
Olivia 's two sisters had each known of the affair , as had all the servants , as had all <<target>> people living in the adjoining houses on either side , but Mrs. Proudie had been kept in the dark .::::the
Mr. Slope soon comforted himself with the reflexion that , as he had been selected as chaplain to the bishop , it would probably be in his power to get <<target>> good things in the bishop 's gift without troubling himself with the bishop 's daughter , and he found himself able to endure the pangs of rejected love .::::the
As he sat himself down in the railway carriage , confronting the bishop and Mrs. Proudie as they started on <<target>> first journey to Barchester , he began to form in his own mind a plan of his future life .::::their
He knew well his patron 's strong points , <<target>> he knew the weak ones as well .::::but
He understood correctly enough to what attempts the new bishop 's high spirit would soar , and he rightly <<target>> that public life would better suit the great man 's taste than the small details of diocesan duty .::::guessed
Such was his resolve , and to give Mr. Slope his due , <<target>> had both courage and spirit to bear him out in his resolution .::::he
He knew that he should have a hard battle to fight , for the power and patronage of the see <<target>> be equally coveted by another great mind -- Mrs. Proudie would also choose to be Bishop of Barchester .::::would
Mr. Slope , however , flattered himself <<target>> he could outmanoeuvre the lady .::::that
She must live much in London , while <<target>> would always be on the spot .::::he
She would necessarily remain ignorant of much , while <<target>> would know everything belonging to the diocese .::::he
At first , doubtless , he must flatter and cajole , perhaps yield <<target>> some things , but he did not doubt of ultimate triumph .::::in
If all other means failed , he could join the bishop against his wife , inspire courage into the <<target>> man , lay an axe to the root of the woman 's power , and emancipate the husband .::::unhappy
He is possessed of more than average <<target>> , and is of good courage .::::abilities
Though he can stoop to fawn , and stoop low indeed , if need be , he has still <<target>> him the power to assume the tyrant ; -- and with the power he has certainly the wish .::::within
He is gifted with a certain kind of pulpit eloquence , not likely <<target>> to be persuasive with men , but powerful with the softer sex .::::indeed
In his sermons he deals greatly in denunciations , excites the minds of his weaker hearers with a not unpleasant terror , and leaves an impression on their <<target>> that all mankind are in a perilous state , and all womankind , too , except those who attend regularly to the evening lectures in Baker Street .::::minds
His looks and tones are extremely severe , so much so that one can not but fancy <<target>> he regards the greater part of the world as being infinitely too bad for his care .::::that
As he walks through the streets his very face denotes his horror of the world 's <<target>> , and there is always an anathema lurking in the corner of his eye .::::wickedness
With Wesleyan-Methodists he has something in common , but his <<target>> trembles in agony at the iniquities of the Puseyites .::::soul
His aversion is carried to things <<target>> as well as inward .::::outward
Sunday , however , is a word which never pollutes <<target>> mouth -- it is always `` the Sabbath . ''::::his
The `` desecration of the Sabbath , '' as he delights to call it , is to him meat <<target>> drink : he thrives upon that as policemen do on the general evil habits of the community .::::and
It is the loved subject of all his evening discourses , the source of <<target>> his eloquence , the secret of all his power over the female heart .::::all
To him the revelation of God appears only <<target>> that one law given for Jewish observance .::::in
To him the New Testament is comparatively of little moment , for from it can he draw no fresh authority for <<target>> dominion which he loves to exercise over at least a seventh part of man 's allotted time here below .::::that
His feet and hands are large , as has ever been the case with all his family , but he has <<target>> broad chest and wide shoulders to carry off these excrescences , and on the whole his figure is good .::::a
His countenance , however , <<target>> not specially prepossessing .::::is
His hair is lank and of <<target>> dull pale reddish hue .::::a
It is always formed into three straight , lumpy masses , each brushed with admirable precision and cemented with much grease ; <<target>> of them adhere closely to the sides of his face , and the other lies at right angles above them .::::two
He wears no whiskers , <<target>> is always punctiliously shaven .::::and
His face is nearly of the same colour as his hair , though perhaps a little redder : <<target>> is not unlike beef -- beef , however , one would say , of a bad quality .::::it
His forehead is capacious and high , <<target>> square and heavy and unpleasantly shining .::::but
His mouth is large , though his lips are thin and bloodless ; <<target>> his big , prominent , pale-brown eyes inspire anything but confidence .::::and
His nose , however , is his redeeming feature : it is pronounced , straight and well-formed ; though I myself should have liked it <<target>> did it not possess a somewhat spongy , porous appearance , as though it had been cleverly formed out of a red-coloured cork .::::better
I never could endure to <<target>> hands with Mr. Slope .::::shake
A cold , clammy perspiration always exudes from him , the small drops are ever <<target>> be seen standing on his brow , and his friendly grasp is unpleasant .::::to
Such is Mr. Slope -- such is the man who has suddenly fallen into the midst of Barchester Close , <<target>> is destined there to assume the station which has heretofore been filled by the son of the late bishop .::::and
But not as a mere associate for these does Mr. Slope <<target>> down to Barchester with the bishop and his wife .::::travel
He intends to be , if not their <<target>> , at least the chief among them .::::master
He intends to lead and to have followers ; he intends to hold the purse-strings of <<target>> diocese and draw round him an obedient herd of his poor and hungry brethren .::::the
And here we can hardly fail to draw a comparison between the archdeacon and our new private chaplain , and <<target>> the manifold faults of the former , one can hardly fail to make it much to his advantage .::::despite
Both men are eager , much too eager , <<target>> support and increase the power of their order .::::to
Both are anxious that the world should be priest-governed , though <<target>> have probably never confessed so much , even to themselves .::::they
Both begrudge any other kind of <<target>> held by man over man .::::dominion
Dr. Grantly , if he admits the Queen 's supremacy in things spiritual , only admits it as being due to the quasi-priesthood conveyed <<target>> the consecrating qualities of her coronation , and he regards things temporal as being by their nature subject to those which are spiritual .::::in
Mr. Slope 's ideas of sacerdotal rule <<target>> of quite a different class .::::are
Let him be <<target>> who can .::::supreme
The temporal king , judge , or <<target>> can work but on the body .::::gaoler
The spiritual master , if he have the necessary gifts and <<target>> duly use them , has a wider field of empire .::::can
He works upon <<target>> soul .::::the
If he can make himself be believed , he <<target>> be all powerful over those who listen .::::can
If he be careful to meddle with none who are too strong in <<target>> , or too weak in flesh , he may indeed be supreme .::::intellect
And such was the <<target>> of Mr. Slope .::::ambition
Dr. Grantly interfered very little with the worldly doings of <<target>> who were in any way subject to him .::::those
I do not mean to say that he omitted to notice misconduct among his clergy , immorality in his parish , <<target>> omissions in his family , but he was not anxious to do so where the necessity could be avoided .::::or
He was not troubled with a propensity to be curious , and as long as those around him were tainted with no heretical leaning towards dissent , as long as they <<target>> and freely admitted the efficacy of Mother Church , he was willing that that mother should be merciful and affectionate , prone to indulgence , and unwilling to chastise .::::fully
He himself enjoyed the good things of this world and <<target>> to let it be known that he did so .::::liked
He cordially despised any brother rector who thought harm of dinner-parties , or dreaded the dangers <<target>> a moderate claret-jug ; consequently , dinner-parties and claret-jugs were common in the diocese .::::of
He liked to give laws and to be obeyed in them implicitly , but he endeavoured that <<target>> ordinances should be within the compass of the man and not unpalatable to the gentleman .::::his
He had ruled among his clerical neighbours now for sundry years , and as he had maintained <<target>> power without becoming unpopular , it may be presumed that he had exercised some wisdom .::::his
He conceives it to be his duty to know all the <<target>> doings and desires of the flock entrusted to his care .::::private
From the poorer classes he exacts an unconditional obedience to set rules of conduct , and if disobeyed he has recourse , like his great ancestor , to the fulminations of an Ernulfus : `` Thou shalt be damned in <<target>> going in and in thy coming out -- in thy eating and thy drinking , '' & c. & c. & c. With the rich , experience has already taught him that a different line of action is necessary .::::thy
Men in the upper walks of life do not mind being cursed , and the <<target>> , presuming that it be done in delicate phrase , rather like it .::::women
But he has not , therefore , given <<target>> so important a portion of believing Christians .::::up
With the men , indeed , he is generally at variance ; they are hardened sinners , on whom the voice of the priestly charmer too often falls in <<target>> ; but with the ladies , old and young , firm and frail , devout and dissipated , he is , as he conceives , all powerful .::::vain
He can reprove faults with so much flattery and utter censure in so caressing a manner that the <<target>> heart , if it glow with a spark of Low Church susceptibility , can not withstand him .::::female
In many houses he is thus an admired guest : the husbands , for their wives ' sake , <<target>> fain to admit him ; and when once admitted it is not easy to shake him off .::::are
He has , however , a pawing , greasy way with him , which does not endear him to those who do not value him for their souls ' <<target>> , and he is not a man to make himself at once popular in a large circle such as is now likely to surround him at Barchester .::::sake
Mr. Harding himself , when he heard how the matter had been settled , without troubling himself much on <<target>> subject , considered it as certain that he would go back to his pleasant house and garden .::::the
And though there would be much that was melancholy , nay , almost heartrending , <<target>> such a return , he still was glad that it was to be so .::::in
His daughter might probably be persuaded <<target>> return there with him .::::to
She had , indeed , all but promised to do so , though she still entertained an idea that that greatest of mortals , that important <<target>> of humanity , that little god upon earth , Johnny Bold her baby , ought to have a house of his own over his head .::::atom
Such being the state of Mr. Harding 's mind in the matter , he did <<target>> feel any peculiar personal interest in the appointment of Dr. Proudie to the bishopric .::::not
He , as well as others at Barchester , regretted that a man should be sent among them who , they were aware , was not of their way of thinking ; <<target>> Mr. Harding himself was not a bigoted man on points of church doctrine , and he was quite prepared to welcome Dr. Proudie to Barchester in a graceful and becoming manner .::::but
He had nothing to seek and nothing to fear ; he felt that it behoved him to be <<target>> good terms with his bishop , and he did not anticipate any obstacle that would prevent it .::::on
In such a frame of mind he proceeded to pay his respects at the <<target>> the second day after the arrival of the bishop and his chaplain .::::palace
But he did <<target>> go alone .::::not
In the affair of the consecration Dr. Grantly had been introduced <<target>> the bishop , and Mr. Harding had also been there .::::to
He had , however , kept himself in the background , and he <<target>> now to be presented to the great man for the first time .::::was
The archdeacon 's feelings were <<target>> a much stronger nature .::::of
He was not exactly the man to overlook his own slighted <<target>> , or to forgive the preference shown to another .::::claims
Dr. Proudie was playing Venus to his Juno , and he was prepared to wage an internecine war <<target>> the owner of the wished-for apple , and all his satellites , private chaplains , and others .::::against
Nevertheless , it behoved him also to conduct himself towards the intruder as an old archdeacon should conduct himself to an incoming bishop ; and though he was well aware of all Dr. Proudie 's abominable opinions as <<target>> dissenters , church reform , the hebdomadal council , and such like ; though he disliked the man , and hated the doctrines , still he was prepared to show respect to the station of the bishop .::::regarded
So he and Mr. Harding <<target>> together at the palace .::::called
His lordship was at home , and the two visitors were shown through the <<target>> hall into the well-known room where the good old bishop used to sit .::::accustomed
Nevertheless they at once felt <<target>> they were strangers there .::::that
The furniture was for the most part the <<target>> , yet the place had been metamorphosed .::::same
A new sofa had been introduced , a horrid chintz affair , most unprelatical and almost irreligious ; such a <<target>> as never yet stood in the study of any decent High Church clergyman of the Church of England .::::sofa
The old curtains had <<target>> given way .::::also
They had , to be sure , become dingy , and that which had <<target>> originally a rich and goodly ruby had degenerated into a reddish brown .::::been
Our friends found Dr. Proudie sitting on the old bishop 's chair , looking very nice in his new apron ; they found , too , Mr. Slope standing on the hearth-rug , persuasive and eager , <<target>> as the archdeacon used to stand ; but on the sofa they also found Mrs. Proudie , an innovation for which a precedent might in vain be sought in all the annals of the Barchester bishopric !::::just
There she was , however , and they <<target>> only make the best of her .::::could
The introductions were gone <<target>> in much form .::::through
The archdeacon shook hands with the bishop , and named Mr. Harding , who received <<target>> an amount of greeting as was due from a bishop to a precentor .::::such
After this Mr. <<target>> presented himself .::::slope
The bishop , it is true , did mention his name , and so did Mrs. Proudie too , <<target>> a louder tone , but Mr. Slope took upon himself the chief burden of his own introduction .::::in
He had great pleasure in making himself acquainted with Dr. Grantly ; he had heard much of the archdeacon 's good works in that part of the <<target>> in which his duties as archdeacon had been exercised ( thus purposely ignoring the archdeacon 's hitherto unlimited dominion over the diocese at large ) .::::diocese
He was aware that his lordship depended greatly on the assistance which Dr. <<target>> would be able to give him in that portion of his diocese .::::grantly
He then thrust out his hand and , grasping <<target>> of his new foe , bedewed it unmercifully .::::that
Dr. Grantly in return bowed , looked stiff , contracted <<target>> eyebrows , and wiped his hand with his pocket-handkerchief .::::his
Nothing abashed , Mr. Slope then noticed the precentor <<target>> descended to the grade of the lower clergy .::::and
He gave him a squeeze of the hand , damp indeed , but affectionate , and was very glad to <<target>> the acquaintance of Mr. -- oh yes , Mr. Harding ; he had not exactly caught the name .::::make
Mr. Harding confessed that such was <<target>> humble sphere of his work .::::the
Mr. Harding acknowledged the diminutive <<target>> of St. Cuthbert 's .::::incumbency
There were four persons there , each of whom considered himself the most important personage in the diocese -- himself , indeed , or herself , <<target>> Mrs. Proudie was one of them -- and with such a difference of opinion it was not probable that they would get on pleasantly together .::::as
The bishop himself actually wore the visible apron , and trusted mainly to that -- <<target>> that and his title , both being facts which could not be overlooked .::::to
The archdeacon knew his subject and really understood the business of bishoping , <<target>> the others did not , and this was his strong ground .::::which
Mrs. Proudie had her sex to back her , and her habit of command , <<target>> was nothing daunted by the high tone of Dr. Grantly 's face and figure .::::and
Mr. Slope had only himself and his own courage and tact to depend on , but he nevertheless was perfectly self-assured , and did not doubt <<target>> that he should soon get the better of weak men who trusted so much to externals , as both bishop and archdeacon appeared to do .::::but
`` Do you reside <<target>> Barchester , Dr .::::in
asked the lady with <<target>> sweetest smile .::::her
Dr. Grantly explained that he lived in his own parish of <<target>> Episcopi , a few miles out of the city .::::plumstead
She would take the earliest opportunity , after the arrival of her horses at Barchester ; their horses were at present in London ; <<target>> horses were not immediately coming down , as the bishop would be obliged , in a few days , to return to town .::::their
The bishop had also to prepare a scheme for the `` Manufacturing Towns Morning and Evening Sunday School Society , '' of which he was a patron , or president , or director , and therefore the horses would <<target>> come down to Barchester at present ; but whenever the horses did come down , she would take the earliest opportunity of calling at Plumstead Episcopi , providing the distance was not too great for country visiting .::::not
The archdeacon made his fifth bow -- he had made one at each mention of the horses -- and <<target>> that Mrs. Grantly would do herself the honour of calling at the palace on an early day .::::promised
Mrs. Proudie declared that she would be delighted : she had n't liked to ask , not being quite <<target>> whether Mrs. Grantly had horses ; besides , the distance might have been , & c. & c .::::sure
Dr. Grantly again bowed <<target>> said nothing .::::but
He could have bought every individual possession of the whole family of the Proudies and have restored them as a gift , without much feeling the loss ; and had kept a separate pair of horses for the exclusive use of his wife since the <<target>> of his marriage , whereas Mrs. Proudie had been hitherto jobbed about the streets of London at so much a month , during the season , and at other times had managed to walk , or hire a smart fly from the livery stables .::::day
`` Are the arrangements with reference to the Sabbath-day <<target>> generally pretty good in your archdeaconry ? ''::::schools
repeated the archdeacon with <<target>> affectation of surprise .::::an
`` Upon my word , I ca n't tell ; <<target>> depends mainly on the parson 's wife and daughters .::::it
There is none <<target>> Plumstead . ''::::at
This was almost a fib on the part of the <<target>> , for Mrs. Grantly has a very nice school .::::archdeacon
To be sure it is not a Sunday-school exclusively , and is not so designated , but that exemplary lady always attends there for an hour before church , and hears the children say their catechism , and sees that they are clean and tidy for church , with their hands washed and their shoes tied ; <<target>> Grisel and Florinda , her daughters , carry thither a basket of large buns , baked on the Saturday afternoon , and distribute them to all the children not especially under disgrace , which buns are carried home after church with considerable content , and eaten hot at tea , being then split and toasted .::::and
The children of Plumstead would indeed open their eyes if they heard <<target>> venerated pastor declare that there was no Sunday-school in his parish .::::their
Mr. Slope merely opened his wide eyes <<target>> and slightly shrugged his shoulders .::::wider
He was not , however , prepared <<target>> give up his darling project .::::to
`` I fear there is a great deal <<target>> Sabbath travelling here , '' said he .::::of
`` On looking at the 'Bradshaw , ' I see that <<target>> are three trains in and three out every Sabbath .::::there
Could nothing be done to induce <<target>> company to withdraw them ?::::the
Do n't you think , Dr. Grantly , that <<target>> little energy might diminish the evil ? ''::::a
`` Not being a director , <<target>> really ca n't say .::::i
But if you can withdraw the passengers , the company I <<target>> say will withdraw the trains , '' said the doctor .::::dare
`` It 's merely a <<target>> of dividends . ''::::question
`` But surely , Dr. Grantly , '' said the <<target>> ; `` surely we should look at it differently .::::lady
You and I , for instance , in our position : surely we <<target>> do all that we can to control so grievous a sin .::::should

Mr. Harding thought that all porters and stokers , guards , brakesmen , and pointsmen ought <<target>> have an opportunity of going to church , and he hoped that they all had .::::to

Surely that will not secure such an observance of the Sabbath as we <<target>> taught to conceive is not only expedient but indispensable ; surely -- ''::::are
Come what come might , Dr. Grantly was not to be forced into a dissertation on a point of doctrine with Mrs. Proudie , nor yet with Mr. Slope , so <<target>> much ceremony he turned his back upon the sofa and began to hope that Dr. Proudie had found that the palace repairs had been such as to meet his wishes .::::without
`` Yes , yes , '' said his lordship ; upon the whole he thought so -- upon the whole , he did n't know that there was much ground for complaint ; the <<target>> , perhaps , might have -- but his double , Mr. Slope , who had sidled over to the bishop 's chair , would not allow his lordship to finish his ambiguous speech .::::architect
`` There is one point I would <<target>> to mention , Mr. Archdeacon .::::like
His lordship asked me to step through the premises , and I <<target>> that the stalls in the second stable are not perfect . ''::::see
`` Why -- there 's standing there for <<target>> dozen horses , '' said the archdeacon .::::a
`` Perhaps so , '' said the other ; `` indeed , I 've no <<target>> of it ; but visitors , you know , often require so much accommodation .::::doubt
There are so many of the bishop 's <<target>> who always bring their own horses . ''::::relatives
Dr. Grantly promised that due provision for the relatives ' horses should be made , <<target>> far at least as the extent of the original stable building would allow .::::as
He would himself communicate <<target>> the architect .::::with
`` And the coach-house , Dr. Grantly , '' continued Mr. Slope ; `` there is really hardly room for <<target>> second carriage in the large coach-house , and the smaller one , of course , holds only one . ''::::a
`` And the gas , '' chimed in the lady ; `` there is no <<target>> through the house , none whatever , but in the kitchen and passages .::::gas
Surely the palace should have been fitted through with <<target>> for gas , and hot water too .::::pipes
There is no hot water laid on anywhere above the ground-floor ; surely there should be the means <<target>> getting hot water in the bedrooms without having it brought in jugs from the kitchen . ''::::of
The bishop had a decided opinion that <<target>> should be pipes for hot water .::::there
Hot water was very essential for <<target>> comfort of the palace .::::the
It was , indeed , a requisite <<target>> any decent gentleman 's house .::::in
Mr. Slope had remarked that the coping on <<target>> garden wall was in many places imperfect .::::the
Mrs. Proudie had discovered a large hole , evidently the <<target>> of rats , in the servants ' hall .::::work
The bishop expressed an <<target>> detestation of rats .::::utter
There was nothing , he believed , in this <<target>> that he so much hated as a rat .::::world
Mr. Slope had , moreover , observed that the locks of the outhouses <<target>> very imperfect : he might specify the coal-cellar and the woodhouse .::::were
The bishop thought that a great deal depended on a <<target>> lock and quite as much on the key .::::good
He had observed that the fault very often lay with the <<target>> , especially if the wards were in any way twisted .::::key
He was sorry , however , that so many things had been <<target>> amiss : and then he rose from his chair to escape .::::found
Mrs. Proudie , though she had contrived to lend her assistance in recapitulating the palatial dilapidations , had not on that <<target>> given up her hold of Mr. Harding , nor ceased from her cross-examinations as to the iniquity of Sabbatical amusements .::::account

But Mrs. Proudie interrogated <<target>> and then lectured .::::him
She shook her finger at him as she quoted the favourite law , as though menacing him with punishment , and then <<target>> upon him categorically to state whether he did not think that travelling on the Sabbath was an abomination and a desecration .::::called
Mr. Harding had never been so <<target>> pressed in his life .::::hard
He felt that he ought to rebuke the lady for presuming so to talk to a gentleman and a clergyman many years her senior , but he recoiled from the idea of scolding <<target>> bishop 's wife , in the bishop 's presence , on his first visit to the palace ; moreover , to tell the truth , he was somewhat afraid of her .::::the
`` I hope , Mr. Harding , '' said she , shaking her head slowly and solemnly , `` I hope you will not <<target>> me to think that you approve of Sabbath travelling , '' and she looked a look of unutterable meaning into his eyes .::::leave

Mr. Harding therefore got up also and , putting out his hand to Mrs. Proudie , said : `` If <<target>> will come to St. Cuthbert 's some Sunday , I will preach you a sermon on that subject . ''::::you
And so the archdeacon and the precentor took their departure , bowing low to the lady , <<target>> hands with the lord , and escaping from Mr. Slope in the best manner each could .::::shaking
Mr. Harding was again maltreated , but Dr. Grantly swore deeply in the bottom of his heart , that <<target>> earthly consideration should ever again induce him to touch the paw of that impure and filthy animal .::::no
And now , had I the pen of a mighty poet , <<target>> I sing in epic verse the noble wrath of the archdeacon .::::would
The palace steps descend to a broad gravel sweep , from whence a small gate <<target>> out into the street , very near the covered gateway leading into the close .::::opens
Till they had both passed this small gate and entered the close , neither of them spoke a word , but the precentor <<target>> saw from his companion 's face that a tornado was to be expected , nor was he himself inclined to stop it .::::clearly
exclaimed the archdeacon , as he placed his foot on the gravel walk of the close , and raising his hat with one hand , passed the other somewhat violently over his now grizzled locks ; <<target>> issued forth from the uplifted beaver as it were a cloud of wrath , and the safety valve of his anger opened , and emitted a visible steam , preventing positive explosion and probable apoplexy .::::smoke
-- and the archdeacon looked up to the gray pinnacles of the cathedral tower , making a mute appeal <<target>> that still living witness which had looked down on the doings of so many bishops of Barchester .::::to
`` I do n't think I shall ever like <<target>> Mr. Slope , '' said Mr. Harding .::::that
roared the archdeacon , standing still for a moment to give <<target>> force to his voice ; `` like him ! ''::::more
All the ravens of the <<target>> cawed their assent .::::close
Why no , it was not very probable that <<target>> Barchester-bred living thing should like Mr. Slope !::::any
The archdeacon hereupon <<target>> himself .::::forgot
I will not follow his example , nor shock my readers by transcribing the term <<target>> which he expressed his feeling as to the lady who had been named .::::in
The ravens and the last lingering notes of the clock bells were <<target>> scrupulous and repeated in correspondent echoes the very improper exclamation .::::less
The archdeacon again raised his hat , and <<target>> salutary escape of steam was effected .::::another
There was a pause , during which the precentor tried to realize the fact that the wife of a Bishop of Barchester had been <<target>> designated , in the close of the cathedral , by the lips of its own archdeacon ; but he could not do it .::::thus
`` The bishop seems to be a quiet man enough , '' <<target>> Mr. Harding , having acknowledged to himself his own failure .::::suggested
exclaimed the doctor , who for the nonce was not <<target>> of more than such spasmodic attempts at utterance .::::capable
I suppose he 's cautious and not <<target>> to express himself very freely . ''::::inclined
The new Bishop of Barchester was already so contemptible a creature in Dr. <<target>> 's eyes that he could not condescend to discuss his character .::::grantly
He was a puppet to be played by others ; a mere wax doll , done up in an apron and <<target>> shovel hat , to be stuck on a throne or elsewhere , and pulled about by wires as others chose .::::a
Dr. Grantly did not choose to let himself down low enough to talk about Dr. Proudie , but he saw that he would have to talk about the other members of his <<target>> , the coadjutor bishops , who had brought his lordship down , as it were , in a box , and were about to handle the wires as they willed .::::household
This in itself was a <<target>> vexation to the archdeacon .::::terrible
Could he have ignored the chaplain and have fought the bishop , there would <<target>> been , at any rate , nothing degrading in such a contest .::::have
Let the Queen make whom she would Bishop of Barchester ; a man , or even an ape , <<target>> once a bishop , would be a respectable adversary , if he would but fight , himself .::::when
But what was such a person as Dr. Grantly to do when <<target>> another person as Mr. Slope was put forward as his antagonist ?::::such
If he , our archdeacon , refused the combat , Mr. Slope would walk <<target>> over the field , and have the diocese of Barchester under his heel .::::triumphant
If , on the other hand , the archdeacon accepted as his enemy the man whom the new puppet bishop put before him as such , he would have to talk about Mr. <<target>> , and write about Mr. Slope , and in all matters treat with Mr. Slope , as a being standing , in some degree , on ground similar to his own .::::slope
He would have to meet Mr. <<target>> , to -- Bah !::::slope
He could not bring himself to <<target>> to do with Mr. Slope .::::have
`` He is the most thoroughly bestial creature that ever <<target>> set my eyes upon , '' said the archdeacon .::::i
`` Who -- <<target>> bishop ? ''::::the
no -- I 'm not <<target>> about the bishop .::::talking
`` Did you ever see any <<target>> less like a gentleman ? ''::::animal
`` I ca n't say I felt <<target>> much disposed to like him . ''::::myself
again shouted the doctor , and the assenting ravens again cawed an echo ; `` of <<target>> , you do n't like him : it 's not a question of liking .::::course
But what are we to <<target>> with him ? ''::::do
`` Do with <<target>> ? ''::::him
`` Yes -- what are <<target>> to do with him ?::::we
How are we <<target>> treat him ?::::to
There he is , and <<target>> he 'll stay .::::there
How are we to get <<target>> of him ? ''::::rid
`` I do n't suppose he <<target>> do us much harm . ''::::can
`` Not do harm ! -- Well , I think you 'll <<target>> yourself of a different opinion before a month is gone .::::find
What would you say now , if <<target>> got himself put into the hospital ?::::he
Would that be <<target>> ? ''::::harm
Mr. Harding mused awhile and then said he did n't think <<target>> new bishop would put Mr. Slope into the hospital .::::the
`` If he does n't put him there , he 'll <<target>> him somewhere else where he 'll be as bad .::::put
I tell you that that man , to all intents <<target>> purposes , will be Bishop of Barchester ! ''::::and
And again Dr. Grantly raised his hat and rubbed <<target>> hand thoughtfully and sadly over his head .::::his
he continued after <<target>> while .::::a
`` To dare to cross-examine me about the Sunday-schools in the diocese , and Sunday <<target>> too : I never in my life met his equal for sheer impudence .::::travelling
Why , he must have thought we <<target>> two candidates for ordination ! ''::::were
`` I declare I thought Mrs. Proudie was the <<target>> of the two , '' said Mr. Harding .::::worst
`` When a woman is impertinent , one must only put up with it , and keep out <<target>> her way in future , but I am not inclined to put up with Mr. Slope .::::of
and the doctor attempted to imitate the peculiar drawl of the <<target>> he so much disliked : `` 'Sabbath travelling ! '::::man
Those are the sort of men who will ruin the Church <<target>> England and make the profession of a clergyman disreputable .::::of
It is not the dissenters or the papists that we should fear , but the set of canting , low-bred hypocrites who are wriggling their way in among us ; men who <<target>> no fixed principle , no standard ideas of religion or doctrine , but who take up some popular cry , as this fellow has done about 'Sabbath travelling . ' ''::::have
Dr. Grantly did not again repeat the question aloud , but he did <<target>> constantly to himself : What were they to do with Mr. Slope ?::::so
How was he openly , before the world , to show <<target>> he utterly disapproved of and abhorred such a man ?::::that
Hitherto Barchester had escaped the taint of <<target>> extreme rigour of church doctrine .::::any
They all preached in their black gowns , as their fathers had done before them ; they wore ordinary black cloth waistcoats ; they had no candles on their altars , <<target>> lighted or unlighted ; they made no private genuflexions , and were contented to confine themselves to such ceremonial observances as had been in vogue for the last hundred years .::::either
The services were decently and demurely read in their parish churches , chanting <<target>> confined to the cathedral , and the science of intoning was unknown .::::was
One young man who had come direct from Oxford as a curate to Plumstead had , after the lapse of two <<target>> three Sundays , made a faint attempt , much to the bewilderment of the poorer part of the congregation .::::or
Dr. Grantly had not been present on the occasion , but Mrs. Grantly , who had her own opinion on the subject , immediately after the service expressed a <<target>> that the young gentleman had not been taken ill , and offered to send him all kinds of condiments supposed to be good for a sore throat .::::hope
After that there had been no <<target>> intoning at Plumstead Episcopi .::::more
But now the archdeacon began to meditate <<target>> some strong measures of absolute opposition .::::on
Dr. Proudie would abolish all forms and ceremonies , and <<target>> Dr. Grantly felt the sudden necessity of multiplying them .::::therefore
Dr. Proudie would consent to deprive the church of all collective authority and rule , and therefore Dr. <<target>> would stand up for the full power of convocation and the renewal of all its ancient privileges .::::grantly
It was true that he could not himself intone the service , but he could procure <<target>> co-operation of any number of gentlemanlike curates well trained in the mystery of doing so .::::the
He would not willingly alter his own fashion of dress , but he could people <<target>> with young clergymen dressed in the longest frocks and in the highest-breasted silk waistcoats .::::barchester
He certainly was not prepared to cross himself , or to advocate the real presence , but without going this length there <<target>> various observances , by adopting which he could plainly show his antipathy to such men as Dr. Proudie and Mr. Slope .::::were
All these things passed through his mind as he <<target>> up and down the close with Mr. Harding .::::paced
War , war , internecine <<target>> was in his heart .::::war
He felt that , as regarded himself and Mr. Slope , one of the two must be annihilated as far as the city of Barchester was <<target>> , and he did not intend to give way until there was not left to him an inch of ground on which he could stand .::::concerned
He still flattered himself that he could make Barchester too hot to hold Mr. Slope , and he had <<target>> weakness of spirit to prevent his bringing about such a consummation if it were in his power .::::no
`` I suppose Susan must call at <<target>> palace , '' said Mr. Harding .::::the
`` Yes , she shall call there , <<target>> it shall be once and once only .::::but
I dare say 'the horses ' wo n't find it convenient to come out to <<target>> very soon , and when that once is done the matter may drop . ''::::plumstead
`` I do n't <<target>> Eleanor need call .::::suppose
I do n't think Eleanor would get <<target>> at all well with Mrs .::::on
`` Not the least necessity in life , '' replied the archdeacon , not without the reflexion that a <<target>> which was necessary for his wife might not be at all binding on the widow of John Bold .::::ceremony
`` Not the slightest reason on earth why she should <<target>> so , if she does n't like it .::::do
For myself , I do n't think that any decent young woman should be <<target>> to the nuisance of being in the same room with that man . ''::::subjected
The new inhabitants of the palace did not express any higher <<target>> of their visitors than their visitors had expressed of them .::::opinion
Though they did not use quite such strong language as Dr. Grantly had done , they felt as much personal aversion , and were quite as well aware as <<target>> was that there would be a battle to be fought , and that there was hardly room for Proudieism in Barchester as long as Grantlyism was predominant .::::he
Indeed , it may be doubted whether Mr. Slope had not already within his breast a better <<target>> system of strategy , a more accurately defined line of hostile conduct than the archdeacon .::::prepared
Dr. Grantly was going to fight because <<target>> found that he hated the man .::::he
Mr. Slope had predetermined to hate the man <<target>> he foresaw the necessity of fighting him .::::because
When he had first reviewed the _carte du pays_ previous to his entry into Barchester , the idea had occurred to him of <<target>> the archdeacon , of cajoling and flattering him into submission , and of obtaining the upper hand by cunning instead of courage .::::conciliating
A little inquiry , however , sufficed to convince him that all his cunning would fail to win over such a man as Dr. Grantly <<target>> such a mode of action as that to be adopted by Mr. Slope , and then he determined to fall back upon his courage .::::to
He at once saw that open battle against Dr. Grantly and all Dr. Grantly 's adherents was <<target>> necessity of his position , and he deliberately planned the most expedient methods of giving offence .::::a
Soon after his arrival the bishop had intimated to the dean that , with the permission of <<target>> canon then in residence , his chaplain would preach in the cathedral on the next Sunday .::::the
The canon in residence happened <<target>> be the Hon .::::to
Dr. Vesey Stanhope , who at this time was very busy on the shores of the Lake <<target>> Como , adding to that unique collection of butterflies for which he is so famous .::::of
Or rather , he would have been in residence but for the butterflies and other such summer-day considerations ; and the vicar-choral , who <<target>> to take his place in the pulpit , by no means objected to having his work done for him by Mr. Slope .::::was
Mr. Slope accordingly preached , and if a preacher can have satisfaction <<target>> being listened to , Mr. Slope ought to have been gratified .::::in
I have reason to think that he was gratified , and that he left the pulpit <<target>> the conviction that he had done what he intended to do when he entered it .::::with
On this occasion the new bishop took his seat for <<target>> first time in the throne alloted to him .::::the
The old carved oak-wood of the throne , ascending with its numerous grotesque pinnacles half-way up to the roof of <<target>> choir , had been washed , and dusted , and rubbed , and it all looked very smart .::::the
how often sitting there , in happy early days , on those lowly benches in front of the altar , have I whiled away the <<target>> of a sermon in considering how best I might thread my way up amidst those wooden towers and climb safely to the topmost pinnacle !::::tedium
All Barchester went to hear Mr. Slope ; either <<target>> that or to gaze at the new bishop .::::for
Not a stall but had its fitting occupant , for though some of the prebendaries might be away <<target>> Italy or elsewhere , their places were filled by brethren who flocked into Barchester on the occasion .::::in
The dean was there , a heavy old man , now too old , <<target>> , to attend frequently in his place , and so was the archdeacon .::::indeed
So also were the chancellor , the treasurer , the precentor , sundry canons and minor canons , and every lay <<target>> of the choir , prepared to sing the new bishop in with due melody and harmonious expression of sacred welcome .::::member
The service was certainly <<target>> well performed .::::very
Such was always the case at Barchester , as the musical education of <<target>> choir had been good , and the voices had been carefully selected .::::the
The psalms were beautifully chanted ; the Te Deum was magnificently sung ; and the litany was given in a manner which <<target>> still to be found at Barchester , but , if my taste be correct , is to be found nowhere else .::::is
The litany in Barchester cathedral has long been the special task <<target>> which Mr. Harding 's skill and voice have been devoted .::::to
Crowded audiences generally make good performers , and though Mr. Harding was not aware of <<target>> extraordinary exertion on his part , yet probably he rather exceeded his usual mark .::::any
Others were doing their best , and it <<target>> natural that he should emulate his brethren .::::was
So the service went on , and at <<target>> Mr. Slope got into the pulpit .::::last
He chose for his text a verse from the precepts addressed by St. Paul to Timothy , as to the conduct necessary in <<target>> spiritual pastor and guide , and it was immediately evident that the good clergy of Barchester were to have a lesson .::::a
`` Study to show thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth <<target>> to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth . ''::::not
He was listened to with breathless <<target>> and not without considerable surprise .::::attention
Whatever opinion of Mr. Slope might have been held in Barchester before he commenced his discourse , none of <<target>> hearers , when it was over , could mistake him either for a fool or a coward .::::his
It would not be becoming were I to travesty a sermon , or <<target>> to repeat the language of it in the pages of a novel .::::even
I trust , however , that I shall not be thought to scoff at the pulpit , though <<target>> may imagine that I do not feel all the reverence that is due to the cloth .::::some
I may question the infallibility of the teachers , but I hope that I <<target>> not therefore be accused of doubt as to the thing to be taught .::::shall
Mr. Slope , in commencing his sermon , showed no slight tact in his ambiguous manner of hinting that , humble as he was himself , he stood there as the mouth-piece of the illustrious divine who <<target>> opposite to him ; and having premised so much , he gave forth a very accurate definition of the conduct which that prelate would rejoice to see in the clergymen now brought under his jurisdiction .::::sat
It is only necessary to say that the peculiar points insisted upon were exactly those which were most distasteful to the clergy of the diocese , and most averse to their practice and opinions , and that all <<target>> peculiar habits and privileges which have always been dear to High Church priests , to that party which is now scandalously called the `` high and dry church , '' were ridiculed , abused , and anathematized .::::those
Now , the clergymen of the diocese of Barchester <<target>> all of the high and dry church .::::are
Having thus , according to his own opinion , explained how a clergyman should show himself approved unto God , as a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , he <<target>> on to explain how the word of truth should be divided ; and here he took a rather narrow view of the question and fetched his arguments from afar .::::went
His object was to express his abomination of all ceremonious modes of utterance , to cry down any religious feeling which might <<target>> excited , not by the sense , but by the sound of words , and in fact to insult cathedral practices .::::be
Had St. Paul spoken of rightly pronouncing , instead of rightly dividing the word of truth , this part of his sermon would have been more to the purpose , but the <<target>> 's immediate object was to preach Mr. Slope 's doctrine , and not St. Paul 's , and he contrived to give the necessary twist to the text with some skill .::::preacher
He could not exactly say , preaching from a cathedral <<target>> , that chanting should be abandoned in cathedral services .::::pulpit
By such an assertion he would have overshot his mark and <<target>> himself absurd , to the delight of his hearers .::::rendered
He could , however , and did , allude with heavy denunciations to the practice of intoning in parish churches , although the practice was all but unknown in the <<target>> ; and from thence he came round to the undue preponderance which , he asserted , music had over meaning in the beautiful service which they had just heard .::::diocese
He was aware , he said , that the practices of our ancestors could not be abandoned at a moment 's <<target>> ; the feelings of the aged would be outraged , and the minds of respectable men would be shocked .::::notice
There were many , he was aware , of not sufficient calibre of thought to perceive , of not sufficient education to know , that a mode of service which was effective when outward ceremonies were of <<target>> moment than inward feelings , had become all but barbarous at a time when inward conviction was everything , when each word of the minister 's lips should fall intelligibly into the listener 's heart .::::more
Formerly the religion of the multitude had been an affair of the imagination : now , in these latter days , it had become necessary <<target>> a Christian should have a reason for his faith -- should not only believe , but digest -- not only hear , but understand .::::that
The words of our morning service , how beautiful , how apposite , <<target>> intelligible they were , when read with simple and distinct decorum !::::how
But how much of the meaning of the words was lost <<target>> they were produced with all the meretricious charms of melody !::::when
Before a whole dean and chapter <<target>> in their own cathedral !::::assembled

There was , at any rate , no tedium felt <<target>> listening to Mr. Slope on the occasion in question .::::in
His subject came too home to his audience to be dull , and , <<target>> tell the truth , Mr. Slope had the gift of using words forcibly .::::to
He was heard through his thirty minutes of eloquence with mute attention and open ears , but with angry eyes , which glared round from one enraged parson to another , with wide-spread nostrils from which <<target>> burst forth fumes of indignation , and with many shufflings of the feet and uneasy motions of the body , which betokened minds disturbed , and hearts not at peace with all the world .::::already
At last the bishop , who , of all the congregation , had been most surprised , and whose hair almost stood on end with terror , gave the blessing in <<target>> manner not at all equal to that in which he had long been practising it in his own study , and the congregation was free to go their way .::::a

All Barchester was <<target>> a tumult .::::in
Dr. Grantly could hardly get himself out of the <<target>> porch before he exploded in his wrath .::::cathedral
Mr. Harding crept forth solitary and unhappy ; and , slowly passing beneath the elms of the close , could <<target>> bring himself to believe that the words which he had heard had proceeded from the pulpit of Barchester cathedral .::::scarcely
Was he again <<target>> be disturbed ?::::to
Was his whole life to be shown up <<target>> a useless sham a second time ?::::as
Would he have to abdicate his precentorship , as he had his wardenship , and <<target>> give up chanting , as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen ?::::to
And what if <<target>> did !::::he
Some other Jupiter , some other Mr. Slope , would <<target>> and turn him out of St. Cuthbert 's .::::come
Surely he could not have been wrong all his <<target>> in chanting the litany as he had done !::::life
He began , however , <<target>> have his doubts .::::to
Doubting himself was Mr. <<target>> 's weakness .::::harding
It is not , however , <<target>> usual fault of his order .::::the
All Barchester was <<target>> a tumult .::::in
It was not only the <<target>> who were affected .::::clergy
They had spent their money and done good ; the poor had not been ground down ; the clergy in society <<target>> neither been overbearing nor austere ; and the whole repute of the city was due to its ecclesiastical importance .::::had
Yet there were those who had <<target>> Mr. Slope with satisfaction .::::heard
It is so pleasant to receive a fillip of excitement <<target>> suffering from the dull routine of everyday life !::::when
Mr. Slope was certainly not delightful , but he <<target>> new , and , moreover , clever .::::was
They had long thought it slow , so said now many of the Barchesterians , to go on as they had <<target>> in their old humdrum way , giving ear to none of the religious changes which were moving the world without .::::done
People in advance of the age now had new ideas , <<target>> it was quite time that Barchester should go in advance .::::and
Mr. Slope might <<target>> right .::::be
Sunday had certainly not been strictly kept in <<target>> , except as regarded the cathedral services .::::barchester
Indeed the two hours between services had long <<target>> appropriated to morning calls and hot luncheons .::::been
The late bishop had really not thought <<target>> Sunday-schools as he should have done .::::of
( These people probably did not reflect that catechisms and collects are quite as hard work to the young mind as bookkeeping <<target>> to the elderly , and that quite as little feeling of worship enters into the one task as the other . )::::is
And then , as regarded that great question of musical services , there might <<target>> much to be said on Mr. Slope 's side of the question .::::be
It certainly was the fact that people went to the <<target>> to hear the music , & c. & c::::cathedral
And so a party absolutely formed itself in Barchester <<target>> Mr. Slope 's side of the question !::::on
This consisted , among the upper <<target>> , chiefly of ladies .::::classes
No man -- that is , no gentleman -- could possibly be attracted by Mr. <<target>> , or consent to sit at the feet of so abhorrent a Gamaliel .::::slope
Ladies are sometimes less nice in their appreciation of physical disqualification ; provided that a man speak to <<target>> well , they will listen , though he speak from a mouth never so deformed and hideous .::::them
There were , however , one or two of the neighbouring clergy who thought it not quite safe to <<target>> the baskets in which for the nonce were stored the loaves and fishes of the diocese of Barchester .::::neglect
Among these Mr. Quiverful , the rector of Puddingdale , whose wife still continued to present him from year to year with fresh <<target>> of her love , and so to increase his cares and , it is to be hoped , his happiness equally .::::pledges
Who can wonder that a gentleman with fourteen living children and a bare income of Â£400 a year should <<target>> after the loaves and fishes , even when they are under the thumb of a Mr. Slope ?::::look
Very soon after the Sunday on which the sermon was preached , the leading clergy of <<target>> neighbourhood held high debate together as to how Mr. Slope should be put down .::::the
In the first place , he should never <<target>> preach from the pulpit of Barchester cathedral .::::again
Dr. Grantly declared that the power rested with the dean and chapter , observing that no clergyman <<target>> of the chapter had a claim to preach there , saving only the bishop himself .::::out
To this the dean assented , but alleged that contests on such a subject would be unseemly ; to which rejoined a meagre little doctor , one of the cathedral <<target>> , that the contest must be all on the side of Mr. Slope if every prebendary were always there ready to take his own place in the pulpit .::::prebendaries
Cunning little meagre doctor , whom it suits well to live in his own cosy house within Barchester close , and who is well content to have his <<target>> fling at Dr. Vesey Stanhope and other absentees , whose Italian villas , or enticing London homes , are more tempting than cathedral stalls and residences !::::little
To which the dean assented , <<target>> deeply at these truths .::::groaning
Thereupon , however , the meagre doctor remarked that they would be in the hands <<target>> their minor canons , one of whom might at any hour betray his trust .::::of
Whereon was heard from the burly chancellor an ejaculation sounding <<target>> like `` Pooh , pooh , pooh ! ''::::somewhat
but it might be that the worthy man was <<target>> blowing out the heavy breath from his windpipe .::::but
Why silence him <<target>> all ?::::at
So spoke our friend ; vainly ; for <<target>> ends must be attained by human means .::::human
But the dean saw a ray of hope <<target>> of those purblind old eyes of his .::::out
Yes , let them tell the bishop how distasteful to them was this Mr. Slope : a new bishop just come <<target>> his seat could not wish to insult his clergy while the gloss was yet fresh on his first apron .::::to
Then up rose Dr. Grantly and , having thus collected the scattered <<target>> of his associates , spoke forth with words of deep authority .::::wisdom
When I say up rose the archdeacon , I speak of the inner man , which then sprang up to more immediate action , for the doctor had <<target>> been standing all along with his back to the dean 's empty fire-grate , and the tails of his frock coat supported over his two arms .::::bodily
His hands were in <<target>> breeches pockets .::::his
`` It is quite clear that this man must <<target>> be allowed to preach again in this cathedral .::::not
We all see that , except our dear friend here , the milk of whose nature runs so softly that he would <<target>> have the heart to refuse the Pope the loan of his pulpit , if the Pope would come and ask it .::::not
We must not , however , allow <<target>> man to preach again here .::::the

The bishop was no more a party <<target>> it than was the dean here .::::to
You all know how grieved I am to see a bishop in this <<target>> holding the latitudinarian ideas by which Dr. Proudie has made himself conspicuous .::::diocese
You all know how greatly I should <<target>> the opinion of such a man .::::distrust
But in this matter I <<target>> him to be blameless .::::hold
I believe Dr. Proudie has lived too long among gentlemen to be guilty , <<target>> to instigate another to be guilty , of so gross an outrage .::::or

You , Mr. Dean , have suggested that we should appeal to the bishop to abstain from forcing <<target>> man on us ; but what if the bishop allow himself to be ruled by his chaplain ?::::this

My friend here has suggested that this man may again find his way into the pulpit by undertaking the duty of some of your minor canons , but <<target>> am sure that we may fully trust to these gentlemen to support us , when it is known that the dean objects to any such transfer . ''::::i
They had too long been accustomed to his rule to shake it off so soon , and in this particular <<target>> they had none of them a wish to abet the man whom he was so anxious to put down .::::case
Such a meeting as that we have just recorded is not <<target>> in such a city as Barchester unknown and untold of .::::held
All , however , agreed in saying that Mr. Slope was to be debarred from opening his mouth in the cathedral of Barchester ; many believed that the vergers were to be ordered to refuse him even the <<target>> of a seat ; and some of the most far-going advocates for strong measures declared that his sermon was looked upon as an indictable offence , and that proceedings were to be taken against him for brawling .::::accommodation
The party who were inclined to defend him -- the enthusiastically religious young ladies and the middle-aged spinsters desirous <<target>> a move -- of course took up his defence the more warmly on account of this attack .::::of
If they could not hear Mr. Slope in the cathedral , they would hear him elsewhere ; they would leave the dull dean , the dull old prebendaries , and the scarcely less dull young minor canons to preach to each <<target>> ; they would work slippers and cushions and hem bands for Mr. Slope , make him a happy martyr , and stick him up in some new Sion or Bethesda , and put the cathedral quite out of fashion .::::other
Dr. and Mrs. Proudie at <<target>> returned to London .::::once
They thought it expedient not to have to encounter any personal application from the dean and chapter respecting the sermon till the violence of the storm had expended itself ; but they left Mr. Slope behind them nothing daunted , and he went about his work zealously , flattering such as would <<target>> to his flattery , whispering religious twaddle into the ears of foolish women , ingratiating himself with the few clergy who would receive him , visiting the houses of the poor , inquiring into all people , prying into everything , and searching with his minutest eye into all palatial dilapidations .::::listen
He did not , however , make any <<target>> attempt to preach again in the cathedral .::::immediate
And so all Barchester <<target>> by the ears .::::was
The Ex-warden Rejoices in His <<target>> Return to the Hospital::::probable
Among the ladies in Barchester who have hitherto acknowledged Mr. Slope as their <<target>> director must not be reckoned either the Widow Bold or her sister-in-law .::::spiritual
Who could be so proud of the musical distinction of <<target>> own cathedral as the favourite daughter of the precentor ?::::their
Who would be so likely to resent <<target>> insult offered to the old choir ?::::an
And in such matters Miss Bold and <<target>> sister-in-law had but one opinion .::::her
This wrath , however , has in some degree been mitigated , and I <<target>> to say that these ladies allowed Mr. Slope to be his own apologist .::::regret
About a fortnight after the sermon had been preached , they were both of them not <<target>> little surprised by hearing Mr. Slope announced , as the page in buttons opened Mrs .::::a
Indeed , what living man could , by a <<target>> morning visit , have surprised them more ?::::mere
Here was the great enemy of all that was good in Barchester coming into their own drawing-room , <<target>> they had no strong arm , no ready tongue , near at hand for their protection .::::and
The widow snatched her baby out of its cradle into her lap , and Mary Bold stood up ready to <<target>> manfully in that baby 's behalf , should , under any circumstances , such a sacrifice become necessary .::::die
But when he left , he was allowed by each lady to take her <<target>> and to make his adieux as gentlemen do who have been graciously entertained !::::hand
Yes , he shook hands with them , and was curtseyed out courteously , the buttoned <<target>> opening the door as he would have done for the best canon of them all .::::page
And how had he <<target>> all this ?::::done
How had he so quickly turned aversion <<target>> , at any rate , acquaintance ?::::into
How had he over-come the enmity with which these ladies had been ready <<target>> receive him , and made his peace with them so easily ?::::to
My readers will guess from what I have written that I myself do not like Mr. <<target>> , but I am constrained to admit that he is a man of parts .::::slope
He knows how to say a soft word in the proper place ; he knows how to adapt his flattery <<target>> the ears of his hearers ; he knows the wiles of the serpent , and he uses them .::::to
Could Mr. Slope have adapted his manners to men as well as to women , could he <<target>> have learnt the ways of a gentleman , he might have risen to great things .::::ever
He commenced his acquaintance with <<target>> by praising her father .::::eleanor
And so he went on , unsaying a great deal of his sermon , expressing his highest admiration for the precentor 's musical talents , eulogizing the father and <<target>> daughter and the sister-in-law , speaking in that low silky whisper which he always had specially prepared for feminine ears , and , ultimately , gaining his object .::::the
When he left , he expressed a hope that he might again be allowed to call ; and though Eleanor gave no verbal assent <<target>> this , she did not express dissent : and so Mr. Slope 's right to visit at the widow 's house was established .::::to
The day after this visit Eleanor told her father of it and expressed an <<target>> that Mr. Slope was not quite so black as he had been painted .::::opinion
Mr. Harding opened his eyes rather wider than usual when he heard what had occurred , but he said little ; he <<target>> not agree in any praise of Mr. Slope , and it was not his practice to say much evil of anyone .::::could
He did not , however , like the visit , and simple-minded as he was , he felt sure <<target>> Mr. Slope had some deeper motive than the mere pleasure of making soft speeches to two ladies .::::that
Mr. Harding , however , had come to see his daughter with other <<target>> than that of speaking either good or evil of Mr. Slope .::::purpose

`` And have they <<target>> the matron ? ''::::appointed
`` They have n't appointed the <<target>> yet , '' replied he .::::warden
Mr. Harding explained that he thought there was no doubt ; that the archdeacon had declared as much , saying that the bishop and his chaplain between them <<target>> not the power to appoint anyone else , even if they had the will to do so , and sufficient impudence to carry out such a will .::::had
The archdeacon was of opinion that , though Mr. Harding had resigned his wardenship , and had done so unconditionally , he had done so under circumstances which <<target>> the bishop no choice as to his reappointment , now that the affair of the hospital had been settled on a new basis by act of Parliament .::::left
He had done all in his <<target>> to dissuade him from it .::::power
He had considered that Mr. Harding was bound to withstand the popular clamour with which he was attacked for receiving so large an income as eight <<target>> a year from such a charity , and was not even yet satisfied that his father-in-law 's conduct had not been pusillanimous and undignified .::::hundred
He looked also on this reduction of the warden 's income as a shabby , paltry scheme on the <<target>> of government for escaping from a difficulty into which it had been brought by the public press .::::part
Dr. Grantly observed that the government had no more right to dispose of a sum of four hundred and fifty pounds a year out of the income of Hiram 's <<target>> than of nine hundred ; whereas , as he said , the bishop , dean , and chapter clearly had a right to settle what sum should be paid .::::legacy
He also declared that the government had no more right to saddle the charity with twelve old <<target>> than with twelve hundred ; and he was , therefore , very indignant on the matter .::::women
He probably forgot when so talking that government had done nothing of the <<target>> , and had never assumed any such might or any such right .::::kind
He made the common mistake of attributing to the government , which in such matters <<target>> powerless , the doings of Parliament , which in such matters is omnipotent .::::is
But though he felt that the glory and honour of the situation of warden of Barchester Hospital were indeed curtailed by the new arrangement ; that the whole establishment had to a certain degree been made vile by the touch of Whig commissioners ; that the place , with its lessened income , its old women , and other <<target>> , was very different from the hospital of former days ; still the archdeacon was too practical a man of the world to wish that his father-in-law , who had at present little more than Â£200 per annum for all his wants , should refuse the situation , defiled , undignified , and commission-ridden as it was .::::innovations
The diminished income was to him not <<target>> the source of momentary regret .::::even
The matron and the old women did rather go against the grain , but he was able to console himself with <<target>> reflection that , after all , such an arrangement might be of real service to the poor of the city .::::the
The thought that he must receive his reappointment as the gift of the new bishop , and probably through the hands of Mr. Slope , annoyed him <<target>> little , but his mind was set at rest by the assurance of the archdeacon that there would be no favour in such a presentation .::::a
The reappointment of the old warden would be regarded <<target>> all the world as a matter of course .::::by
Mr. Harding , therefore , felt no hesitation in telling his daughter that they <<target>> look upon his return to his old quarters as a settled matter .::::might
`` And you wo n't have to <<target>> for it , Papa ? ''::::ask
There is no ground on which I could ask for any favour <<target>> the bishop , whom , indeed , I hardly know .::::from
Nor would I ask a favour , the granting of which might <<target>> be made a question to be settled by Mr. Slope .::::possibly
No , '' said he , moved for a moment by a spirit very unlike his own , `` I certainly shall be very glad to go back <<target>> the hospital ; but I should never go there if it were necessary that my doing so should be the subject of a request to Mr .::::to
This little outbreak of her father 's anger jarred <<target>> the present tone of Eleanor 's mind .::::on
She had not learnt to like Mr. Slope , but she had learnt to think that he had much respect for <<target>> father ; and she would , therefore , willingly use her efforts to induce something like good feeling between them .::::her
`` Papa , '' said she , `` I <<target>> you somewhat mistake Mr. Slope 's character . ''::::think
`` I think you <<target>> , Papa .::::do
I think he intended no personal disrespect to you when he preached <<target>> sermon which made the archdeacon and the dean so angry ! ''::::the
`` I never supposed he <<target>> , my dear .::::did
I hope I never inquired within <<target>> whether he did or no .::::myself
Such a matter would be unworthy of any inquiry , <<target>> very unworthy of the consideration of the chapter .::::and
But I fear he intended disrespect to the ministration of God 's services , <<target>> conducted in conformity with the rules of the Church of England . ''::::as
`` But might it not be that he thought it his duty to express his dissent from <<target>> which you , and the dean , and all of us here so much approve ? ''::::that
`` It can hardly be the duty of a young man rudely <<target>> assail the religious convictions of his elders in the church .::::to

`` Nor of his being <<target>> , Eleanor ? ''::::courteous
`` He did not say <<target>> , Papa . ''::::that
`` Believe me , my child , that Christian ministers are never called on by God 's word to insult the convictions , or even the prejudices of their <<target>> , and that religion is at any rate not less susceptible of urbane and courteous conduct among men than any other study which men may take up .::::brethren

Among other things absentee clergymen have been favoured <<target>> hints much too strong to be overlooked .::::with
Poor dear old Bishop Grantly had on this matter been too lenient , and the archdeacon had never been inclined to <<target>> severe with those who were absent on reputable pretences , and who provided for their duties in a liberal way .::::be
Among the greatest of the diocesan sinners <<target>> this respect was Dr. Vesey Stanhope .::::in
Years had now passed since he had done a day 's duty , and yet there <<target>> no reason against his doing duty except a want of inclination on his own part .::::was
He held a prebendal stall in the diocese , one of the best residences <<target>> the close , and the two large rectories of Crabtree Canonicorum and Stogpingum .::::in
He had resided in <<target>> for twelve years .::::italy
His first going there had been attributed to a sore throat , and that sore throat , though never repeated in any <<target>> manner , had stood him in such stead that it had enabled him to live in easy idleness ever since .::::violent
He had now been summoned home -- not , indeed , with rough violence , or <<target>> any peremptory command , but by a mandate which he found himself unable to disregard .::::by
Mr. Slope had written to him <<target>> the bishop 's desire .::::by
There was something so ambiguously frightful in this last threat that Dr. Stanhope <<target>> to spend two or three summer months at his residence in Barchester .::::determined
His rectories were inhabited by his curates , and he felt himself from disuse to be unfit for parochial duty ; but his prebendal home <<target>> kept empty for him , and he thought it probable that he might be able now and again to preach a prebendal sermon .::::was
The great family characteristic of the Stanhopes might probably be said to be heartlessness , but this want of feeling was , in <<target>> of them , accompanied by so great an amount of good nature as to make itself but little noticeable to the world .::::most
They were so prone to oblige their neighbours that their neighbours failed to perceive <<target>> indifferent to them was the happiness and well-being of those around them .::::how
Their conduct to each other was the same as to the world ; they bore and forbore ; and there was <<target>> , as will be seen , much necessity for forbearing ; but their love among themselves rarely reached above this .::::sometimes
It is astonishing how much each of the family was able to do , <<target>> how much each did , to prevent the well-being of the other four .::::and
The doctor , perhaps , was the least singular and most estimable of them <<target>> , and yet such good qualities as he possessed were all negative .::::all
He was a good-looking rather plethoric gentleman <<target>> about sixty years of age .::::of
His hair was snow-white , very plentiful , <<target>> somewhat like wool of the finest description .::::and
His whiskers were very large and very white , and gave to <<target>> face the appearance of a benevolent , sleepy old lion .::::his
His dress was <<target>> unexceptionable .::::always
Although he had lived so many years in Italy it was invariably <<target>> a decent clerical hue , but it never was hyperclerical .::::of
He was a man not given to much talking , <<target>> what little he did say was generally well said .::::but
His reading seldom went beyond romances and poetry of <<target>> lightest and not always most moral description .::::the
He was thoroughly a _bon vivant_ ; an accomplished judge of wine , though he never <<target>> to excess ; and a most inexorable critic in all affairs touching the kitchen .::::drank
He had had much to forgive in his own family , since a family had <<target>> up around him , and had forgiven everything -- except inattention to his dinner .::::grown
His weakness in that respect was now fully <<target>> , and his temper but seldom tried .::::understood
As Dr. Stanhope was a clergyman , it may be supposed that his religious convictions <<target>> up a considerable part of his character , but this was not so .::::made
That he had religious convictions must be believed , but <<target>> rarely obtruded them , even on his children .::::he
It was not that he had predetermined never to influence their thoughts , but he was so habitually idle <<target>> his time for doing so had never come till the opportunity for doing so was gone forever .::::that
Whatever conviction the father may have had , the children were at any <<target>> but indifferent members of the church from which he drew his income .::::rate
The features of Mrs. Stanhope 's character were even <<target>> plainly marked than those of her lord .::::less
The _far niente_ of her Italian life had entered into her very soul , <<target>> brought her to regard a state of inactivity as the only earthly good .::::and
In manner and appearance <<target>> was exceedingly prepossessing .::::she
Her dress was always perfect : she never dressed but once in the day , and never appeared <<target>> between three and four ; but when she did appear , she appeared at her best .::::till
Whether the toil rested partly with her , or wholly with her handmaid , <<target>> is not for such a one as the author even to imagine .::::it
The structure of her attire was <<target>> elaborate and yet never over-laboured .::::always

Other purpose in life <<target>> had none .::::she
It was something , indeed , that she <<target>> not interfere with the purposes of others .::::did
In early life she had undergone great trials with reference to the doctor 's dinners , but for the last ten or twelve years her elder daughter Charlotte had taken that labour off her hands , and <<target>> had had little to trouble her -- little , that is , till the edict for this terrible English journey had gone forth : since then , indeed , her life had been laborious enough .::::she
For such a one , the toil of being carried from the shores of Como to the city <<target>> Barchester is more than labour enough , let the care of the carriers be ever so vigilant .::::of
Mrs. Stanhope had been obliged to have every one of <<target>> dresses taken in from the effects of the journey .::::her
Charlotte Stanhope was at this time about thirty-five years old , and whatever may have been <<target>> faults , she had none of those which belong particularly to old young ladies .::::her
She neither dressed young , nor talked <<target>> , nor indeed looked young .::::young

So far , the character of <<target>> Stanhope is not unprepossessing .::::charlotte
But it remains to be said that the influence which she had in her family , though it had been used to <<target>> certain extent for their worldly well-being , had not been used to their real benefit , as it might have been .::::a
She had aided her father in his indifference to his professional duties , counselling him that his livings were <<target>> much his individual property as the estates of his elder brother were the property of that worthy peer .::::as
She had for years past stifled every little rising wish for a <<target>> to England which the doctor had from time to time expressed .::::return
She had encouraged her mother in her idleness , in order that <<target>> herself might be mistress and manager of the Stanhope household .::::she
She had encouraged and fostered the follies of her sister , though she was <<target>> willing , and often able , to protect her from their probable result .::::always
She had done her best , and had thoroughly succeeded in spoiling her brother , and turning him loose <<target>> the world an idle man without a profession and without a shilling that he could call his own .::::upon
Miss Stanhope was a clever woman , able to talk on most <<target>> , and quite indifferent as to what the subject was .::::subjects
She prided herself on her freedom from English prejudice , <<target>> , she might have added , from feminine delicacy .::::and

But the two most prominent members of <<target>> family still remain to be described .::::the
The second child had been christened Madeline <<target>> had been a great beauty .::::and
We need not say had been , for she was never more beautiful than at the time <<target>> which we write , though her person for many years had been disfigured by an accident .::::of
It is unnecessary that we should give in <<target>> the early history of Madeline Stanhope .::::detail
She had gone to Italy when about seventeen years of age , and had been allowed to make the most of <<target>> surpassing beauty in the salons of Milan and among the crowded villas along the shores of the Lake of Como .::::her
She had become famous for adventures in which her character was just not lost , and <<target>> destroyed the hearts of a dozen cavaliers without once being touched in her own .::::had
Blood had flowed in quarrels about her charms , and <<target>> had heard of these encounters with pleasurable excitement .::::she
It had been told of her that on one occasion she had stood <<target>> in the disguise of a page and had seen her lover fall .::::by
As is so often the case , she had married <<target>> very worst of those who sought her hand .::::the
Why she had chosen Paulo Neroni , a man of no birth and no property , a mere captain in the Pope 's guard , one who had come up to Milan either simply as an adventurer or <<target>> as a spy , a man of harsh temper and oily manners , mean in figure , swarthy in face , and so false in words as to be hourly detected , need not now be told .::::else
He , at any rate , had become her husband , and after a prolonged honeymoon among the lakes , they <<target>> gone together to Rome , the papal captain having vainly endeavoured to induce his wife to remain behind him .::::had
She had arrived without even notice , with hardly clothes to cover her , <<target>> without one of those many ornaments which had graced her bridal trousseau .::::and
Her baby was in the arms of a poor girl from Milan , whom she had taken in exchange for the Roman maid <<target>> had accompanied her thus far , and who had then , as her mistress said , become homesick and had returned .::::who
It was clear that the lady had determined that there should <<target>> no witness to tell stories of her life in Rome .::::be
She had fallen , she said , in ascending a ruin , and had fatally injured the sinews of her knee ; so fatally that when she stood , she lost eight inches of her accustomed <<target>> ; so fatally that when she essayed to move , she could only drag herself painfully along , with protruded hip and extended foot , in a manner less graceful than that of a hunchback .::::height
She had consequently made up her mind , once and forever , <<target>> she would never stand and never attempt to move herself .::::that
Be that as it may , little had been said about her husband , but that little had made <<target>> clearly intelligible to the family that Signor Neroni was to be seen and heard of no more .::::it
There was no question as to readmitting the poor , ill-used beauty to her old <<target>> rights , no question as to adopting her infant daughter beneath the Stanhope roof-tree .::::family

Madame Neroni , though forced to give up all motion in the <<target>> , had no intention whatever of giving up the world itself .::::world

Her copious rich brown hair was worn in Grecian bandeaux round her <<target>> , displaying as much as possible of her forehead and cheeks .::::head
Her forehead , though rather low , was very <<target>> from its perfect contour and pearly whiteness .::::beautiful
Her eyes were long and large , and marvellously bright ; might I venture to say <<target>> as Lucifer 's , I should perhaps best express the depth of their brilliancy .::::bright
They were dreadful eyes to look at , such as would absolutely deter any man <<target>> quiet mind and easy spirit from attempting a passage of arms with such foes .::::of
There was talent in them , and the fire of passion <<target>> the play of wit , but there was no love .::::and
Cruelty was there instead , and courage , a desire <<target>> masterhood , cunning , and a wish for mischief .::::of
The eyelashes were long and perfect , and the long , steady , unabashed gaze with <<target>> she would look into the face of her admirer fascinated while it frightened him .::::which

She had still frequented the opera at Milan ; she had still been seen occasionally in the salons of the noblesse ; she had caused herself to be carried in <<target>> out from her carriage , and that in such a manner as in no wise to disturb her charms , disarrange her dress , or expose her deformities .::::and
Her sister always accompanied her and a maid , a <<target>> also , and on state occasions , two .::::manservant
It was impossible that her purpose could have been achieved with less ; <<target>> yet , poor as she was , she had achieved her purpose .::::and
And then again the more dissolute Italian youths of Milan frequented the Stanhope <<target>> and surrounded her couch , not greatly to her father 's satisfaction .::::villa
Sometimes his spirit would rise , a dark spot would show itself on his cheek , and he would rebel , <<target>> Charlotte would assuage him with some peculiar triumph of her culinary art and all again would be smooth for awhile .::::but
Madeline affected all manner of rich and quaint devices in the garniture <<target>> her room , her person , and her feminine belongings .::::of
In nothing was this more apparent than in the <<target>> card which she had prepared for her use .::::visiting
For such an article one would say that she , in her present state , could have but small need , <<target>> how improbable it was that she should make a morning call : but not such was her own opinion .::::seeing
La Signora Madeline <<target>> Neroni .::::vesey
And over the name she had a bright <<target>> coronet , which certainly looked very magnificent .::::gilt
How she had come to concoct such a name <<target>> herself it would be difficult to explain .::::for
Her father had been christened Vesey as another man is christened Thomas , and she had no more right to assume it than would <<target>> the daughter of a Mr. Josiah Jones to call herself Mrs. Josiah Smith , on marrying a man of the latter name .::::have
Paulo Neroni had had not the faintest title to <<target>> himself a scion of even Italian nobility .::::call
Had the pair met in England Neroni would probably have been a count , but they had <<target>> in Italy , and any such pretence on his part would have been simply ridiculous .::::met
A coronet , however , was a pretty ornament , and if it could solace a <<target>> cripple to have such on her card , who would begrudge it to her ?::::poor
Of her husband , or of his individual family , she never spoke , but with her admirers she would often allude in a mysterious way to her married life and isolated state , and , <<target>> to her daughter , would call her the last of the blood of the emperors , thus referring Neroni 's extraction to the old Roman family from which the worst of the Caesars sprang .::::pointing
The `` signora '' was not without talent and not without a certain sort of industry ; she was an indomitable letter-writer , and her letters were worth the <<target>> : they were full of wit , mischief , satire , love , latitudinarian philosophy , free religion , and , sometimes , alas , loose ribaldry .::::postage
The subject , however , depended entirely on the recipient , and she was <<target>> to correspond with anyone but moral young ladies or stiff old women .::::prepared
She wrote also a kind of poetry , generally in <<target>> , and short romances , generally in French .::::italian
She read much of a desultory sort of literature , <<target>> as a modern linguist had really made great proficiency .::::and
Such was the lady who had now come to <<target>> the hearts of the men of Barchester .::::wound
Ethelbert Stanhope was in some respects like his younger sister , but <<target>> was less inestimable as a man than she as a woman .::::he
Many attempts had been made to get him to do so , but these had all been frustrated , not so <<target>> by idleness on his part as by a disinclination to exert himself in any way not to his taste .::::much
He had been educated at Eton and had been intended for the Church , but he had left Cambridge <<target>> disgust after a single term , and notified to his father his intention to study for the bar .::::in
Preparatory to that , he thought it well that he should <<target>> a German university , and consequently went to Leipzig .::::attend
There he remained two years and brought away a knowledge <<target>> German and a taste for the fine arts .::::of
He still , however , intended himself for the bar , took chambers , engaged himself <<target>> sit at the feet of a learned pundit , and spent a season in London .::::to
He there found that all his aptitudes inclined him to the life <<target>> an artist , and he determined to live by painting .::::of
With this object he returned to Milan , <<target>> had himself rigged out for Rome .::::and
As a painter he might have earned his bread , for he wanted only diligence to excel , but when at Rome his mind was carried away by other things : he soon wrote home for money , <<target>> that he had been converted to the Mother Church , that he was already an acolyte of the Jesuits , and that he was about to start with others to Palestine on a mission for converting Jews .::::saying
He did go to Judea , but being unable <<target>> convert the Jews , was converted by them .::::to
He again wrote home , to say that Moses was the only giver of perfect laws to the world , that the coming of the true Messiah was at hand , that great things were doing in Palestine , and that he had <<target>> one of the family of Sidonia , a most remarkable man , who was now on his way to western Europe , and whom he had induced to deviate from his route with the object of calling at the Stanhope villa .::::met
Ethelbert then expressed his hope that his mother <<target>> sisters would listen to this wonderful prophet .::::and
His father he knew could not <<target>> so from pecuniary considerations .::::do
This Sidonia , however , did not take so strong a fancy to <<target>> as another of that family once did to a young English nobleman .::::him
At least he provided him with no heaps of gold as large as lions , so <<target>> the Judaized Ethelbert was again obliged to draw on the revenues of the Christian Church .::::that
It is needless to tell how the father swore that he would send no more money and receive no Jew , nor how Charlotte declared <<target>> Ethelbert could not be left penniless in Jerusalem , and how `` La Signora Neroni '' resolved to have Sidonia at her feet .::::that
The money was sent , <<target>> the Jew did come .::::and
The Jew did come , but he was not at <<target>> to the taste of `` La Signora . ''::::all
He was a dirty little old man , and though he had provided no <<target>> lions , he had , it seems , relieved young Stanhope 's necessities .::::golden
He positively refused to leave the villa till he had <<target>> a bill from the doctor on his London bankers .::::got
Ethelbert did not long <<target>> a Jew .::::remain
He brought with him some models which he had originated at Rome and which really gave such <<target>> promise that his father was induced to go to further expense in furthering these views .::::fair
Ethelbert opened an establishment , or rather took lodgings and a workshop , at <<target>> , and there spoilt much marble and made some few pretty images .::::carrara
Since that period , now four years ago , he had alternated between Carrara and the villa , <<target>> his sojourns at the workshop became shorter and shorter and those at the villa longer and longer .::::but
'T was no wonder , for Carrara is not a <<target>> in which an Englishman would like to dwell .::::spot
When the family started for England , he had resolved not to be left behind , and , <<target>> the assistance of his elder sister , had carried his point against his father 's wishes .::::with
It was necessary , he said , that <<target>> should come to England for orders .::::he
How otherwise was he to <<target>> his profession to account ?::::bring
In personal appearance Ethelbert Stanhope was <<target>> most singular of beings .::::the
He was certainly <<target>> handsome .::::very
He had his sister Madeline 's eyes , without their <<target>> and without their hard , cunning , cruel firmness .::::stare
They were also very much lighter , and of so light and clear a <<target>> as to make his face remarkable , if nothing else did so .::::blue
On entering a room with him , Ethelbert 's blue eyes would be the first <<target>> you would see , and on leaving it almost the last you would forget .::::thing
His light hair was very long and <<target>> , coming down over his coat .::::silky
His beard had been prepared in <<target>> land , and was patriarchal .::::holy
He never shaved and <<target>> trimmed it .::::rarely
It was glossy , soft , <<target>> , and altogether not unprepossessing .::::clean
It was such that ladies might desire to reel it off <<target>> work it into their patterns in lieu of floss silk .::::and
His complexion was fair and almost pink ; he was small in height and <<target>> in limb , but well-made ; and his voice was of peculiar sweetness .::::slender
In manner and dress <<target>> was equally remarkable .::::he
He required no introduction to make <<target>> agreeable to any person .::::himself
He habitually addressed strangers , ladies as well as men , without any <<target>> formality , and in doing so never seemed to meet with rebuke .::::such
His costume can not be described because it was so various , but it was always totally opposed in <<target>> principle of colour and construction to the dress of those with whom he for the time consorted .::::every
He was habitually addicted to making love to ladies , and did so without <<target>> scruples of conscience , or any idea that such a practice was amiss .::::any
He had no heart to touch himself , and was <<target>> unaware that humanity was subject to such an infliction .::::literally
He had not thought much about it , but , had he been asked , would <<target>> said that ill-treating a lady 's heart meant injuring her promotion in the world .::::have
His principles therefore forbade him to pay attention to a girl if he <<target>> any man was present whom it might suit her to marry .::::thought
In this manner his good nature frequently interfered with his amusement , but he had no other <<target>> in abstaining from the fullest declarations of love to every girl that pleased his eye .::::motive
Bertie Stanhope , as he was generally called , was , however , <<target>> with both sexes -- and with Italians as well as English .::::popular
His circle of acquaintance was very large <<target>> embraced people of all sorts .::::and
He had no respect for rank , <<target>> no aversion to those below him .::::and
He had lived on familiar terms with English <<target>> , German shopkeepers , and Roman priests .::::peers
All people were nearly <<target>> to him .::::alike
He was above , or <<target>> below , all prejudices .::::rather
He had about him a natural good manner , which seemed to qualify him for <<target>> highest circles , and yet he was never out of place in the lowest .::::the
He had no principle , no regard for others , no self-respect , no desire to be other than a drone <<target>> the hive , if only he could , as a drone , get what honey was sufficient for him .::::in
Of honey , in his latter days , it may probably <<target>> presaged , that he will have but short allowance .::::be
Such was the family of the Stanhopes , who , at this <<target>> , suddenly joined themselves to the ecclesiastical circle of Barchester close .::::period
Any stranger union it would <<target>> impossible perhaps to conceive .::::be
And it was not as though they all fell down <<target>> the cathedral precincts hitherto unknown and untalked of .::::into
In such case , no amalgamation would have been at all probable <<target>> the new-comers and either the Proudie set or the Grantly set .::::between
But such was far <<target>> being the case .::::from
The Stanhopes were all known by name in Barchester , <<target>> Barchester was prepared to receive them with open arms .::::and
The doctor was one of her prebendaries , one of her rectors , one of her pillars of <<target>> ; and was , moreover , counted on as a sure ally both by Proudies and Grantlys .::::strength
He himself was the brother of one peer , and his wife was the sister of another -- and <<target>> these peers were lords of Whiggish tendency , with whom the new bishop had some sort of alliance .::::both
This was sufficient to give to Mr. Slope high hope that he might <<target>> Dr. Stanhope on his side , before his enemies could outmanoeuvre him .::::enlist
On the other hand , the old dean had many many years ago , in the days of the doctor 's clerical energies , been instrumental in assisting him in his views as <<target>> preferment ; and many many years ago also , the two doctors , Stanhope and Grantly , had , as young parsons , been joyous together in the common-rooms of Oxford .::::to
Dr. Grantly , consequently , did not doubt but <<target>> the newcomer would range himself under his banners .::::that
Little did any of them dream of what <<target>> the Stanhope family was now composed .::::ingredients
Mrs. Proudie 's <<target>> -- Commenced::::reception
The bishop and his wife had spent only three or four <<target>> in Barchester on the occasion of their first visit .::::days
His lordship had , as we have seen , taken his seat on his throne , but his demeanour there , into which it <<target>> been his intention to infuse much hierarchal dignity , had been a good deal disarranged by the audacity of his chaplain 's sermon .::::had
He had hardly dared to look his clergy in the face , and to declare by the severity of his countenance that in truth he meant all that his factotum was saying on <<target>> behalf ; nor yet did he dare to throw Mr. Slope over , and show to those around him that he was no party to the sermon , and would resent it .::::his
He had accordingly blessed his people in a shambling manner , not at all to his own satisfaction , and had walked <<target>> to his palace with his mind very doubtful as to what he would say to his chaplain on the subject .::::back
He did not remain <<target>> in doubt .::::long
He had hardly doffed his lawn when the partner of all his <<target>> entered his study and exclaimed even before she had seated herself :::::toils
`` Well , my love ; <<target>> -- hum -- he ! ''::::ha
The bishop did not <<target>> what to say .::::know
`` I hope , my lord , you <<target>> n't mean to say you disapprove ? ''::::do
There was a look about the lady 's eye which did <<target>> admit of my lord 's disapproving at that moment .::::not
He felt that if he intended to disapprove , it must be now <<target>> never ; but he also felt that it could not be now .::::or
It was not in him to say to the wife of his bosom <<target>> Mr. Slope 's sermon was ill-timed , impertinent , and vexatious .::::that
`` No , I ca n't say I disapprove -- a very clever sermon and very <<target>> intended , and I dare say will do a great deal of good . ''::::well
This last praise was added , seeing that what he <<target>> already said by no means satisfied Mrs. Proudie .::::had
`` And I am sure <<target>> was well deserved .::::it
Did you ever in your life , bishop , hear anything so <<target>> play-acting as the way in which Mr. Harding sings the litany ?::::like
I shall beg Mr. Slope to continue a course of <<target>> on the subject till all that is altered .::::sermons
The bishop knew more about cathedrals and deans and precentors and church services <<target>> his wife did , and also more of a bishop 's powers .::::than
But he thought it better at <<target>> to let the subject drop .::::present
`` My dear , '' said he , `` I <<target>> we must go back to London on Tuesday .::::think
I find my staying here will be <<target>> inconvenient to the Government . ''::::very
The bishop knew that to this proposal his wife would not object , and he also felt that by <<target>> retreating from the ground of battle the heat of the fight might be got over in his absence .::::thus
`` Mr. Slope will remain <<target>> , of course ? ''::::here
Thus , after less than a week 's sojourn in his palace , did the bishop fly from <<target>> ; nor did he return to it for two months , the London season being then over .::::barchester
During that time Mr. Slope was not idle , but <<target>> did not again essay to preach in the cathedral .::::he
In answer to Mrs. Proudie 's letters advising a course of sermons , he had pleaded that he <<target>> at any rate wish to put off such an undertaking till she was there to hear them .::::would
He had employed his time in consolidating a Proudie and Slope party -- or rather <<target>> Slope and Proudie party , and he had not employed his time in vain .::::a
He did not meddle with the dean and chapter , except by giving them little teasing intimations of the bishop 's wishes about this <<target>> the bishop 's feelings about that , in a manner which was to them sufficiently annoying , but which they could not resent .::::and
He preached once or twice in a distant church in the suburbs <<target>> the city , but made no allusion to the cathedral service .::::of
At the end of two months , however , the bishop and the lady reappeared , and as a happy <<target>> of their return , heralded their advent by the promise of an evening party on the largest scale .::::harbinger
The tickets of invitation were sent out from London -- they were dated from Bruton Street , and <<target>> dispatched by the odious Sabbath-breaking railway , in a huge brown paper parcel to Mr. Slope .::::were
Everybody calling himself a gentleman , or herself a lady , within the city <<target>> Barchester , and a circle of two miles round it , was included .::::of
It was intended , however , to be a thronged and <<target>> affair , and preparations were made for receiving some hundreds .::::noticeable
And now there arose considerable agitation among the Grantlyites <<target>> or no they would attend the episcopal bidding .::::whether
The first feeling with them all was to send the <<target>> excuses both for themselves and their wives and daughters .::::briefest
But by degrees policy <<target>> over passion .::::prevailed
The archdeacon perceived that he would be making a false step if he <<target>> the cathedral clergy to give the bishop just ground of umbrage .::::allowed
They all met in conclave <<target>> agreed to go .::::and
They would show that they were willing to respect the <<target>> , much as they might dislike the man .::::office
The old dean would crawl in , if <<target>> were but for half an hour .::::it
The chancellor , treasurer , archdeacon , prebendaries , and minor <<target>> would all go , and would all take their wives .::::canons
Mr. Harding was especially bidden to do so , resolving in <<target>> heart to keep himself far removed from Mrs. Proudie .::::his
Bold was determined to go , though assured by her father that <<target>> was no necessity for such a sacrifice on her part .::::there
When all Barchester was to be there , neither Eleanor <<target>> Mary Bold understood why they should stay away .::::nor
Had they not <<target>> invited separately ?::::been
And had not a separate little note from the chaplain , couched in <<target>> most respectful language , been enclosed with the huge episcopal card ?::::the
And the Stanhopes would be <<target>> , one and all .::::there
Even the lethargic mother would so far <<target>> herself on such an occasion .::::bestir
They had only <<target>> arrived .::::just
The card was at the <<target>> waiting for them .::::residence
No one in Barchester <<target>> seen them .::::had
What better opportunity could they have of <<target>> themselves to the Barchester world ?::::showing
Some few old friends , such as the archdeacon and his wife , had called and had found <<target>> doctor and his eldest daughter , but the _Ã©lite_ of the family were not yet known .::::the
If her father was ashamed of having his daughter carried into <<target>> bishop 's palace , she had no such feeling .::::a
`` Indeed , I shall , '' she had said to her sister who had gently endeavoured to <<target>> her , by saying that the company would consist wholly of parsons and parsons ' wives .::::dissuade
`` Parsons , I suppose , are much the same as other men , if you strip them of <<target>> black coats ; and as to their wives , I dare say they wo n't trouble me .::::their
You may tell Papa I do n't at <<target>> mean to be left at home . ''::::all
Papa was told , and felt that <<target>> could do nothing but yield .::::he
He also felt that it was useless for <<target>> now to be ashamed of his children .::::him
Such as they were , they had become such under his auspices ; as he had made his bed , <<target>> he must lie upon it ; as he had sown his seed , so must he reap his corn .::::so
It was not because Madeline was a cripple that he shrank from seeing her made one of the bishop 's guests , but because he knew <<target>> she would practise her accustomed lures , and behave herself in a way that could not fail of being distasteful to the propriety of Englishwomen .::::that
These things had annoyed but <<target>> shocked him in Italy .::::not
There they had shocked no one ; but here in Barchester , here <<target>> his fellow parsons , he was ashamed that they should be seen .::::among
What if his brother <<target>> were shocked !::::clergymen
They could not take from him his preferment because <<target>> manners of his married daughter were too free .::::the
Her ambition was to create a sensation , to have parsons at her feet , seeing that the manhood of Barchester consisted <<target>> of parsons , and to send , if possible , every parson 's wife home with a green fit of jealousy .::::mainly
None too sanctified , <<target>> none too worldly .::::and
She was quite prepared to entrap the bishop himself , and <<target>> to turn up her nose at the bishop 's wife .::::then
She did not doubt of success , for she had always succeeded ; but one <<target>> was absolutely necessary ; she must secure the entire use of a sofa .::::thing
The card sent to Dr. and Mrs. Stanhope and family had been so <<target>> in an envelope having on the cover Mr. Slope 's name .::::sent
The signora soon learnt that Mrs. Proudie was not yet <<target>> the palace and that the chaplain was managing everything .::::at
It was much more in her line to apply to him than to the <<target>> , and she accordingly wrote him the prettiest little billet in the world .::::lady
In five lines she explained everything , declared how impossible it was for her not to be desirous to make the acquaintance of such persons as the Bishop of Barchester and his wife , and she might <<target>> also of Mr. Slope , depicted her own grievous state , and concluded by being assured that Mrs. Proudie would forgive her extreme hardihood in petitioning to be allowed to be carried to a sofa .::::add
She then enclosed one <<target>> her beautiful cards .::::of
In return she received as polite an answer from Mr. Slope -- a sofa should be kept in <<target>> large drawing-room , immediately at the top of the grand stairs , especially for her use .::::the
And now the day of <<target>> party had arrived .::::the
The bishop and his wife came down from town only on the morning of the eventful day , as behoved such great <<target>> to do , but Mr. Slope had toiled day and night to see that everything should be in right order .::::people
There had been <<target>> to do .::::much
No company had been seen in <<target>> palace since heaven knows when .::::the
Mrs. Proudie had at first declared that she would condescend to nothing so vulgar as eating <<target>> drinking , but Mr. Slope had talked , or rather written her out of economy .::::and
Bishops should be given to hospitality , <<target>> hospitality meant eating and drinking .::::and
So the supper was conceded ; the guests , <<target>> , were to stand as they consumed it .::::however
The present bishop , however , had been moved down into a back parlour and had been given to understand that he could very <<target>> receive his clergy in the dining-room , should they arrive in too large a flock to be admitted into his small sanctum .::::well
He had been unwilling to yield , <<target>> after a short debate had yielded .::::but
Mrs. Proudie 's heart beat high as <<target>> inspected her suite of rooms .::::she
They were really very magnificent , or at least would be so by <<target>> , and they had nevertheless been got up with commendable economy .::::candlelight
Large rooms when full of people and full of light look well , <<target>> they are large , and are full , and are light .::::because
Small rooms are those which require <<target>> fittings and rich furniture .::::costly
Mrs. Proudie knew this , and made the most of it ; she had therefore <<target>> huge gas lamp with a dozen burners hanging from each of the ceilings .::::a
People were to arrive at ten , supper was to last from twelve <<target>> one , and at half-past one everybody was to be gone .::::till
Carriages were to come in at the gate in <<target>> town and depart at the gate outside .::::the
They were desired to take up <<target>> a quarter before one .::::at
It was managed excellently , <<target>> Mr. Slope was invaluable .::::and
At half-past nine the bishop and his wife and their three daughters entered <<target>> great reception-room , and very grand and very solemn they were .::::the
Mr. Slope was downstairs giving the <<target>> orders about the wine .::::last
He well understood that curates and country vicars with their belongings did <<target>> require so generous an article as the dignitaries of the close .::::not
There is a useful gradation in such <<target>> , and Marsala at 20s .::::things
a dozen did very well for the <<target>> supplementary tables in the corner .::::exterior
`` Bishop , '' said the lady , as his lordship sat himself down , `` do n't sit <<target>> that sofa , if you please ; it is to be kept separate for a lady . ''::::on
The bishop jumped up and seated <<target>> on a cane-bottomed chair .::::himself
he inquired meekly ; `` do you mean <<target>> particular lady , my dear ? ''::::one
said the bishop , <<target>> his eyes .::::opening
`` Nonsense , Netta , what stuff <<target>> talk , '' said Olivia .::::you
`` She has got legs , <<target>> she ca n't use them .::::but
She has always to be kept lying down , and <<target>> or four men carry her about everywhere . ''::::three
`` Laws , <<target>> odd ! ''::::how
`` Always carried about <<target>> four men !::::by
Am I right <<target>> , Mamma ?::::behind
I feel as if I was open ; '' <<target>> she turned her back to her anxious parent .::::and
`` But , '' rejoined the bishop , who was dying with curiosity about the mysterious <<target>> and her legs , `` who is it that is to have the sofa ?::::lady
A thundering rap at the <<target>> door interrupted the conversation .::::front
Mrs. Proudie stood up and shook herself gently , and touched <<target>> cap on each side as she looked in the mirror .::::her
Each of the girls stood on tiptoe and rearranged the bows on their <<target>> , and Mr. Slope rushed upstairs three steps at a time .::::bosoms
`` But who is <<target>> , Netta ? ''::::it
whispered the bishop to <<target>> youngest daughter .::::his
`` La Signora <<target>> Vicinironi ! ''::::madeline
muttered to himself <<target>> bewildered prelate .::::the
Had he been told that the Begum of Oude was to be there , or <<target>> Pomara of the Western Isles , he could not have been more astonished .::::queen
La Signora Madeline Vicinironi , who , having no legs to <<target>> on , had bespoken a sofa in his drawing-room !::::stand
They had been sent on out of the way a little before the time , in order <<target>> the signora might have plenty of time to get herself conveniently packed into the carriage .::::that
The bishop was all smiles for the prebendary 's wife , <<target>> the bishop 's wife was all smiles for the prebendary .::::and
Mr. Slope was presented and was delighted to make the <<target>> of one of whom he had heard so much .::::acquaintance
The doctor bowed very low , and then looked as though he could not return the <<target>> as regarded Mr. Slope , of whom , indeed , he had heard nothing .::::compliment
And then the guests came in shoals : Mr. <<target>> Mrs. Quiverful and their three grown daughters .::::and
Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick <<target>> their three daughters .::::and
The burly chancellor and his wife <<target>> clerical son from Oxford .::::and
The meagre little <<target>> without incumbrance .::::doctor
Mr. Harding with Eleanor <<target>> Miss Bold .::::and
The dean leaning on a gaunt spinster , his only child now living with him , a lady very <<target>> in stones , ferns , plants , and vermin , and who had written a book about petals .::::learned
A wonderful woman in her <<target>> was Miss Trefoil .::::way
Mr. Finnie , the attorney , with his wife , was to be seen , <<target>> to the dismay of many who had never met him in a drawing-room before .::::much
The five Barchester doctors were all there , and old Scalpen , the retired apothecary and tooth-drawer , who was <<target>> taught to consider himself as belonging to the higher orders by the receipt of the bishop 's card .::::first
Then came the archdeacon and his wife with their elder daughter Griselda , a slim , pale , retiring girl of seventeen who kept close to her <<target>> , and looked out on the world with quiet watchful eyes , one who gave promise of much beauty when time should have ripened it .::::mother
And so the rooms became full , and knots were formed , and every newcomer paid his respects to <<target>> lord and passed on , not presuming to occupy too much of the great man 's attention .::::my
The archdeacon shook hands very heartily with Dr. Stanhope , <<target>> Mrs. Grantly seated herself by the doctor 's wife .::::and
And Mrs. Proudie moved about with well-regulated grace , measuring out the quantity of her favours to <<target>> quality of her guests , just as Mr. Slope had been doing with the wine .::::the
But the sofa was still empty , and five-and-twenty ladies and five <<target>> had been courteously warned off it by the mindful chaplain .::::gentlemen
`` Why does n't <<target>> come ? ''::::she
said the bishop <<target>> himself .::::to
His mind was so preoccupied with the signora that <<target>> hardly remembered how to behave himself _en bishop_ .::::he
At last a carriage dashed up to the hall steps with a very different manner <<target>> approach from that of any other vehicle that had been there that evening .::::of
A perfect commotion <<target>> place .::::took
The doctor , who heard it as he was standing in the drawing-room , knew that his daughter <<target>> coming , and retired into the furthest corner , where he might not see her entrance .::::was
Mrs. Proudie perked herself up , feeling that <<target>> important piece of business was in hand .::::some
He was , however , nearly knocked down and trampled on <<target>> the cortÃ¨ge that he encountered on the hall steps .::::by
He got himself picked up , as well as <<target>> could , and followed the cortÃ¨ge upstairs .::::he
The signora was carried head foremost , her head being the care of her brother and an Italian manservant who was accustomed to the work ; her feet were in <<target>> care of the lady 's maid and the lady 's Italian page ; and Charlotte Stanhope followed to see that all was done with due grace and decorum .::::the
In this manner they climbed easily into the drawing-room , and a broad way <<target>> the crowd having been opened , the signora rested safely on her couch .::::through
She had sent a servant beforehand to learn whether it was a right- or a left-hand <<target>> , for it required that she should dress accordingly , particularly as regarded her bracelets .::::sofa
And very becoming <<target>> dress was .::::her
It was white velvet , without any other garniture than rich white lace worked with <<target>> across her bosom , and the same round the armlets of her dress .::::pearls
Across her brow she wore a band of red velvet , on the centre of which shone a magnificent Cupid in mosaic , <<target>> tints of whose wings were of the most lovely azure , and the colour of his chubby cheeks the clearest pink .::::the
On the one arm which her position required her to expose <<target>> wore three magnificent bracelets , each of different stones .::::she
Beneath her on the sofa , and over the cushion and head of it , was spread <<target>> crimson silk mantle or shawl , which went under her whole body and concealed her feet .::::a
Dressed as she was and looking as she did , so beautiful and yet so motionless , with the pure brilliancy of her white dress brought out and strengthened by the colour beneath <<target>> , with that lovely head , and those large , bold , bright , staring eyes , it was impossible that either man or woman should do other than look at her .::::it
Neither man nor woman for <<target>> minutes did do other .::::some
Her bearers too were <<target>> of note .::::worthy
The three servants were Italian , and though perhaps not peculiar in their <<target>> country , were very much so in the palace at Barchester .::::own
The man especially attracted notice and created a doubt in the <<target>> of some whether he were a friend or a domestic .::::mind
The same doubt was <<target>> as to Ethelbert .::::felt
He had a jaunty , fat , well-pleased , clean face on which no atom of <<target>> appeared , and he wore round his neck a loose , black silk neck-handkerchief .::::beard
The bishop essayed to make him a bow , but the man , who was well trained , took no notice <<target>> him and walked out of the room quite at his ease , followed by the woman and the boy .::::of
Ethelbert Stanhope was dressed in light <<target>> from head to foot .::::blue
He had on the loosest possible blue coat , cut <<target>> like a shooting coat , and very short .::::square
It was lined with <<target>> of azure blue .::::silk
He had on a blue satin waistcoat , a blue neck-handkerchief which was fastened beneath his <<target>> with a coral ring , and very loose blue trousers which almost concealed his feet .::::throat
His soft , glossy beard was <<target>> and more glossy than ever .::::softer
The bishop , who had made one mistake , thought that he also <<target>> a servant and therefore tried to make way for him to pass .::::was
But Ethelbert soon <<target>> the error .::::corrected
Mrs. Proudie 's <<target>> -- Concluded::::reception
We are in rather close quarters <<target>> , a'nt we ? ''::::here
They had been crowded up behind the head of the sofa -- the bishop in waiting to receive his <<target>> , and the other in carrying her -- and they now had hardly room to move themselves .::::guest
The bishop gave his hand quickly , made his little studied bow , and was delighted to make -- He could n't <<target>> on , for he did not know whether his friend was a signor , or a count or a prince .::::go
`` My sister really puts you all <<target>> great trouble , '' said Bertie .::::to
`` Not at <<target>> ! ''::::all
The bishop was delighted to have the opportunity of welcoming La Signora Vicinironi -- so at least <<target>> said -- and attempted to force his way round to the front of the sofa .::::he
He had , at any rate , learnt <<target>> his strange guests were brother and sister .::::that
The man , he presumed , must be Signor Vicinironi -- <<target>> count , or prince , as it might be .::::or
It was wonderful what <<target>> English he spoke .::::good
There was just a twang of <<target>> accent , and no more .::::foreign
The bishop , looking dignified , <<target>> that he did like Barchester .::::said
`` No -- not long , '' said the bishop and tried again to make his way between the back <<target>> the sofa and a heavy rector , who was staring over it at the grimaces of the signora .::::of
`` You were n't a bishop <<target>> , were you ? ''::::before
Dr. Proudie explained that this was <<target>> first diocese he had held .::::the
`` They 've cut them all down to pretty <<target>> the same figure , have n't they ? ''::::nearly
To this the bishop could not bring himself to make <<target>> answer , but again attempted to move the rector .::::any
`` But the work , I <<target>> , is different ? ''::::suppose
`` Is there much to do <<target>> , at Barchester ? ''::::here
This was said exactly in the tone that a young Admiralty clerk might <<target>> in asking the same question of a brother acolyte at the Treasury .::::use
The responsibility which he has to <<target>> is very great indeed . ''::::bear
said Bertie , opening wide <<target>> wonderful blue eyes .::::his
`` Well , I never <<target>> afraid of responsibility .::::was
I once had thoughts of being <<target>> bishop , myself . ''::::a
`` Had thoughts of <<target>> a bishop ! ''::::being
`` That is , a parson -- a parson <<target>> , you know , and a bishop afterwards .::::first
If I had once begun , <<target>> 'd have stuck to it .::::i
But , on the whole , I like <<target>> Church of Rome the best . ''::::the
The bishop could not discuss the <<target>> , so he remained silent .::::point
`` Now , there 's my father , '' continued <<target>> ; `` he has n't stuck to it .::::bertie
I fancy he did n't like saying <<target>> same thing over so often .::::the
By the by , Bishop , <<target>> you seen my father ? ''::::have
The bishop was more <<target>> than ever .::::amazed
Had he seen <<target>> father ?::::his
`` No , '' he replied ; he had not yet had the pleasure : he hoped he might ; and , as he <<target>> so , he resolved to bear heavy on that fat , immovable rector , if ever he had the power of doing so .::::said
`` He 's in the room somewhere , '' said <<target>> , `` and he 'll turn up soon .::::bertie
By the by , do you <<target>> much about the Jews ? ''::::know
At last the bishop <<target>> a way out .::::saw
`` I beg your pardon , '' said he , `` <<target>> I 'm forced to go round the room . ''::::but
`` Well -- I believe I 'll follow <<target>> your wake , '' said Bertie .::::in
`` Terribly hot -- <<target>> n't it ? ''::::is
This he addressed to the fat rector with whom <<target>> had brought himself into the closest contact .::::he
`` They 've got this sofa into the worst possible <<target>> of the room ; suppose we move it .::::part
Take care , <<target>> . ''::::madeline
The sofa had certainly been so placed that those who were behind it found great difficulty <<target>> getting out ; there was but a narrow gangway , which one person could stop .::::in
This was a bad arrangement , and one which <<target>> thought it might be well to improve .::::bertie
`` Take care , Madeline , '' said he , and turning to the <<target>> rector , added , `` Just help me with a slight push . ''::::fat
The rector 's weight was resting on the sofa and unwittingly lent all <<target>> impetus to accelerate and increase the motion which Bertie intentionally originated .::::its
Mrs. Proudie was standing with Mr. Slope in front of the signora , and had been trying to be condescending and sociable ; but she was not <<target>> the very best of tempers , for she found that , whenever she spoke to the lady , the lady replied by speaking to Mr. Slope .::::in
Mr. Slope was a favourite , no doubt , but Mrs. Proudie <<target>> no idea of being less thought of than the chaplain .::::had
She was beginning to be stately , stiff , and offended , when unfortunately the castor of the sofa <<target>> itself in her lace train , and carried away there is no saying how much of her garniture .::::caught
Gathers were heard to go , stitches to crack , plaits to fly open , flounces were seen to fall , and breadths to expose <<target>> ; a long ruin of rent lace disfigured the carpet , and still clung to the vile wheel on which the sofa moved .::::themselves
So , when a granite battery is raised , excellent to the <<target>> of warfaring men , is its strength and symmetry admired .::::eyes
It is the <<target>> of years .::::work
Its neat embrasures , its finished parapets , its <<target>> stories show all the skill of modern science .::::casemated
But , anon , a small spark is applied to the treacherous fusee -- a cloud of dust arises <<target>> the heavens -- and then nothing is to be seen but dirt and dust and ugly fragments .::::to
We know what was the wrath of <<target>> when her beauty was despised .::::juno
We know to what storms of <<target>> even celestial minds can yield .::::passion
As Juno may have looked at Paris on Mount Ida , so did Mrs. Proudie look <<target>> Ethelbert Stanhope when he pushed the leg of the sofa into her lace train .::::on
`` Oh , you <<target>> , Bertie ! ''::::idiot
said the signora , seeing what had been <<target>> and what were to be the consequences .::::done
re-echoed Mrs. Proudie , as though the word were not half strong enough to express the required meaning ; `` I 'll let him know -- '' and then <<target>> round to learn , at a glance , the worst , she saw that at present it behoved her to collect the scattered _dÃ©bris_ of her dress .::::looking
Bertie , when he saw what he had done , rushed over <<target>> sofa and threw himself on one knee before the offended lady .::::the
From what scrap of dramatic poetry she had extracted the word can not be said , but <<target>> must have rested on her memory , and now seemed opportunely dignified for the occasion .::::it
`` I 'll fly to the looms of the fairies to repair the damage , <<target>> you 'll only forgive me , '' said Ethelbert , still on his knees .::::if
This allusion to the fairies was a direct <<target>> and intended to turn her into ridicule .::::mockery
So at least it <<target>> to her .::::seemed
`` It 's not me ; it 's the cursed sofa , '' said Bertie , looking imploringly in her face and <<target>> up both his hands to show that he was not touching her belongings , but still remaining on his knees .::::holding
And as the tigress bereft of her young will turn with equal anger on <<target>> within reach , so did Mrs. Proudie turn upon her female guest .::::any
she said -- and it is beyond the power of prose <<target>> tell of the fire which flashed from her eyes .::::to
The signora stared her full in the face for a moment , and then turning <<target>> her brother said playfully , `` Bertie , you idiot , get up . ''::::to
By this time the bishop , and Mr. Slope , and her three daughters <<target>> around her , and had collected together the wide ruins of her magnificence .::::were
The girls fell into circular rank behind their mother , and thus following her and carrying <<target>> the fragments , they left the reception-rooms in a manner not altogether devoid of dignity .::::out
Mrs. Proudie had to <<target>> and re-array herself .::::retire
As soon as the constellation had swept by , Ethelbert rose from his knees and , turning with mock anger <<target>> the fat rector , said : `` After all it was your doing , sir -- not mine .::::to
Whereupon there was a laugh against the fat rector , in which both the <<target>> and the chaplain joined , and thus things got themselves again into order .::::bishop
`` My brother <<target>> so thoughtless .::::is
Pray sit down , and let me <<target>> the pleasure of making your acquaintance .::::have
Madeline could always dispose herself so as to make room for a gentleman , though , as <<target>> declared , the crinoline of her lady friends was much too bulky to be so accommodated .::::she
`` It was solely for the pleasure of meeting you that <<target>> have had myself dragged here , '' she continued .::::i
`` Of course , with your occupation , one can not even hope that you should <<target>> time to come to us , that is , in the way of calling .::::have
And at your English dinner-parties all <<target>> so dull and so stately .::::is
Do you know , my lord , that in coming to England my only consolation has been the thought <<target>> I should know you ; '' and she looked at him with the look of a she-devil .::::that
The bishop , however , thought that she looked very like an <<target>> and , accepting the proffered seat , sat down beside her .::::angel
He uttered some platitude as to his deep obligation for the trouble <<target>> had taken , and wondered more and more who she was .::::she
`` Of course you know <<target>> sad story ? ''::::my
The bishop did n't know <<target>> word of it .::::a
He knew , however , or thought he knew , that she could n't walk <<target>> a room like other people , and so made the most of that .::::into
He put on a look of ineffable distress and said <<target>> he was aware how God had afflicted her .::::that
The signora just touched the corner of her <<target>> with the most lovely of pocket-handkerchiefs .::::eyes
Yes , she said -- she had been sorely tried -- tried , she thought , beyond the <<target>> endurance of humanity ; but while her child was left to her , everything was left .::::common
my lord , '' she exclaimed , `` you must see that infant -- the last bud of a wondrous tree : you <<target>> let a mother hope that you will lay your holy hands on her innocent head and consecrate her for female virtues .::::must
May I hope <<target>> ? ''::::it
said she , looking into the bishop 's eye <<target>> touching the bishop 's arm with her hand .::::and
The bishop was but a <<target>> and said she might .::::man
After all , what was it but a request that he would confirm her daughter ? -- a request , indeed , very unnecessary <<target>> make , as he should do so as a matter of course if the young lady came forward in the usual way .::::to
`` The blood of Tiberius , '' said the signora in all but <<target>> whisper ; `` the blood of Tiberius flows in her veins .::::a
She is the last <<target>> the Neros ! ''::::of
The bishop had heard of the last of the Visigoths , and had floating in his brain some indistinct idea of the last <<target>> the Mohicans , but to have the last of the Neros thus brought before him for a blessing was very staggering .::::of
Still he liked the lady : she had a proper way <<target>> thinking and talked with more propriety than her brother .::::of
It was now quite clear that that blue madman <<target>> the silky beard was not a Prince Vicinironi .::::with
The lady was married and was of course one <<target>> the Vicinironi 's by right of the husband .::::of
So the bishop <<target>> on learning .::::went
`` When will <<target>> see her ?::::you
said the signora <<target>> a start .::::with
`` What is the young <<target>> 's age ? ''::::lady
`` But you might speak to her ; you might let her hear from your consecrated lips that she is not a castaway because she is a Roman ; that she may be a Nero and yet a Christian ; <<target>> she may owe her black locks and dark cheeks to the blood of the pagan Caesars , and yet herself be a child of grace ; you will tell her this , wo n't you , my friend ? ''::::that
The friend said he would , and asked <<target>> the child could say her catechism .::::if
`` No , '' said the signora , `` I would not allow her to learn lessons <<target>> as those in a land ridden over by priests and polluted by the idolatry of Rome .::::such
It is here , here in Barchester , that she <<target>> first be taught to lisp those holy words .::::must
Oh , that you could <<target>> her instructor ! ''::::be
Now , Dr. Proudie certainly liked the lady , but , seeing that he was a bishop , it was not probable that he <<target>> going to instruct a little girl in the first rudiments of her catechism ; so he said he 'd send a teacher .::::was
`` But you 'll see her <<target>> , my lord ? ''::::yourself
The bishop said he would , <<target>> where should he call .::::but
`` At Papa 's house , '' said the Signora <<target>> an air of some little surprise at the question .::::with
The bishop actually wanted the courage to ask her who was her papa , <<target>> he was forced at last to leave her without fathoming the mystery .::::so
Mrs. Proudie , in her second best , had now returned to the rooms , and her husband thought it as well <<target>> he should not remain in too close conversation with the lady whom his wife appeared to hold in such slight esteem .::::that
Presently he came across <<target>> youngest daughter .::::his
`` Netta , '' said he , `` do you <<target>> who is the father of that Signora Vicinironi ? ''::::know
But I must go and do the civil to Griselda Grantly ; I <<target>> nobody has spoken a word to the poor girl this evening . ''::::declare
Dr. Vesey Stanhope 's daughter , of whose marriage with a <<target>> Italian scamp he now remembered to have heard something !::::dissolute
And that impertinent blue cub who had examined him as to his episcopal bearings was old Stanhope 's son , <<target>> the lady who had entreated him to come and teach her child the catechism was old Stanhope 's daughter !::::and
The daughter of one <<target>> his own prebendaries !::::of
As these things flashed across his mind , he <<target>> nearly as angry as his wife had been .::::was
Nevertheless , he could not but own that the mother <<target>> the last of the Neros was an agreeable woman .::::of
Dr. Proudie tripped out into the adjoining room , in which were congregated a crowd of Grantlyite clergymen , among whom the <<target>> was standing pre-eminent , while the old dean was sitting nearly buried in a huge arm chair by the fire-place .::::archdeacon
The bishop was very anxious to be gracious , and , if <<target>> , to diminish the bitterness which his chaplain had occasioned .::::possible
Let Mr. Slope do the _fortiter in re_ , <<target>> himself would pour in the _suaviter in modo_ .::::he
`` Pray do n't stir , Mr. Dean , pray do n't stir , '' he said as the old man essayed <<target>> get up ; `` I take it as a great kindness , your coming to such an _omnium gatherum_ as this .::::to
But we have hardly got settled yet , and Mrs. Proudie has not <<target>> able to see her friends as she would wish to do .::::been
Well , Mr. Archdeacon , after all , we have <<target>> been so hard upon you at Oxford . ''::::not
`` No , '' said the archdeacon , `` you 've only drawn our teeth and <<target>> out our tongues ; you 've allowed us still to breathe and swallow . ''::::cut
laughed the bishop ; `` it 's not quite so easy to cut out the tongue <<target>> an Oxford magnate -- and as for teeth -- ha , ha , ha !::::of
Why , in the way we 've left the matter , it 's very odd if the heads of colleges do n't have <<target>> own way quite as fully as when the hebdomadal board was in all its glory ; what do you say , Mr .::::their
`` An old man , my lord , <<target>> likes changes , '' said the dean .::::never
At any rate , you must own this ; you have <<target>> done the half what you boasted you would do . ''::::not
`` Now , as regards your system of <<target>> -- '' began the chancellor slowly .::::professors
He was never destined to <<target>> beyond such beginning .::::get
The bishop , looking round , perceived that <<target>> abominable young Stanhope had pursued him .::::that
groaned out the chancellor , as though his nervous system had received <<target>> shock which nothing but a week of Oxford air could cure .::::a
`` Yes , '' continued Ethelbert , not at all understanding why a <<target>> professor should be contemptible in the eyes of an Oxford don .::::german
`` Not but what the name <<target>> best earned at Oxford .::::is
In Germany the professors do teach ; at Oxford , I believe , <<target>> only profess to do so , and sometimes not even that .::::they
You 'll have those universities of yours about your ears soon , <<target>> you do n't consent to take a lesson from Germany . ''::::if
There was no <<target>> this .::::answering
Dignified clergymen of sixty years of age could not condescend to discuss such <<target>> matter with a young man with such clothes and such a beard .::::a
`` Have you got good water <<target>> at Plumstead , Mr .::::out
said the bishop by way <<target>> changing the conversation .::::of
laughed the bishop , `` a good cellar of wine <<target>> a very comfortable thing in a house . ''::::is
`` Your German professors , Sir , prefer beer , <<target>> believe , '' said the sarcastic little meagre prebendary .::::i
`` They do n't think much of either , '' said <<target>> , `` and that perhaps accounts for their superiority .::::ethelbert
Now the Jewish <<target>> -- ''::::professor
The insult was becoming too deep for the spirit of Oxford to endure , so the archdeacon walked off one way and <<target>> chancellor another , followed by their disciples , and the bishop and the young reformer were left together on the hearth-rug .::::the
`` I was a Jew once <<target>> , '' began Bertie .::::myself
The bishop was determined not to stand another examination , or be led on any terms into Palestine , so <<target>> again remembered that he had to do something very particular , and left young Stanhope with the dean .::::he
The dean did not get the worst of it for Ethelbert gave <<target>> a true account of his remarkable doings in the Holy Land .::::him
You know , of course , that <<target>> is to be filled up . ''::::it
Mr. Harding 's heart beat a little , <<target>> he said that he had heard so .::::and
`` Of course , '' continued the bishop ; `` there can be <<target>> one man whom I could wish to see in that situation .::::only
I do n't know what your own <<target>> may be , Mr. Harding -- ''::::views
`` They are very simply told , my lord , '' said the other ; `` to take the place if <<target>> be offered me , and to put up with the want of it should another man get it . ''::::it
The bishop professed himself delighted to hear it ; Mr. Harding <<target>> be quite sure that no other man would get it .::::might
There were some few circumstances which would in a <<target>> degree change the nature of the duties .::::slight
Mr. Harding was probably aware of this , and would , <<target>> , not object to discuss the matter with Mr. Slope .::::perhaps
It was a subject to which Mr. Slope <<target>> given a good deal of attention .::::had
Mr. Harding felt , he knew <<target>> why , oppressed and annoyed .::::not
What could Mr. Slope <<target>> to him ?::::do
He knew that there <<target>> to be changes .::::were
'T was thus he tried to argue himself back <<target>> an easy mind , but in vain .::::to
Mr. Slope in the meantime had taken the seat which the bishop had vacated on the signora 's <<target>> , and remained with that lady till it was time to marshal the folk to supper .::::sofa
Was she not an intriguing Italian woman , half wife and <<target>> not , full of affectation , airs , and impudence ?::::half
Was she not horribly bedizened with velvet and pearls , with velvet and <<target>> , too , which had not been torn off her back ?::::pearls
Above all , did she not pretend <<target>> be more beautiful than her neighbours ?::::to
To say that Mrs. Proudie was jealous would <<target>> a wrong idea of her feelings .::::give
She had not the slightest desire that Mr. <<target>> should be in love with herself .::::slope
But she desired the incense of Mr. Slope 's spiritual and temporal services , and did not <<target>> that they should be turned out of their course to such an object as Signora Neroni .::::choose
She considered also that Mr. Slope ought in duty to hate the signora , <<target>> it appeared from his manner that he was very far from hating her .::::and
`` Come , Mr. Slope , '' she said , sweeping by and <<target>> all that she felt , `` ca n't you make yourself useful ?::::looking
Do pray take Mrs. Grantly <<target>> to supper . ''::::down
Mrs. Grantly heard <<target>> escaped .::::and
The words were hardly out of Mrs. Proudie 's mouth before the intended victim had stuck <<target>> hand through the arm of one of her husband 's curates and saved herself .::::her
What would the archdeacon have said had he <<target>> her walking downstairs with Mr. Slope ?::::seen
Mr. Slope heard also , but was by <<target>> means so obedient as was expected .::::no
Indeed , the period of Mr. Slope 's obedience <<target>> Mrs. Proudie was drawing to a close .::::to
He did not wish yet to break with her , nor to <<target>> with her at all , if it could be avoided .::::break
But he intended to be master in that palace , and as she had <<target>> the same resolution it was not improbable that they might come to blows .::::made
Before leaving the signora he arranged a little table before <<target>> and begged to know what he should bring her .::::her
She was quite indifferent , she <<target>> -- nothing -- anything .::::said
It was now she felt the misery of her <<target>> , now that she must be left alone .::::position
Well , a little chicken , some <<target>> , and a glass of champagne .::::ham
Mr. Slope had to explain , not without blushing <<target>> his patron , that there was no champagne .::::for
Sherry would do <<target>> as well .::::just
And then Mr. Slope descended with the <<target>> Miss Trefoil on his arm .::::learned
Could she tell him , he asked , whether the <<target>> of Barsetshire were equal to those of Cumberland ?::::ferns
His strongest worldly passion was for ferns -- and before she could <<target>> him he left her wedged between the door and the sideboard .::::answer
It was fifty minutes before she <<target>> , and even then unfed .::::escaped
`` You are not leaving us , Mr. Slope , '' said the watchful lady of the house , seeing <<target>> slave escaping towards the door , with stores of provisions held high above the heads of the guests .::::her
Mr. Slope explained that the Signora Neroni <<target>> in want of her supper .::::was
`` Pray , Mr. Slope , let her brother take it <<target>> her , '' said Mrs. Proudie , quite out loud .::::to
`` It is out of the question <<target>> you should be so employed .::::that
Pray , Mr. Slope , oblige me ; I am <<target>> Mr. Stanhope will wait upon his sister . ''::::sure
Ethelbert was most agreeably occupied in the furthest corner of the room , <<target>> himself both useful and agreeable to Mrs. Proudie 's youngest daughter .::::making
The lady 's anger was increased by seeing that her daughter also had gone over to the enemy , and when she saw , that in spite of her remonstrances , <<target>> the teeth of her positive orders , Mr. Slope went off to the drawing-room , the cup of her indignation ran over , and she could not restrain herself .::::in
`` I can not and will not permit it ; '' and then , after fussing and <<target>> for a few minutes , she pushed her way through the crowd and followed Mr. Slope .::::fuming
When she reached the room above , she found <<target>> absolutely deserted , except by the guilty pair .::::it
They had been discussing the merits of Sabbath-day schools , and the lady had suggested that as she could not possibly go <<target>> the children , she might be indulged in the wish of her heart by having the children brought to her .::::to
`` And when shall <<target>> be , Mr .::::it
Mr. Slope was saved the necessity of committing himself <<target>> a promise by the entry of Mrs. Proudie .::::to
She swept close up to the sofa so as to confront the guilty pair , stared full at them for a moment , and then said , as she passed on <<target>> the next room , `` Mr. Slope , his lordship is especially desirous of your attendance below ; you will greatly oblige me if you will join him . ''::::to
And so she <<target>> on .::::stalked
As for the bishop 's wanting him , he knew his lady patroness well enough to take that assertion at what it was worth ; <<target>> he did not wish to make himself the hero of a scene , or to become conspicuous for more gallantry than the occasion required .::::but
`` Is she always <<target>> this ? ''::::like
`` Yes -- always -- madam , '' said Mrs. Proudie , returning ; `` always the same -- always equally adverse to impropriety <<target>> conduct of every description ; '' and she stalked back through the room again , following Mr. Slope out of the door .::::of
The signora could n't follow her , <<target>> she certainly would have done so .::::or
But she laughed loud , and sent the sound of it ringing <<target>> the lobby and down the stairs after Mrs. Proudie 's feet .::::through
Had she been as active as Grimaldi , <<target>> could probably have taken no better revenge .::::she
`` Mr. Slope , '' said Mrs. Proudie , catching the delinquent at the door , `` I <<target>> surprised you should leave my company to attend on such a painted Jezebel as that . ''::::am
`` But she 's lame , Mrs. <<target>> , and can not move .::::proudie
Somebody must have waited <<target>> her . ''::::upon
`` Lame , '' said Mrs. Proudie ; `` <<target>> 'd lame her if she belonged to me .::::i
In the hall and adjacent rooms all manner of cloaking and shawling <<target>> going on , and the Barchester folk were getting themselves gone .::::was
Mrs. Proudie did her best to smirk at each and every one <<target>> they made their adieux , but she was hardly successful .::::as
Her temper had <<target>> tried fearfully .::::been
By slow degrees <<target>> guests went .::::the
The younger Stanhopes were left to the very last , and <<target>> uncomfortable party they made with the bishop 's family .::::an
They all went into the dining-room , and then the bishop observing that `` <<target>> lady '' was alone in the drawing-room , they followed him up .::::the
Mrs. Proudie kept Mr. Slope and her daughters in close conversation , <<target>> that he should not be indulged , nor they polluted .::::resolving
The bishop , in mortal dread of Bertie and the Jews , <<target>> to converse with Charlotte Stanhope about the climate of Italy .::::tried
Bertie and the signora had no <<target>> but in each other .::::resource
`` Did you get your supper <<target>> last , Madeline ? ''::::at
said the impudent or <<target>> mischievous young man .::::else
`` Oh , yes , '' said Madeline ; `` Mr. <<target>> was so very kind as to bring it me .::::slope
I fear , however , he put himself <<target>> more inconvenience than I wished . ''::::to
Mrs. Proudie looked at <<target>> but said nothing .::::her
The meaning of her look might have been thus translated ; `` If ever you find yourself within these walls <<target>> , I 'll give you leave to be as impudent and affected and as mischievous as you please . ''::::again
At last the carriage returned with the three Italian servants , and La Signora <<target>> Vesey Neroni was carried out , as she had been carried in .::::madeline
The lady of the palace retired to her chamber by no means <<target>> with the result of her first grand party at Barchester .::::contented
Two or three days after the party , Mr. Harding received a note begging him to call <<target>> Mr. Slope , at the palace , at an early hour on the following morning .::::on
There was nothing uncivil in the communication , and <<target>> the tone of it was thoroughly displeasing .::::yet
Will you favour me by calling on me <<target>> the palace to-morrow morning at 9:30 A.M .::::at
The bishop wishes me to speak <<target>> you touching the hospital .::::to
I hope you will excuse my <<target>> so early an hour .::::naming
I do so as my <<target>> is greatly occupied .::::time
If , however , it is positively inconvenient to <<target>> , I will change it to 10 .::::you
You will , perhaps , be kind enough <<target>> let me have a note in reply .::::to
Believe me to be , My dear Mr. <<target>> , Your assured friend , OBH .::::harding
Mr. Harding neither could nor would believe anything of the sort , and he thought , <<target>> , that Mr. Slope was rather impertinent to call himself by such a name .::::moreover
How many assured friends generally fall to the <<target>> of a man in this world ?::::lot
And by what process <<target>> they made ?::::are
And how much of such process had taken place <<target>> yet between Mr. Harding and Mr. Slope ?::::as
Mr. Harding could not help asking himself these questions <<target>> he read and re-read the note before him .::::as
He answered it , <<target>> , as follows :::::however
I will call at the palace to-morrow <<target>> 9:30 A.M. as you desire .::::at
High Street , <<target>> , Monday::::barchester
And on the following morning , punctually at half-past nine , <<target>> knocked at the palace door and asked for Mr. Slope .::::he
The bishop had one small room allotted to him <<target>> the ground-floor , and Mr. Slope had another .::::on
Into this latter Mr. Harding was <<target>> and asked to sit down .::::shown
Mr. Slope was <<target>> yet there .::::not
The ex-warden stood up at the window looking into the garden , and could not help thinking how very short a time had passed since the <<target>> of that house had been open to him , as though he had been a child of the family , born and bred in it .::::whole
He remembered how the old servants used to smile as they opened the door to him ; how the familiar butler would say , when he had been absent a few hours longer than usual , `` A <<target>> of you , Mr. Harding , is good for sore eyes ; '' how the fussy housekeeper would swear that he could n't have dined , or could n't have breakfasted , or could n't have lunched .::::sight
And then , above all , he remembered the pleasant gleam of inward satisfaction which <<target>> spread itself over the old bishop 's face whenever his friend entered his room .::::always
A tear came into each eye as <<target>> reflected that all this was gone .::::he
What use would the hospital <<target>> to him now ?::::be
He was alone in the world , and getting old ; he would soon , very soon have to go and leave it all , as his dear old friend <<target>> gone ; go , and leave the hospital , and his accustomed place in the cathedral , and his haunts and pleasures , to younger and perhaps wiser men .::::had
Perhaps , in truth , the <<target>> for it was gone by .::::time
He felt as though the world were sinking from his feet ; as though this , this was the <<target>> for him to turn with confidence to those hopes which he had preached with confidence to others .::::time
`` What , '' said he to himself , `` can a man 's religion be <<target>> if it does not support him against the natural melancholy of declining years ? ''::::worth
And as he looked out through his dimmed eyes into the bright parterres of the <<target>> 's garden , he felt that he had the support which he wanted .::::bishop
Nevertheless , he did not like <<target>> be thus kept waiting .::::to
If Mr. Slope did not really wish to see him at half-past nine o'clock , <<target>> force him to come away from his lodgings with his breakfast in his throat ?::::why
To tell the truth , it was <<target>> on the part of Mr. Slope .::::policy
Mr. Slope had made up his mind that Mr. Harding should either accept the hospital with abject submission , or else refuse it altogether , and had <<target>> that he would probably be more quick to do the latter , if he could be got to enter upon the subject in an ill-humour .::::calculated
Perhaps Mr. Slope was not <<target>> wrong in his calculation .::::altogether
It was nearly ten when Mr. Slope hurried into the room and , muttering something about the <<target>> and diocesan duties , shook Mr. Harding 's hand ruthlessly and begged him to be seated .::::bishop
Now the air of superiority which this man assumed did go against the grain <<target>> Mr. Harding , and yet he did not know how to resent it .::::with
The whole tendency of his mind and disposition was opposed to any contra-assumption of grandeur on his own part , and he had n't <<target>> worldly spirit or quickness necessary to put down insolent pretensions by downright and open rebuke , as the archdeacon would have done .::::the
There was nothing for Mr. Harding but to <<target>> , and he accordingly did so .::::submit
`` About the <<target>> , Mr .::::hospital
began Mr. Slope , speaking of it as the head of a college <<target>> Cambridge might speak of some sizarship which had to be disposed of .::::at
Mr. Harding crossed one leg over another , and then one hand over the other on the <<target>> of them , and looked Mr. Slope in the face ; but he said nothing .::::top
`` It 's to be filled up <<target>> , '' said Mr. Slope .::::again
Mr. Harding said that <<target>> had understood so .::::he
`` Of course , you know , the income will <<target>> very much reduced , '' continued Mr. Slope .::::be
`` The bishop wished to be liberal , and he therefore told the government <<target>> he thought it ought to be put at not less than Â£450 .::::that
I think on the whole the bishop was right , for though the services required will not <<target>> of a very onerous nature , they will be more so than they were before .::::be
And it is , perhaps , well that the clergy immediately attached to the cathedral town should <<target>> made as comfortable as the extent of the ecclesiastical means at our disposal will allow .::::be
Those are the bishop 's ideas , <<target>> I must say mine also . ''::::and
Mr. Harding sat rubbing one hand on the <<target>> , but said not a word .::::other
`` So much for the <<target>> , Mr. Harding .::::income
The house will , of course , <<target>> to the warden , as before .::::remain
It should , however , I think , be stipulated that he should paint inside every seven years , and outside <<target>> three years , and be subject to dilapidations , in the event of vacating , either by death or otherwise .::::every
But this is a matter on which <<target>> bishop must yet be consulted . ''::::the
`` Then , as to the duties , '' continued he , `` I believe , if I am rightly informed , there can hardly be said to <<target>> been any duties hitherto , '' and he gave a sort of half-laugh , as though to pass off the accusation in the guise of a pleasantry .::::have
Mr. Harding thought of the happy , easy years he had passed in his old home ; of the worn-out , aged men <<target>> he had succoured ; of his good intentions ; and of his work , which had certainly been of the lightest .::::whom
He thought of these things , doubting for a moment <<target>> he did or did not deserve the sarcasm .::::whether
He gave his enemy the benefit of the <<target>> , and did not rebuke him .::::doubt
Mr. Slope again smiled , and this time the smile was intended to operate against the memory of the <<target>> bishop rather than against the energy of the ex-warden ; so it was understood by Mr. Harding .::::late
The colour rose to his cheeks , <<target>> he began to feel very angry .::::and
`` You must be aware , Mr. Harding , that things are <<target>> good deal changed in Barchester , '' said Mr. Slope .::::a
Mr. Harding said that he <<target>> aware of it .::::was
`` And not only in Barchester , Mr. <<target>> , but in the world at large .::::harding
It is not only in Barchester that a new man is carrying <<target>> new measures and casting away the useless rubbish of past centuries .::::out
The same thing is going <<target>> throughout the country .::::on
Work is now required from every man who receives wages , and they who have to superintend the doing <<target>> work , and the paying of wages , are bound to see that this rule is carried out .::::of
New men , Mr. Harding , are now needed and are now <<target>> in the church , as well as in other professions . ''::::forthcoming
All this was wormwood <<target>> our old friend .::::to
He had never rated very high his own abilities or activity , but all the feelings of his heart were with the old clergy , and any antipathies <<target>> which his heart was susceptible were directed against those new , busy , uncharitable , self-lauding men , of whom Mr. Slope was so good an example .::::of
`` Perhaps , '' said he , `` the bishop <<target>> prefer a new man at the hospital ? ''::::will
`` The bishop is very anxious that you should accept the appointment , <<target>> he wishes you should understand beforehand what will be the required duties .::::but
In the first place , a Sabbath-day school <<target>> be attached to the hospital . ''::::will

`` No , Mr. Harding , not for the old men , but for the <<target>> of the children of such of the poor of Barchester as it may suit .::::benefit
The bishop will expect that you shall attend this school , and <<target>> the teachers shall be under your inspection and care . ''::::that
Mr. Harding slipped his topmost hand off the other and began <<target>> rub the calf of the leg which was supported .::::to
`` As to the old men , '' continued Mr. Slope , `` and the old women who are to form a part of the hospital , the bishop is desirous that you shall have morning and evening <<target>> on the premises every Sabbath , and one weekday service ; that you shall preach to them once at least on Sundays ; and that the whole hospital be always collected for morning and evening prayer .::::service
The bishop thinks that this will render it unnecessary that any separate <<target>> in the cathedral should be reserved for the hospital inmates . ''::::seats
`` Indeed , it would be difficult to find seats for the women ; on the whole , Mr. Harding , I may as well say at once , <<target>> for people of that class the cathedral service does not appear to me the most useful -- even if it be so for any class of people . ''::::that
`` We will not discuss that , if <<target>> please , '' said Mr. Harding .::::you
`` I am not desirous of doing so ; <<target>> least , not at the present moment .::::at
I hope , however , you fully understand the bishop 's wishes about the new establishment of the hospital ; and if , as I do not doubt , I shall receive from you <<target>> assurance that you accord with his lordship 's views , it will give me very great pleasure to be the bearer from his lordship to you of the presentation to the appointment . ''::::an
`` But if I disagree with <<target>> lordship 's views ? ''::::his
`` But I hope you do <<target>> , '' said Mr. Slope .::::not
`` But if <<target>> do ? ''::::i
`` If such unfortunately should be the case , which I can hardly conceive , I <<target>> your own feelings will dictate to you the propriety of declining the appointment . ''::::presume
`` But if I accept the appointment and yet <<target>> with the bishop , what then ? ''::::disagree
This question rather <<target>> Mr. Slope .::::bothered
It was true that he had talked the matter over with the bishop and had received a sort of authority for suggesting to Mr. Harding the propriety of <<target>> Sunday school and certain hospital services , but he had no authority for saying that these propositions were to be made peremptory conditions attached to the appointment .::::a
The bishop 's idea had been that Mr. Harding would of course consent and that the school would become , <<target>> the rest of those new establishments in the city , under the control of his wife and his chaplain .::::like
Mr. Slope 's idea <<target>> been more correct .::::had
He intended that Mr. Harding should refuse the situation , and that an ally of his own should get it , <<target>> he had not conceived the possibility of Mr. Harding openly accepting the appointment and as openly rejecting the conditions .::::but
`` It is not , I presume , probable , '' said he , `` that you will accept from the <<target>> of the bishop a piece of preferment with a fixed predetermination to disacknowledge the duties attached to it . ''::::hands
`` If I become warden , '' said Mr. Harding , `` and neglect my <<target>> , the bishop has means by which he can remedy the grievance . ''::::duty
`` I hardly expected such an argument from you , or I may say the suggestion of <<target>> a line of conduct , '' said Mr. Slope with a great look of injured virtue .::::such
`` Nor did I expect <<target>> a proposition . ''::::such
`` I shall be glad at any rate to know what answer <<target>> am to make to his lordship , '' said Mr. Slope .::::i
`` I will take an early opportunity of seeing <<target>> lordship myself , '' said Mr. Harding .::::his
Indeed , it is impossible that the bishop should himself see every <<target>> in the diocese on every subject of patronage that may arise .::::clergyman
The bishop , I believe , did see you on the matter , and I <<target>> can not see why he should be troubled to do so again . ''::::really
`` Do you know , Mr. Slope , how long I <<target>> been officiating as a clergyman in this city ? ''::::have
Mr. Slope 's wish <<target>> now nearly fulfilled .::::was
Mr. Harding had become angry , and it <<target>> probable that he might commit himself .::::was
`` I really do not see what <<target>> has to do with the question .::::that
You can not think the bishop would be justified in allowing you to regard as a sinecure a situation <<target>> requires an active , man merely because you have been employed for many years in the cathedral . ''::::that
`` But it might induce the bishop to see <<target>> , if I asked him to do so .::::me
He considered himself at liberty to accept Mr. Harding 's <<target>> speech as an absolute refusal of the appointment .::::last
At least , he so represented it <<target>> the bishop and to Mrs. Proudie .::::to
`` Not at all , '' said Mrs. Proudie ; `` you little know <<target>> determined the whole set of them are to withstand your authority . ''::::how
`` But Mr. Harding was so anxious <<target>> it , '' said the bishop .::::for
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Slope , `` if he can <<target>> it without the slightest acknowledgement of your lordship 's jurisdiction . ''::::hold
`` That is out of the <<target>> , '' said the bishop .::::question
`` I should imagine it to be <<target>> so , '' said the chaplain .::::quite
`` Indeed , I should think <<target>> , '' said the lady .::::so
`` I really am sorry for <<target>> , '' said the bishop .::::it
`` I do n't know that there is much <<target>> for sorrow , '' said the lady .::::cause
`` Mr. Quiverful is a much more deserving man , more in need of it , and <<target>> who will make himself much more useful in the close neighbourhood of the palace . ''::::one
`` I suppose I had <<target>> see Quiverful ? ''::::better
Mr. Harding was not a happy man as he walked <<target>> the palace pathway and stepped out into the close .::::down
His preferment and pleasant house were a second time <<target>> from him , but that he could endure .::::gone
He had been schooled and insulted by a man young enough to <<target>> his son , but that he could put up with .::::be
He could even draw from the very injuries which had been inflicted on him some of that consolation which we may believe martyrs always receive from <<target>> injustice of their own sufferings , and which is generally proportioned in its strength to the extent of cruelty with which martyrs are treated .::::the
He had admitted to his daughter that he wanted the comfort of his old home , and yet he could have returned <<target>> his lodgings in the High Street , if not with exaltation , at least with satisfaction , had that been all .::::to
But the venom of the chaplain 's harangue had worked into <<target>> blood , and sapped the life of his sweet contentment .::::his
`` New men are carrying out new measures and are <<target>> away the useless rubbish of past centuries ! ''::::carting
What cruel words these had been ; and how often are <<target>> now used with all the heartless cruelty of a Slope !::::they
A man is sufficiently condemned if it can only be shown that either in politics or <<target>> he does not belong to some new school established within the last score of years .::::religion
He may then regard himself as rubbish <<target>> expect to be carted away .::::and
A man is nothing now unless he has within him a full appreciation of the new era , an era in which <<target>> would seem that neither honesty nor truth is very desirable , but in which success is the only touchstone of merit .::::it
We must laugh at <<target>> that is established .::::everything
Let the joke be ever so bad , ever so untrue to the real <<target>> of joking ; nevertheless we must laugh -- or else beware the cart .::::principles
We must talk , think , and live up to the spirit of the times , and write <<target>> to it too , if that cacoethes be upon us , or else we are nought .::::up
New men and new measures , long credit and few scruples , great success or <<target>> ruin , such are now the tastes of Englishmen who know how to live .::::wonderful
Under such circumstances Mr. Harding could not but feel that he <<target>> an Englishman who did not know how to live .::::was
This new doctrine of Mr. Slope and the rubbish cart , <<target>> at least at Barchester , sadly disturbed his equanimity .::::new
`` The same thing is going <<target>> throughout the whole country !::::on
Work is now required from every <<target>> who receives wages ! ''::::man
And had he been living all his <<target>> receiving wages and doing no work ?::::life
Had he in truth so lived as to be now in his old age <<target>> reckoned as rubbish fit only to be hidden away in some huge dust-hole ?::::justly
The school of men to whom he professes to belong , the Grantlys , the Gwynnes , and the <<target>> high set of Oxford divines , are afflicted with no such self-accusations as these which troubled Mr. Harding .::::old
They , as a rule , are as satisfied with the wisdom and propriety of their own <<target>> as can be any Mr. Slope , or any Dr. Proudie , with his own .::::conduct
But unfortunately for himself Mr. Harding <<target>> little of this self-reliance .::::had
When he heard himself designated as rubbish by the Slopes of the world , he had no <<target>> resource than to make inquiry within his own bosom as to the truth of the designation .::::other
The evidence seemed generally <<target>> go against him .::::to
He had professed to himself in the bishop 's parlour that in these coming sources of the sorrow of age , in these <<target>> of sad regret from which the latter years of few reflecting men can be free , religion would suffice to comfort him .::::fits
Yes , religion could console him for the loss of any worldly good , but was his religion of that active sort which would enable <<target>> so to repent of misspent years as to pass those that were left to him in a spirit of hope for the future ?::::him
And such repentance itself , is it not <<target>> work of agony and of tears ?::::a
It is very easy to talk of repentance , but a man has to walk over hot ploughshares before he can complete it ; to be skinned <<target>> as was St. Bartholomew ; to be stuck full of arrows as was St. Sebastian ; to lie broiling on a gridiron like St. Lorenzo !::::alive
How if his past life <<target>> such repentance as this ?::::required
Had he the energy to <<target>> through with it ?::::go
Mr. Harding , after leaving the palace , walked slowly for an hour or so beneath <<target>> shady elms of the close and then betook himself to his daughter 's house .::::the
He had at any rate made up his mind that he would go out to Plumstead to <<target>> Dr. Grantly , and that he would in the first instance tell Eleanor what had occurred .::::consult
And now he was doomed <<target>> undergo another misery .::::to
Mr. Slope had forestalled him <<target>> the widow 's house .::::at
He had called there <<target>> the preceding afternoon .::::on
He could not , he had said , <<target>> himself the pleasure of telling Mrs .::::deny
Bold that her father was about to return <<target>> the pretty house at Hiram 's Hospital .::::to
He had been instructed by the bishop to inform Mr. <<target>> that the appointment would now be made at once .::::harding
The bishop was of course only too happy to be able to be the <<target>> of restoring to Mr. Harding the preferment which he had so long adorned .::::means
And then by degrees Mr. Slope had introduced the subject of the pretty <<target>> which he hoped before long to see attached to the hospital .::::school
He had quite <<target>> Mrs .::::fascinated
Bold by his description of this picturesque , useful , and charitable appendage , and she had gone so far as <<target>> say that she had no doubt her father would approve , and that she herself would gladly undertake a class .::::to
Anyone who had heard the entirely different tone and seen the entirely different manner in which Mr. Slope had spoken of this projected <<target>> to the daughter and to the father could not have failed to own that Mr. Slope was a man of genius .::::institution
He said nothing <<target>> Mrs .::::to
Bold about the hospital sermons and services , nothing about the exclusion of the old men <<target>> the cathedral , nothing about dilapidation and painting , nothing about carting away the rubbish .::::from
Eleanor had said to herself that certainly she did not like Mr. Slope personally , but that <<target>> was a very active , zealous clergyman and would no doubt be useful in Barchester .::::he
All this paved the way for <<target>> additional misery to Mr. Harding .::::much
Eleanor put on her happiest face as she heard her father on the stairs , for she thought she had only <<target>> congratulate him ; but directly she saw his face she knew that there was but little matter for congratulation .::::to
She had seen him with the same weary look of sorrow <<target>> one or two occasions before , and remembered it well .::::on
She had seen him when he first read that attack upon himself in `` The Jupiter '' which had ultimately caused him to resign the <<target>> , and she had seen him also when the archdeacon had persuaded him to remain there against his own sense of propriety and honour .::::hospital
She knew at a glance that <<target>> spirit was in deep trouble .::::his
`` Oh , Papa , <<target>> is it ? ''::::what
said she , putting down her <<target>> to crawl upon the floor .::::boy
`` I came to tell you , my dear , '' said he , `` that I <<target>> going out to Plumstead : you wo n't come with me , I suppose ? ''::::am
Shall you stay <<target>> ? ''::::there
`` I suppose I shall , to-night : I <<target>> consult the archdeacon about this weary hospital .::::must
I wish I had never <<target>> of it again . ''::::thought
`` Why , Papa , <<target>> is the matter ? ''::::what
Eleanor gave a sort of half-blush , but she was wrong if she imagined <<target>> her father in any way alluded to her acquaintance with Mr. Slope .::::that
`` Well , <<target>> . ''::::papa
`` He wants to turn the hospital into a Sunday-school and <<target>> preaching-house , and I suppose he will have his way .::::a
I do not feel myself adapted for such an establishment , and <<target>> , I suppose , I must refuse the appointment . ''::::therefore
`` What would be the harm <<target>> the school , Papa ? ''::::of
`` The want of a proper <<target>> , my dear . ''::::schoolmaster
`` But that would of <<target>> be supplied . ''::::course
`` Mr. Slope wishes to supply <<target>> by making me his schoolmaster .::::it
But as I am hardly fit for such <<target>> , I intend to decline . ''::::work
He was here yesterday , <<target>> what he intends -- ''::::and
`` Yes , <<target>> . ''::::papa
`` And talking about <<target>> hospital ? ''::::the
`` He was saying how glad he would be , and <<target>> bishop too , to see you back there again .::::the
And then he spoke about the Sunday-school ; and to tell the truth I <<target>> with him ; and I thought you would have done so too .::::agreed
Mr. Slope spoke of a school , not inside the hospital , but just connected with it , of which you would be the patron and visitor ; and I thought <<target>> would have liked such a school as that ; and I promised to look after it and to take a class -- and it all seemed so very -- .::::you
`` Nothing wrong at all , my dear , '' said <<target>> gently , very gently rejecting his daughter 's caress .::::he
`` There can be nothing wrong in your wishing to make yourself <<target>> ; indeed , you ought to do so by all means .::::useful
Everyone must now exert himself who would not <<target>> to go to the wall . ''::::choose
Poor Mr. Harding thus attempted in his misery <<target>> preach the new doctrine to his child .::::to
`` Himself or herself , it 's all the same , '' he continued ; `` you <<target>> be quite right , my dear , to do something of this sort ; but -- ''::::will
`` Well , <<target>> . ''::::papa
`` I am not quite sure that if I were <<target>> I would select Mr. Slope for my guide . ''::::you
`` But I never have done <<target>> and never shall . ''::::so
`` It would be very wicked of me to speak evil of him , for to tell the <<target>> I know no evil of him ; but I am not quite sure that he is honest .::::truth
`` I never thought of taking him <<target>> my guide , Papa . ''::::for
`` As for myself , my dear , '' continued he , `` we <<target>> the old proverb -- 'It 's bad teaching an old dog tricks . '::::know
I must decline the Sunday-school , and <<target>> therefore probably decline the hospital also .::::shall
But I will first <<target>> your brother-in-law . ''::::see
So he took up his hat , kissed the baby , <<target>> withdrew , leaving Eleanor in as low spirits as himself .::::and
All this was a great <<target>> to his misery .::::aggravation
He had so few with whom to sympathize that he could not afford to be <<target>> off from the one whose sympathy was of the most value to him .::::cut
And yet it seemed probable that <<target>> would be the case .::::this
He did not own to himself that he wished his daughter to hate Mr. Slope , yet had she expressed such a feeling <<target>> would have been very little bitterness in the rebuke he would have given her for so uncharitable a state of mind .::::there
The fact , however , was that she was on friendly terms with Mr. Slope , that she coincided <<target>> his views , adhered at once to his plans , and listened with delight to his teaching .::::with
Mr. Harding hardly wished his daughter to hate the man , <<target>> he would have preferred that to her loving him .::::but
He walked away to the inn to order a fly , went <<target>> to put up his carpet-bag , and then started for Plumstead .::::home
There was , at any rate , no danger that the archdeacon would fraternize with Mr. Slope ; but then <<target>> would recommend internecine war , public appeals , loud reproaches , and all the paraphernalia of open battle .::::he
When Mr. Harding reached the parsonage , he found that the archdeacon was out , and <<target>> not be home till dinnertime , so he began his complaint to his elder daughter .::::would
Mrs. Grantly entertained quite as strong an antagonism to Mr. Slope as did her husband ; she was also quite as alive to the necessity of combating the Proudie faction , of supporting the old church interest of the <<target>> , of keeping in her own set such of the loaves and fishes as duly belonged to it ; and was quite as well prepared as her lord to carry on the battle without giving or taking quarter .::::close
Not that she was a woman prone to quarrelling , or ill-inclined to live at peace with her clerical neighbours ; but she felt , as did the archdeacon , that the <<target>> of Mr. Slope in Barchester was an insult to everyone connected with the late bishop , and that his assumed dominion in the diocese was a spiritual injury to her husband .::::presence
Hitherto people had little guessed how <<target>> Mrs. Grantly could be .::::bitter
She lived on the best of terms with <<target>> the rectors ' wives around her .::::all
She had been popular with all <<target>> ladies connected with the close .::::the
Though much the wealthiest of the ecclesiastical matrons of the county , she had <<target>> managed her affairs that her carriage and horses had given umbrage to none .::::so
She had never thrown herself among the county grandees so <<target>> to excite the envy of other clergymen 's wives .::::as
She never talked too loudly of earls and countesses , or boasted that <<target>> gave her governess sixty pounds a year , or her cook seventy .::::she
Mrs. Grantly had lived the life of a wise , discreet , peace-making woman , and the people of <<target>> were surprised at the amount of military vigour she displayed as general of the feminine Grantlyite forces .::::barchester
Mrs. Grantly soon learned that her sister Eleanor had promised to assist Mr. Slope in the affairs <<target>> the hospital school , and it was on this point that her attention first fixed itself .::::of
`` How can Eleanor <<target>> him ? ''::::endure
`` He is a very crafty man , '' said her father , `` and his craft <<target>> been successful in making Eleanor think that he is a meek , charitable , good clergyman .::::has
God forgive me , if I wrong him , but <<target>> is not his true character in my opinion . ''::::such
said she , with something approaching <<target>> for her father 's moderation .::::scorn
`` I only hope he wo n't have craft enough <<target>> make Eleanor forget herself and her position . ''::::to
`` Do you mean <<target>> him ? ''::::marry
said he , startled out of his usual demeanour by <<target>> abruptness and horror of so dreadful a proposition .::::the
`` What is there <<target>> improbable in it ?::::so
Of course that would be his own object if <<target>> thought he had any chance of success .::::he
Eleanor has a thousand a year entirely at her own disposal , and what better fortune could fall <<target>> Mr. Slope 's lot than the transferring of the disposal of such a fortune to himself ? ''::::to
`` But you ca n't think <<target>> likes him , Susan ? ''::::she
`` Why should n't <<target>> like him ?::::she
`` Look after <<target>> ! ''::::her
`` Ah , Papa , <<target>> innocent you are !::::how
Of course it was to be <<target>> that Eleanor should marry again .::::expected
I should be the last to advise her against it , if she would <<target>> wait the proper time , and then marry at least a gentleman . ''::::only
`` But you do n't really mean to say that <<target>> suppose Eleanor has ever thought of marrying Mr. Slope ?::::you
Bold has only been <<target>> a year . ''::::dead
`` But I do n't suppose <<target>> has ever thought about it .::::eleanor
It is very probable , though , that he has ; and that he will try and make her do <<target>> ; and that he will succeed too , if we do n't take care what we are about . ''::::so
This was quite a new phase of <<target>> affair to poor Mr. Harding .::::the
To have thrust upon him as his son-in-law , as the husband of his favourite child , the only man in the <<target>> whom he really positively disliked , would be a misfortune which he felt he would not know how to endure patiently .::::world
But then , could there be any <<target>> for so dreadful a surmise ?::::ground
In all worldly matters he was apt to look upon the <<target>> of his eldest daughter as one generally sound and trustworthy .::::opinion
In her appreciation of character , of motives , and the probable conduct <<target>> of men and women , she was usually not far wrong .::::both
She had early foreseen the marriage of Eleanor and John Bold ; she had at a glance deciphered the character of <<target>> new bishop and his chaplain ; could it possibly be that her present surmise should ever come forth as true ?::::the
`` But you do n't think <<target>> she likes him ? ''::::that
`` Well , Papa , I ca n't say that <<target>> think she dislikes him as she ought to do .::::i
Why is he visiting there as a confidential friend , when <<target>> never ought to have been admitted inside the house ?::::he
Why is it that she speaks to him about your <<target>> and your position , as she clearly has done ?::::welfare
At the bishop 's party the other night I saw her <<target>> to him for half an hour at the stretch . ''::::talking
`` I thought Mr. Slope seemed to talk to nobody there but that daughter <<target>> Stanhope 's , '' said Mr. Harding , wishing to defend his child .::::of
To give Eleanor her due , any suspicion as to the slightest <<target>> on her part towards Mr. Slope was a wrong to her .::::inclination
She had no more idea of marrying Mr. Slope than she had of marrying the bishop , <<target>> the idea that Mr. Slope would present himself as a suitor had never occurred to her .::::and
Indeed , to give her her due again , she <<target>> never thought about suitors since her husband 's death .::::had
But nevertheless it was true that she had overcome all that repugnance to the man <<target>> was so strongly felt for him by the rest of the Grantly faction .::::which
She had forgiven <<target>> his sermon .::::him
She had forgiven his pharisaical arrogance , and even <<target>> greasy face and oily , vulgar manners .::::his
Having agreed to overlook such offences as these , why should she <<target>> in time be taught to regard Mr. Slope as a suitor ?::::not
And as to him , it must also be affirmed that <<target>> was hitherto equally innocent of the crime imputed to him .::::he
How it had come to pass that a man whose eyes were generally so widely open to everything around him <<target>> not perceived that this young widow was rich as well as beautiful , can not probably now be explained .::::had
But such was <<target>> fact .::::the
Mr. Slope had ingratiated <<target>> with Mrs .::::himself
He subsequently amended his error , but it was not <<target>> after the interview between him and Mr. Harding .::::till
He seemed to be in an especial good humour , and welcomed his father-in-law with a sort of jovial earnestness <<target>> was usual with him when things on which he was intent were going on as he would have them .::::that
He 'll be here <<target>> week . ''::::next
And the archdeacon scrubbed his hands and rubbed his face with a violent <<target>> , which showed that Arabin 's coming was a great point gained .::::alacrity
`` Will he come <<target>> to Plumstead ? ''::::here
`` He has promised to stay a month with us , '' said the <<target>> , `` so that he may see what his parish is like .::::archdeacon
You 'll like <<target>> very much .::::arabin
`` Well -- he is a little odd in some of his <<target>> , but there 's nothing about him you wo n't like .::::fancies
He is as staunch a churchman <<target>> there is at Oxford .::::as
I really do n't know what <<target>> should do without Arabin .::::we
It 's a great thing for me to have him so near me , <<target>> if anything can put Slope down , Arabin will do it . ''::::and
The Reverend Francis Arabin was a fellow of Lazarus , the favoured disciple of the great Dr. Gwynne , a High Churchman at all points -- so high , indeed , that at one period of his career he had all but toppled over into the cesspool of <<target>> -- a poet and also a polemical writer , a great pet in the common-rooms at Oxford , an eloquent clergyman , a droll , odd , humorous , energetic , conscientious man , and , as the archdeacon had boasted of him , a thorough gentleman .::::rome
As he will hereafter be brought more closely to our notice , it is now only necessary to add that he had <<target>> been presented to the vicarage of St. Ewold by Dr. Grantly , in whose gift as archdeacon the living lay .::::just
St. Ewold is a parish lying <<target>> without the city of Barchester .::::just
The suburbs of the new town , indeed , are partly within its precincts , and <<target>> pretty church and parsonage are not much above a mile distant from the city gate .::::the
St. Ewold is not a rich piece of preferment -- it is worth some three or four hundred <<target>> year at most , and has generally been held by a clergyman attached to the cathedral choir .::::a
The archdeacon , however , felt , when the living on this occasion became vacant , that it imperatively behoved him to aid <<target>> force of his party with some tower of strength , if any such tower could be got to occupy St. Ewold 's .::::the
He had discussed the matter with his brethren in Barchester , not in any weak spirit as the holder of patronage to be used for his own or <<target>> family 's benefit , but as one to whom was committed a trust on the due administration of which much of the church 's welfare might depend .::::his
He had submitted to them the name of Mr. Arabin , as though the choice had rested with them all in conclave , <<target>> they had unanimously admitted that , if Mr. Arabin would accept St. Ewold 's , no better choice could possibly be made .::::and
If Mr. Arabin would <<target>> St. Ewold 's !::::accept
He was not a rich man , it is true , for he held no preferment but his fellowship ; but he was a man not over-anxious for riches , not married <<target>> course , and one whose time was greatly taken up in discussing , both in print and on platforms , the privileges and practices of the church to which he belonged .::::of
As the archdeacon had done battle for its temporalities , so did Mr. Arabin do battle for its spiritualities , and both <<target>> done so conscientiously ; that is , not so much each for his own benefit as for that of others .::::had
Holding such a position as Mr. Arabin did , there was much reason to doubt whether he would consent to become the <<target>> of St. Ewold 's , and Dr. Grantly had taken the trouble to go himself to Oxford on the matter .::::parson
Dr. Gwynne and Dr. Grantly together had succeeded in persuading this <<target>> divine that duty required him to go to Barchester .::::eminent
There were wheels within <<target>> in this affair .::::wheels
For some time past Mr. Arabin had been engaged in a tremendous controversy <<target>> no less a person than Mr. Slope , respecting the apostolic succession .::::with
These two gentlemen had never seen each other , <<target>> they had been extremely bitter in print .::::but
The matter , however , had become too tedious for the readers of `` The Jupiter , '' and a little note had therefore been appended to one <<target>> Mr. Slope 's most telling rejoinders , in which it had been stated that no further letters from the reverend gentlemen could be inserted except as advertisements .::::of
Other methods of publication were , however , found , less expensive than <<target>> in `` The Jupiter , '' and the war went on merrily .::::advertisements
Mr. Slope declared that the main part of the consecration of a clergyman <<target>> the self-devotion of the inner man to the duties of the ministry .::::was
Mr. Arabin contended that a man was not consecrated at all , had , indeed , no single attribute of a clergyman , unless he became so through the imposition <<target>> some bishop 's hands , who had become a bishop through the imposition of other hands , and so on in a direct line to one of the apostles .::::of
Each had repeatedly hung the other on the horns of a dilemma , but neither seemed to <<target>> a whit the worse for the hanging ; and so the war went on merrily .::::be
Whether or no the near neighbourhood of the foe may have acted in any way as an inducement to Mr. Arabin to accept the living of St. Ewold , we will not pretend to say ; but it had at any rate been <<target>> in Dr. Gwynne 's library , at Lazarus , that he would accept it , and that he would lend his assistance towards driving the enemy out of Barchester , or , at any rate , silencing him while he remained there .::::settled
Mr. Arabin intended to keep his rooms at Oxford and to have the assistance of a curate at St. Ewold , but he promised to give <<target>> much time as possible to the neighbourhood of Barchester , and from so great a man Dr. Grantly was quite satisfied with such a promise .::::as
It was no small part of the satisfaction derivable from such an arrangement that Bishop Proudie would be <<target>> to institute into a living immediately under his own nose the enemy of his favourite chaplain .::::forced
All through dinner the archdeacon 's good <<target>> shone brightly in his face .::::humour
He ate of the good things heartily , he drank wine with his wife and daughter , he talked pleasantly of his doings at <<target>> , told his father-in-law that he ought to visit Dr. Gwynne at Lazarus , and launched out again in praise of Mr. Arabin .::::oxford
`` Is Mr. Arabin <<target>> , Papa ? ''::::married

But even this , sad as it was , did not much diminish <<target>> archdeacon 's good humour , though it greatly added to his pugnacity .::::the
`` He ca n't do it , '' said Dr. Grantly over and over again , as his father-in-law explained to him <<target>> terms on which the new warden of the hospital was to be appointed ; `` he ca n't do it .::::the

Mr. Harding winced at the <<target>> of the press .::::idea

The archdeacon drank off his glass of <<target>> and prepared himself to be energetic .::::claret

`` If honest men did not squabble for money , in this wicked world of ours , the dishonest men <<target>> get it all , and I do not see that the cause of virtue would be much improved .::::would

`` I think all quarrels between a clergyman and his <<target>> should be avoided , '' said Mr. Harding .::::bishop
`` I think so too , but it is quite as much the <<target>> of the bishop to look to that as of his inferior .::::duty
I tell you what , my friend ; I 'll see the bishop in this matter -- that <<target>> , if you will allow me -- and you may be sure I will not compromise you .::::is
My opinion is that all this trash about the Sunday-schools and the sermons has originated <<target>> with Slope and Mrs. Proudie , and that the bishop knows nothing about it .::::wholly

And as to the seats in the cathedral , <<target>> may safely leave that to Mr. Dean .::::we
I believe the fool positively thinks that the bishop could <<target>> away with the cathedral if he pleased . ''::::walk
And so the matter <<target>> arranged between them .::::was
Mr. Harding had come expressly for advice , and therefore <<target>> himself bound to take the advice given him .::::felt
He had known , moreover , beforehand that the archdeacon would not hear of his giving the matter up , and <<target>> , though he had in perfect good faith put forward his own views , he was prepared to yield .::::accordingly
They therefore went into the drawing-room in good humour with each other , and the <<target>> passed pleasantly in prophetic discussions on the future wars of Arabin and Slope .::::evening
The frogs and the mice would be nothing to <<target>> , nor the angers of Agamemnon and Achilles .::::them
How the archdeacon rubbed his hands and plumed <<target>> on the success of his last move .::::himself
He could not himself descend into the arena with <<target>> , but Arabin would have no such scruples .::::slope
Arabin was exactly the man for such work , and the <<target>> man whom he knew that was fit for it .::::only
And then certainly <<target>> was startled .::::he
The last words he said <<target>> night were as follows :::::that
`` If she does , by heaven <<target>> 'll never speak to her again .::::i
She dragged me into the mire once , but I 'll not pollute myself with such filth as that -- '' And the <<target>> gave a shudder which shook the whole room , so violently was he convulsed with the thought which then agitated his mind .::::archdeacon
Now in this matter the widow Bold <<target>> scandalously ill-treated by her relatives .::::was
She had spoken to the man three or four times , <<target>> had expressed her willingness to teach in a Sunday-school .::::and
Such was the full extent of her <<target>> in the matter of Mr. Slope .::::sins
The next morning Mr. Harding returned to Barchester , no further word having been <<target>> in his hearing respecting Mr. Slope 's acquaintance with his younger daughter .::::spoken
But he observed that the archdeacon at breakfast was less <<target>> than he had been on the preceding evening .::::cordial
Bold was worth <<target>> wooing .::::the
He rode out to Puddingdale to communicate to the embryo warden the goodwill of the bishop in his favour , and during the discussion <<target>> the matter it was not unnatural that the pecuniary resources of Mr. Harding and his family should become the subject of remark .::::on
Mr. Quiverful , with his fourteen children and his four hundred a year , was a very poor man , and the <<target>> of this new preferment , which was to be held together with his living , was very grateful to him .::::prospect
To what clergyman so circumstanced would not <<target>> a prospect be very grateful ?::::such
What man as needy as Mr. <<target>> would have been more disinterested ?::::quiverful
`` Mr. Harding did positively refuse it , '' said Mr. Slope with a certain air of <<target>> dignity , `` when he heard of the conditions to which the appointment is now subjected .::::offended
Of course you understand , Mr. Quiverful , that <<target>> same conditions will be imposed on yourself . ''::::the
Mr. Quiverful cared nothing <<target>> the conditions .::::for
What sacrifices , or at any rate , what promises would have been too much <<target>> make for such an addition to his income , and for such a house !::::to
But his mind still <<target>> to Mr. Harding .::::recurred
`` To be sure , '' said he ; `` Mr. Harding 's daughter <<target>> very rich , and why should he trouble himself with the hospital ? ''::::is
Bold has twelve hundred a year of her own , and <<target>> suppose Mr. Harding means to live with her . ''::::i
`` Twelve hundred a year <<target>> her own ! ''::::of
said Slope , and very shortly afterwards took his leave , avoiding , as far <<target>> it was possible for him to do , any further allusion to the hospital .::::as
`` Twelve hundred <<target>> year ! ''::::a
said he to himself as <<target>> rode slowly home .::::he
If it were the <<target>> that Mrs .::::fact
Bold had twelve hundred a year of her own , what a fool <<target>> he be to oppose her father 's return to his old place .::::would
The train of Mr. Slope 's ideas will <<target>> be plain to all my readers .::::probably
Why should he not make the <<target>> hundred a year his own ?::::twelve
And if he did so , would it not be well for him <<target>> have a father-in-law comfortably provided with the good things of this world ?::::to
Would it not , moreover , be much more easy for him to gain the <<target>> if he did all in his power to forward the father 's views ?::::daughter
These questions presented themselves to him in a very forcible <<target>> , and yet there were many points of doubt .::::way
If he resolved to restore to Mr. Harding his former place , he must take the necessary steps for doing so at once ; he must immediately talk over the bishop , quarrel on the <<target>> with Mrs. Proudie , whom he knew he could not talk over , and let Mr. Quiverful know that he had been a little too precipitate as to Mr. Harding 's positive refusal .::::matter
That he could effect all this he did not doubt , <<target>> he did not wish to effect it for nothing .::::but
He did not wish to give way to Mr. <<target>> and then be rejected by the daughter .::::harding
He did not wish to lose one <<target>> friend before he had gained another .::::influential
And thus he rode home , <<target>> many things in his mind .::::meditating
It occurred to <<target>> that Mrs .::::him
Bold was sister-in-law to the archdeacon , and that not even for <<target>> hundred a year would he submit to that imperious man .::::twelve
A rich wife was a great desideratum to him , but success in his profession was still greater ; there were , moreover , other rich women who might be <<target>> to become wives ; and after all , this twelve hundred a year might , when inquired into , melt away into some small sum utterly beneath his notice .::::willing
Then also he <<target>> that Mrs .::::remembered
Another circumstance also much influenced him , though it was one which <<target>> almost be said to have influenced him against his will .::::may
The vision of the Signora Neroni <<target>> perpetually before his eyes .::::was
It would be too much to say that Mr. Slope was lost in love , but yet <<target>> thought , and kept continually thinking , that he had never seen so beautiful a woman .::::he
He was a man whose nature was open to such impulses , and the <<target>> of the Italianized charmer had been thoroughly successful in imposing upon his thoughts .::::wiles
His taste had been pleased , his <<target>> charmed , and his vanity gratified .::::eyes
He had been dazzled by a sort of loveliness which he had never before seen , and <<target>> been caught by an easy , free , voluptuous manner which was perfectly new to him .::::had
He had not owned to himself that he cared for this woman more than for others around him , but yet he thought often <<target>> the time when he might see her next , and made , almost unconsciously , little cunning plans for seeing her frequently .::::of
If the signora had been kind in her manner and flattering in her speech when lying upon the bishop 's sofa , with the eyes of so many on <<target>> , she had been much more so in her mother 's drawing-room , with no one present but her sister to repress either her nature or her art .::::her
Mr. Slope had thus left her quite bewildered , and could not willingly admit into his brain any scheme <<target>> part of which would be the necessity of his abandoning all further special friendship with this lady .::::a
And so he slowly rode <<target>> , very meditative .::::along
His motives , like those of most men , were mixed , and though his conduct was generally very different from that which we would <<target>> to praise , it was actuated perhaps as often as that of the majority of the world by a desire to do his duty .::::wish
He believed in the religion which he taught , <<target>> , unpalatable , uncharitable as that religion was .::::harsh
He believed those whom he wished to get under his hoof , the Grantlys <<target>> Gwynnes of the church , to be the enemies of that religion .::::and
He believed himself to be a pillar of strength , destined to do great things , and with that subtle , selfish , ambiguous sophistry to which the minds of all men <<target>> so subject , he had taught himself to think that in doing much for the promotion of his own interests , he was doing much also for the promotion of religion .::::are
But Mr. Slope had never <<target>> an immoral man .::::been
Indeed , he had resisted temptations to immorality with <<target>> strength of purpose that was creditable to him .::::a
He had early in life devoted himself to works which were not compatible with the <<target>> pleasures of youth , and he had abandoned such pleasures not without a struggle .::::ordinary
And thus he rode along <<target>> and ill at ease .::::meditative
His conscience had not a word to say <<target>> his choosing the widow and her fortune .::::against
That he looked upon as a godly work rather than otherwise ; as a deed <<target>> , if carried through , would redound to his credit as a Christian .::::which
On that side lay no future remorse , no conduct which <<target>> might probably have to forget , no inward stings .::::he
If it should turn out to <<target>> really the fact that Mrs .::::be
Bold had twelve hundred a year at her own disposal , Mr. Slope would rather look upon it as a duty which he owed his religion <<target>> make himself the master of the wife and the money ; as a duty too , in which some amount of self-sacrifice would be necessary .::::to
He would have to give up his friendship with the signora , his resistance to Mr. Harding , his antipathy -- <<target>> , he found on mature self-examination that he could not bring himself to give up his antipathy to Dr. Grantly .::::no
He would marry the lady as the enemy of her brother-in-law if such an <<target>> suited her ; if not , she must look elsewhere for a husband .::::arrangement
It was with such resolve as <<target>> that he reached Barchester .::::this
He would at once ascertain what the truth might be as to the lady 's wealth , <<target>> having done this he would be ruled by circumstances in his conduct respecting the hospital .::::and
If he found that he could turn round and secure the place for Mr. Harding without much self-sacrifice , <<target>> would do so ; but if not , he would woo the daughter in opposition to the father .::::he
But in no case would <<target>> succumb to the archdeacon .::::he
To give Mr. Slope his due , he was not a <<target>> who ever let much grass grow under his feet .::::man
She was doomed to be the intended <<target>> of more schemes than one .::::victim
About the time that Mr. Slope was visiting the vicar of Puddingdale , a discussion <<target>> place respecting her charms and wealth at Dr. Stanhope 's house in the close .::::took
There had been morning callers there , and people had told some truth and <<target>> some falsehood respecting the property which John Bold had left behind him .::::also

Charlotte was explaining to her brother that he must make love for himself if he meant to carry on the matter , and <<target>> encouraging him to do so by warm eulogiums on Eleanor 's beauty , when the signora was brought into the drawing-room .::::was

Bertie Stanhope had been so much knocked about the world from his earliest years that he had not retained much respect for the gravity of English customs ; but even to <<target>> mind an idea presented itself that , perhaps in a wife , true British prejudice would not in the long run be less agreeable than Anglo-Italian freedom from restraint .::::his
He did not exactly say so , but <<target>> expressed the idea in another way .::::he

As she tried to cover up the little fellow 's face with her long , glossy , dark brown locks , and permitted him to <<target>> them hither and thither as he would , she looked very beautiful in spite of the widow 's cap which she still wore .::::pull
There was a quiet , enduring , grateful sweetness about her face which grew so strongly upon those who knew her , as to make <<target>> great praise of her beauty which came from her old friends appear marvellously exaggerated to those who were only slightly acquainted with her .::::the
Her loveliness was like that of many landscapes , which <<target>> to be often seen to be fully enjoyed .::::require
There was a depth of dark clear brightness in her eyes which was lost upon a quick observer , a character about her mouth which only showed itself <<target>> those with whom she familiarly conversed , a glorious form of head the perfect symmetry of which required the eye of an artist for its appreciation .::::to
She had none of that dazzling brilliancy , of that voluptuous Rubens beauty , of that pearly whiteness , and <<target>> vermilion tints which immediately entranced with the power of a basilisk men who came within reach of Madeline Neroni .::::those

You might begin to talk to her as though she were your sister , and it would not be till your head was on your <<target>> that the truth and intensity of her beauty would flash upon you , that the sweetness of her voice would come upon your ear .::::pillow

It would have been perhaps better for her that she had not , for she thus <<target>> more of her confusion than she would have done had she remained as she was .::::showed
Mr. Slope , however , immediately recognized her loveliness and thought to himself that , irrespective of her fortune , she would be an inmate <<target>> a man might well desire for his house , a partner for his bosom 's care very well qualified to make care lie easy .::::that
Eleanor hurried out of the room to readjust her <<target>> , muttering some unnecessary apology about her baby .::::cap
And while she is gone , we will briefly go back and state what had <<target>> hitherto the results of Mr. Slope 's meditations on his scheme of matrimony .::::been
His inquiries as to the widow 's income had at any rate been so <<target>> successful as to induce him to determine to go on with the speculation .::::far
As regarded Mr. Harding , he had also resolved <<target>> do what he could without injury to himself .::::to
To Mrs. Proudie he determined not to speak on <<target>> matter , at least not at present .::::the
His object was to instigate a little <<target>> on the part of the bishop .::::rebellion
He thought that such a state of things would be advisable , not only in respect <<target>> Messrs. Harding and Quiverful , but also in the affairs of the diocese generally .::::to
Mr. Slope was by no means of opinion that Dr. Proudie was fit to rule , <<target>> he conscientiously thought it wrong that his brother clergy should be subjected to petticoat government .::::but
He therefore made up his mind to infuse a little of his spirit into the bishop , <<target>> to induce him to oppose his wife , though not enough to make him altogether insubordinate .::::sufficient
He had therefore taken an opportunity of again speaking to his lordship about the hospital , and had endeavoured <<target>> make it appear that after all it would be unwise to exclude Mr. Harding from the appointment .::::to
Mr. Slope , however , had a <<target>> task than he had imagined .::::harder
Mrs. Proudie , anxious to assume to herself as much as possible of the merit of patronage , had written to Mrs. Quiverful , requesting her to call at the <<target>> , and had then explained to that matron , with much mystery , condescension , and dignity , the good that was in store for her and her progeny .::::palace
Indeed , Mrs. Proudie had been so engaged at the very time that Mr. Slope had been doing <<target>> same with the husband at Puddingdale Vicarage , and had thus in a measure committed herself .::::the
The thanks , the humility , the gratitude , the surprise of Mrs. Quiverful had been very overpowering ; she had all but embraced the knees of her patroness , and had promised that the prayers of fourteen unprovided babes ( <<target>> Mrs. Quiverful had described her own family , the eldest of which was a stout young woman of three-and-twenty ) should be put up to heaven morning and evening for the munificent friend whom God had sent to them .::::so
Such incense as this was not unpleasing to Mrs. <<target>> , and she made the most of it .::::proudie
She offered her general assistance to the fourteen unprovided babes , if , as she had no doubt , she should find them worthy ; expressed a hope that <<target>> eldest of them would be fit to undertake tuition in her Sabbath-schools ; and altogether made herself a very great lady in the estimation of Mrs. Quiverful .::::the
Having done this , she thought it prudent to drop a few words before the bishop , letting him know that she <<target>> acquainted the Puddingdale family with their good fortune ; so that he might perceive that he stood committed to the appointment .::::had
The husband well understood the ruse of his <<target>> , but he did not resent it .::::wife
He knew that she was taking the patronage out of his hands ; he <<target>> resolved to put an end to her interference and reassume his powers .::::was
But then he thought this was not <<target>> best time to do it .::::the
He put off the evil hour , as many <<target>> man in similar circumstances has done before him .::::a
Such having been the case , Mr. Slope naturally encountered a difficulty in talking over the bishop , a difficulty <<target>> which he found could not be overcome except at the cost of a general outbreak at the palace .::::indeed
A general outbreak at the present moment might be <<target>> policy , but it also might not .::::good
It was at any rate not <<target>> step to be lightly taken .::::a
He began by whispering to the bishop that he feared that public opinion <<target>> be against him if Mr. Harding did not reappear at the hospital .::::would
The bishop answered with some warmth that Mr. Quiverful had <<target>> promised the appointment on Mr. Slope 's advice .::::been
`` Yes , promised , '' replied the bishop , `` <<target>> Mrs. Proudie has seen Mrs. Quiverful on the subject . ''::::and
This was quite unexpected on the part of Mr. Slope , but his presence of <<target>> did not fail him , and he turned the statement to his own account .::::mind
`` Ah , my lord , '' said he , `` <<target>> shall all be in scrapes if the ladies interfere . ''::::we
This was too much in unison with my lord 's feelings to be <<target>> unpalatable , and yet such an allusion to interference demanded a rebuke .::::altogether
My lord was somewhat astounded also , though not altogether made miserable , by <<target>> that there was a point of difference between his wife and his chaplain .::::finding
`` I do n't know what you mean <<target>> interference , '' said the bishop mildly .::::by
`` When Mrs. Proudie heard that Mr. Quiverful was to be appointed , it <<target>> not unnatural that she should wish to see Mrs. Quiverful about the schools .::::was
I really can not say that <<target>> see any interference . ''::::i
`` I only speak , my lord , for your own comfort , '' <<target>> Slope ; `` for your own comfort and dignity in the diocese .::::said
I can have <<target>> other motive .::::no
As far as personal feelings go , Mrs. <<target>> is the best friend I have .::::proudie
I must always <<target>> that .::::remember
But still , in my present position , <<target>> first duty is to your lordship . ''::::my
`` I 'm sure of that , Mr. Slope ; I am quite sure of that ; '' said <<target>> bishop , mollified : `` and you really think that Mr. Harding should have the hospital ? ''::::the
I am quite prepared to take upon myself the <<target>> of first suggesting Mr. Quiverful 's name .::::blame
But since doing so , I have found that there is so strong a feeling in <<target>> diocese in favour of Mr. Harding that I think your lordship should give way .::::the
I hear also that Mr. Harding has modified the <<target>> he first felt to your lordship 's propositions .::::objections
And thus the poor bishop was left in a <<target>> undecided step as to what he should do .::::dreadfully
His mind , however , slightly inclined itself to the appointment of Mr. Harding , seeing that <<target>> such a step he should have the assistance of Mr. Slope in opposing Mrs. Proudie .::::by
Such was the state of affairs at the <<target>> , when Mr. Slope called at Mrs .::::palace
Bold 's house and found <<target>> playing with her baby .::::her
When she ran out of the room , Mr. Slope began praising the weather to Mary Bold , then he praised <<target>> baby and kissed him , and then he praised the mother , and then he praised Miss Bold herself .::::the
Bold , however , was not <<target>> before she came back .::::long
`` I have to apologize for calling at so very early an hour , '' began Mr. Slope , `` but <<target>> was really so anxious to speak to you that I hope you and Miss Bold will excuse me . ''::::i
Eleanor muttered something in which the words `` certainly , '' and `` of course , '' and `` not early at all , '' were just audible , <<target>> then apologized for her own appearance , declaring , with a smile , that her baby was becoming such a big boy that he was quite unmanageable .::::and
`` He 's a great big naughty boy , '' said she to the child , `` and we must send him away to a great big rough romping school , where they have great big rods and do terrible things to <<target>> boys who do n't do what their own mammas tell them ; '' and she then commenced another course of kissing , being actuated thereto by the terrible idea of sending her child away which her own imagination had depicted .::::naughty
`` And where the masters do n't have such beautiful long hair to be dishevelled , '' <<target>> Mr. Slope , taking up the joke and paying a compliment at the same time .::::said
Eleanor thought he might as well have left the compliment alone , but she <<target>> nothing and looked nothing , being occupied as she was with the baby .::::said
Miss Bold had heard Mr. Slope say he had something pressing to say to Eleanor , and thinking <<target>> she might be _de trop_ , took this opportunity of getting herself out of the room .::::that
`` Do n't be long , Mary , '' <<target>> Eleanor as Miss Bold shut the door .::::said
`` I am <<target>> , Mrs .::::glad
`` Will you let me openly <<target>> you a plain question ? ''::::ask
`` And I am sure you will give <<target>> a plain and open answer . ''::::me
`` Either that , or none at <<target>> , '' said she , laughing .::::all
`` My question is <<target>> , Mrs .::::this
Bold : is your father really anxious <<target>> go back to the hospital ? ''::::to
`` Why do you <<target>> me ? ''::::ask
`` Why do n't <<target>> ask himself ? ''::::you
Bold , I 'll <<target>> you why .::::tell
There are wheels within wheels , all of which I would explain <<target>> you , only I fear that there is not time .::::to
It is essentially necessary that I should have an answer to this question , otherwise I can not know <<target>> to advance your father 's wishes ; and it is quite impossible that I should ask himself .::::how
`` I must be candid with you as the only means of <<target>> ultimate consequences , which may be most injurious to Mr. Harding .::::avoiding

`` Oh , Mr. Slope , we need not <<target>> back to that , '' said Eleanor .::::go
`` For one <<target>> , Mrs .::::moment
It is not that I may talk of myself , but because <<target>> is so essential that you should understand how matters stand .::::it
It may be that he has proper cause , but the result <<target>> that he is not inclined to meet me on friendly terms .::::is
I put it to yourself whether you do <<target>> know this to be the case . ''::::not
Eleanor made no answer , and Mr. Slope , in the eagerness of his address , <<target>> his chair a little nearer to the widow 's seat , unperceived by her .::::edged
`` Such being so , '' continued Mr. Slope , `` I can <<target>> ask him this question as I can ask it of you .::::not

`` To you I can speak openly <<target>> explain the feelings of my heart .::::and
This your father <<target>> not allow .::::would
Unfortunately , the bishop has thought it right that this <<target>> of the hospital should pass through my hands .::::matter
There have been some details to get up with which he would not trouble himself , and thus it <<target>> come to pass that I was forced to have an interview with your father on the matter . ''::::has
`` I am aware of <<target>> , '' said Eleanor .::::that
`` In that interview Mr. Harding left the impression on my mind <<target>> he did not wish to return to the hospital . ''::::that
`` How could <<target>> be ? ''::::that
said Eleanor , at last stirred up to forget the <<target>> propriety of demeanour which she had determined to maintain .::::cold
`` And what is more than that , before my interview with Mr. Harding , certain persons at <<target>> palace -- I do not mean the bishop -- had told me that such was the fact .::::the
I own , I hardly believed it ; I own , I thought that your father would wish on every account , for conscience ' sake , for the sake of <<target>> old men , for old association and the memory of dear days long gone by , on every account I thought that he would wish to resume his duties .::::those
But I was told that such was not his wish , and he certainly <<target>> me with the impression that I had been told the truth . ''::::left
said Eleanor , now sufficiently <<target>> on the matter .::::roused
`` I hear Miss Bold 's step , '' said Mr. Slope ; `` would it be asking too <<target>> a favour to beg you to -- I know you can manage anything with Miss Bold . ''::::great
Eleanor did not like the word manage , but still she went out <<target>> asked Mary to leave them alone for another quarter of an hour .::::and
Bold -- I am so <<target>> grateful for this confidence .::::very
Well , I left your <<target>> with this impression .::::father
Indeed , I may say that he made <<target>> understand that he declined the appointment . ''::::me
`` I am sure he <<target>> not decline the appointment .::::did
But he said that he would not agree -- that is , that he <<target>> not like the scheme about the schools and the services and all that .::::did
I am quite sure he never said that <<target>> wished to refuse the place . ''::::he
said Mr. Slope in <<target>> manner almost impassioned .::::a
`` I would not for the world say to so <<target>> a daughter a word against so good a father .::::good
But you must , for his sake , let me <<target>> you exactly how the matter stands at present .::::show
Mr. Harding was a little flurried when I told <<target>> of the bishop 's wishes about the school .::::him
I did so perhaps with the less caution because you yourself <<target>> so perfectly agreed with me on the same subject .::::had
He was a little put <<target>> and spoke warmly .::::out
'Tell the bishop , ' said he , 'that I quite disagree with him -- <<target>> shall not return to the hospital as such conditions are attached to it . '::::and
What he said was to that effect ; indeed , <<target>> words were , if anything , stronger than those .::::his
I had no alternative but to repeat them to his lordship , who said <<target>> he could look on them in no other light than a refusal .::::that
He also had heard the report that your father did not wish for the appointment , and putting <<target>> these things together , he thought he had no choice but to look for someone else .::::all
He has consequently offered <<target>> place to Mr .::::the
`` Offered the <<target>> to Mr .::::place

`` Then , Mr. Slope , there <<target>> an end of it . ''::::is
`` No , my friend -- <<target>> so , '' said he .::::not
`` It is to prevent such being the <<target>> of it that I am now here .::::end
I may at any rate presume that I have got an answer to <<target>> question , and that Mr. Harding is desirous of returning . ''::::my
`` Desirous of returning -- of course he is , '' said Eleanor ; `` of course he wishes to have back his house and his income and his place in the world ; to <<target>> back what he gave up with such self-denying honesty , if he can have them without restraints on his conduct to which at his age it would be impossible that he should submit .::::have
How can the bishop ask a man of his age <<target>> turn schoolmaster to a pack of children ? ''::::to
I can at any rate promise you that I will <<target>> be the medium of any so absurd a requisition .::::not
We wished your father to preach in the hospital , as the inmates may naturally <<target>> too old to leave it , but even that shall not be insisted on .::::be
We wished also to attach a Sabbath-day school to the hospital , thinking that such an establishment could not but <<target>> useful under the surveillance of so good a clergyman as Mr. Harding , and also under your own .::::be

But it is out of the question that Quiverful should <<target>> your father -- quite out of the question .::::supersede

She was older now and felt that she should take no <<target>> in a matter so vital to him without his consent .::::step
`` Why , to tell the truth , '' said Mr. Slope with a look of sorrow , as though he greatly <<target>> the want of charity in his patron , `` the bishop fancies that he has cause of anger against your father .::::bewailed
I fear an interview would <<target>> to further ill-will . ''::::lead
`` Why , '' said Eleanor , `` my father <<target>> the mildest , the gentlest man living . ''::::is
So you would not <<target>> the bishop ?::::see

Eleanor said that nothing occurred to her , but that it was very <<target>> ; the tears came to her eyes and rolled down her cheeks .::::hard
Mr. Slope would have given much to have had the privilege of drying them , but he had tact enough to <<target>> that he had still a great deal to do before he could even hope for any privilege with Mrs .::::know

The widow hardly knew <<target>> answer to make .::::what
She was quite aware that her father would not be at all thankful to Mr. Slope ; she had a strong <<target>> to share her father 's feelings ; and yet she could not but acknowledge that Mr. Slope was very kind .::::wish
Her father , who was generally so charitable to all men , who seldom spoke ill of anyone , <<target>> warned her against Mr. Slope , and yet she did not know how to abstain from thanking him .::::had
What interest could he have in the <<target>> but that which he professed ?::::matter
Nevertheless there was that in his <<target>> which even she distrusted .::::manner
She felt , she did not know why , that there was <<target>> about him which ought to put her on her guard .::::something
Mr. Slope read all this in her hesitating manner just as <<target>> as though she had opened her heart to him .::::plainly
It was the talent of the man that he could so <<target>> the inward feelings of women with whom he conversed .::::read

But his ardent and enthusiastic spirit could not long brook an idleness that seemed begotten of sin ; and one pleasant August morning , in the <<target>> of grace 1770 , Father Jose issued from the outer court of the Mission building , equipped to explore the field for new missionary labors .::::year
Nothing could exceed the quiet gravity <<target>> unpretentiousness of the little cavalcade .::::and
First rode a stout muleteer , leading a pack-mule laden with the provisions of <<target>> party , together with a few cheap crucifixes and hawks ' bells .::::the
After him came the devout Padre Jose , bearing his breviary and cross , with a black serapa thrown around his shoulders ; while on either <<target>> trotted a dusky convert , anxious to show a proper sense of their regeneration by acting as guides into the wilds of their heathen brethren .::::side
Their new condition was agreeably shown by the absence of the usual mud-plaster , <<target>> in their unconverted state they assumed to keep away vermin and cold .::::which
The morning was <<target>> and propitious .::::bright
Before their departure , mass had been said in the chapel , and the protection of St. Ignatius invoked against all contingent evils , <<target>> especially against bears , which , like the fiery dragons of old , seemed to cherish unconquerable hostility to the Holy Church .::::but
As they wound through the canyon , charming birds disported upon boughs and sprays , and sober quails piped from <<target>> alders ; the willowy water-courses gave a musical utterance , and the long grass whispered on the hillside .::::the
On entering the deeper defiles , above them towered dark green masses <<target>> pine , and occasionally the madrono shook its bright scarlet berries .::::of
As they toiled up many a steep ascent , Father Jose sometimes picked up fragments <<target>> scoria , which spake to his imagination of direful volcanoes and impending earthquakes .::::of
To the less scientific mind of the muleteer Ignacio they had even a more terrifying significance ; <<target>> he once or twice snuffed the air suspiciously , and declared that it smelt of sulphur .::::and
So the first day of their journey wore away , and <<target>> night they encamped without having met a single heathen face .::::at
It was on this night that the Enemy of <<target>> appeared to Ignacio in an appalling form .::::souls
He had retired to a secluded part of the camp and had sunk upon his knees in prayerful <<target>> , when he looked up and perceived the Arch-Fiend in the likeness of a monstrous bear .::::meditation
Wisely conceiving this remarkable attitude to be in mockery and derision <<target>> his devotions , the worthy muleteer was transported with fury .::::of
Seizing an arquebuse , he instantly <<target>> his eyes and fired .::::closed
When he had recovered from the effects of <<target>> terrific discharge , the apparition had disappeared .::::the
Father Jose , awakened by the report , reached the spot only in time to chide the muleteer for wasting <<target>> and ball in a contest with one whom a single ave would have been sufficient to utterly discomfit .::::powder
What further reliance he placed on Ignacio 's story is not known ; but , in commemoration of a worthy Californian custom , the place was called La Canada <<target>> la Tentacion del Pio Muletero , or `` The Glen of the Temptation of the Pious Muleteer , '' a name which it retains to this day .::::de
The next morning the party , issuing from a narrow gorge , came <<target>> a long valley , sear and burnt with the shadeless heat .::::upon
Its lower extremity was lost in a fading line of low hills , which , gathering might and <<target>> toward the upper end of the valley , upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy North .::::volume
The peak of this awful spur was just touched by a <<target>> cloud that shifted to and fro like a banneret .::::fleecy
Father Jose gazed at it <<target>> mingled awe and admiration .::::with
By a singular coincidence , the muleteer Ignacio <<target>> the simple ejaculation `` Diablo ! ''::::uttered
As they penetrated the valley , they soon began to miss the <<target>> life and companionable echoes of the canyon they had quitted .::::agreeable
Huge fissures in the parched soil seemed <<target>> gape as with thirsty mouths .::::to
A few squirrels darted from the earth , <<target>> disappeared as mysteriously before the jingling mules .::::and
A gray wolf trotted <<target>> along just ahead .::::leisurely
But whichever way Father Jose turned , the mountain <<target>> asserted itself and arrested his wandering eye .::::always
Out of the dry and arid valley , it <<target>> to spring into cooler and bracing life .::::seemed
Deep cavernous shadows dwelt along its base ; rocky fastnesses appeared midway of its elevation ; <<target>> on either side huge black hills diverged like massy roots from a central trunk .::::and
His lively fancy pictured these hills peopled with a majestic and intelligent race of savages ; <<target>> looking into futurity , he already saw a monstrous cross crowning the dome-like summit .::::and
Far different were the sensations of the muleteer , who saw in <<target>> awful solitudes only fiery dragons , colossal bears and break-neck trails .::::those
At nightfall they reached the <<target>> of the mountain .::::base
Here Father Jose unpacked his mules , said vespers , and , formally ringing his <<target>> , called upon the Gentiles within hearing to come and accept the Holy Faith .::::bell
Nor were the devotions of the muleteer again disturbed , although he afterward asserted , that , <<target>> the Father 's exhortation was ended , a mocking peal of laughter came from the mountain .::::when
Nothing daunted by these intimations of the near hostility of the Evil One , Father Jose declared his intention to <<target>> the mountain at early dawn ; and before the sun rose the next morning he was leading the way .::::ascend
The ascent was in many <<target>> difficult and dangerous .::::places
Huge fragments of rock often lay across the trail , and after a few hours ' climbing <<target>> were forced to leave their mules in a little gully , and continue the ascent afoot .::::they
Unaccustomed to such exertion , Father Jose often stopped <<target>> wipe the perspiration from his thin cheeks .::::to
As the day wore on , <<target>> strange silence oppressed them .::::a
Except the occasional pattering of a squirrel , or a rustling <<target>> the chimisal bushes , there were no signs of life .::::in
The half-human print of a bear 's foot sometimes appeared <<target>> them , at which Ignacio always crossed himself piously .::::before
The eye was sometimes cheated by a dripping from the rocks , which on <<target>> inspection proved to be a resinous oily liquid with an abominable sulphurous smell .::::closer
Below him lay a succession of valleys opening into each other <<target>> gentle lakes , until they were lost to the southward .::::like
Westerly the distant range hid the bosky canada <<target>> sheltered the mission of San Pablo .::::which
In the farther distance the Pacific Ocean stretched away , bearing a cloud of fog upon its bosom , which crept through the entrance of <<target>> bay , and rolled thickly between him and the northeastward ; the same fog hid the base of mountain and the view beyond .::::the
Still , from time to time the fleecy veil parted , and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers , mountain <<target>> , and rolling plains , sear with ripened oats , and bathed in the glow of the setting sun .::::defiles
As Father Jose gazed , he <<target>> penetrated with a pious longing .::::was
Already his imagination , filled with enthusiastic conceptions , beheld all that vast expanse gathered <<target>> the mild sway of the Holy Faith , and peopled with zealous converts .::::under
Each little knoll in fancy became crowned with a chapel ; from <<target>> dark canyon gleamed the white walls of a mission building .::::each
He already saw the spires of stately cathedrals , the <<target>> of palaces , vineyards , gardens , and groves .::::domes
Convents , half hid among the hills , peeping from plantations of branching <<target>> ; and long processions of chanting nuns wound through the defiles .::::limes
He was busied in these fanciful imaginings , when suddenly over that extended prospect <<target>> faint , distant tolling of a bell rang sadly out and died .::::the
Father Jose listened <<target>> superstitious exaltation .::::with
The mission of San Pablo was far away , <<target>> the sound must have been some miraculous omen .::::and
But never before , to his enthusiastic sense , did the <<target>> seriousness of this angelic symbol come with such strange significance .::::sweet
With the last faint peal , his glowing fancy seemed to cool ; the fog closed <<target>> below him , and the good Father remembered he had not had his supper .::::in
He had risen and was wrapping his serapa around him , when <<target>> perceived for the first time that he was not alone .::::he
Nearly opposite , and where should have been the faithless <<target>> , a grave and decorous figure was seated .::::ignacio
His appearance was that of an elderly hidalgo , dressed in mourning , <<target>> mustaches of iron-gray carefully waxed and twisted around a pair of lantern-jaws .::::with
The monstrous hat and prodigious feather , the enormous ruff and exaggerated trunk-hose , <<target>> with a frame shrivelled and wizened , all belonged to a century previous .::::contrasted
Yet Father Jose <<target>> not astonished .::::was
His adventurous life and poetic imagination , continually on the lookout for the <<target>> , gave him a certain advantage over the practical and material minded .::::marvellous
He instantly detected the diabolical quality of <<target>> visitant , and was prepared .::::his
With equal coolness and courtesy he <<target>> the cavalier 's obeisance .::::met
`` I ask your pardon , Sir Priest , '' <<target>> the stranger , `` for disturbing your meditations .::::said
Pleasant they must have been , and right fanciful , I <<target>> , when occasioned by so fair a prospect . ''::::imagine
For there can be none lack such diligence in the True Faith , but <<target>> see that even the conversion of these pitiful salvages hath a meaning .::::may
As the blessed St. Ignatius discreetly observes , '' continued Father Jose , clearing his throat and slightly elevating his voice , `` 'the <<target>> is given to the warriors of Christ , even as the pearls of rare discovery which gladden the hearts of shipmen . '::::heathen
Nay , I <<target>> say -- ''::::might
But here the stranger , who had been wrinkling his brows and twisting <<target>> mustaches with well-bred patience , took advantage of an oratorical pause : --::::his
`` It grieves me , Sir Priest , to interrupt the current of your eloquence as <<target>> as I have already broken your meditations ; but the day already waneth to night .::::discourteously
The temptation was great , and the prospect of acquiring some knowledge <<target>> the Great Enemy 's plans not the least trifling object .::::of
And if the truth must be told , there was <<target>> certain decorum about the stranger that interested the Padre .::::a
Though well aware of the Protean shapes the Arch-Fiend could assume , and though free from <<target>> weaknesses of the flesh , Father Jose was not above the temptations of the spirit .::::the
Had the Devil appeared , as in the case of the pious St. Anthony , in the likeness of a comely damsel , the <<target>> Father , with his certain experience of the deceitful sex , would have whisked her away in the saying of a paternoster .::::good
But there was , added to the security of age , a grave sadness about the stranger , -- a thoughtful consciousness <<target>> of being at a great moral disadvantage , -- which at once decided him on a magnanimous course of conduct .::::as
The stranger then proceeded to inform him , that he had <<target>> diligently observing the Holy Father 's triumphs in the valley .::::been
That , far from being greatly exercised thereat , he had been only grieved to <<target>> so enthusiastic and chivalrous an antagonist wasting his zeal in a hopeless work .::::see
For , he observed , the issue of the great battle of Good <<target>> Evil had been otherwise settled , as he would presently show him .::::and
`` It wants but a few moments of night , '' he continued , `` and <<target>> this interval of twilight , as you know , I have been given complete control .::::over
Look to the <<target>> . ''::::west
As the Padre turned , the stranger took his enormous hat <<target>> his head , and waved it three times before him .::::from
At each sweep of the prodigious feather , the fog grew thinner , until it melted <<target>> away , and the former landscape returned , yet warm with the glowing sun .::::impalpably
As Father Jose gazed , a strain of martial music arose from the valley , and issuing from a <<target>> canyon , the good Father beheld a long cavalcade of gallant cavaliers , habited like his companion .::::deep
From time to time the peal of a trumpet swelled fitfully upon the breeze ; the cross <<target>> Santiago glittered , and the royal banners of Castile and Aragon waved over the moving column .::::of
So they moved on solemnly toward the sea , where , in the distance , <<target>> Jose saw stately caravels , bearing the same familiar banner , awaiting them .::::father
The good Padre gazed with conflicting emotions , and <<target>> serious voice of the stranger broke the silence .::::the
Thou hast seen the declining glory of old <<target>> , -- declining as yonder brilliant sun .::::spain
The sceptre she hath wrested from the heathen is <<target>> dropping from her decrepit and fleshless grasp .::::fast
The children she hath fostered <<target>> know her no longer .::::shall
The soil she hath acquired shall be lost to her as irrevocably <<target>> she herself hath thrust the Moor from her own Granada . ''::::as
The stranger paused , and his voice seemed broken by emotion ; at the same time , <<target>> Jose , whose sympathizing heart yearned toward the departing banners , cried in poignant accents , --::::father
`` Farewell , ye gallant <<target>> and Christian soldiers !::::cavaliers
Farewell , thou , <<target>> de Balboa !::::nunes
thou , Alonzo <<target>> Ojeda !::::de
and thou , most <<target>> Las Casas !::::venerable
Farewell , and may Heaven prosper still <<target>> seed ye left behind ! ''::::the
Then turning to the stranger , Father Jose beheld him gravely draw his pocket-handkerchief <<target>> the basket-hilt of his rapier , and apply it decorously to his eyes .::::from
`` Pardon this weakness , Sir Priest , '' said the cavalier , apologetically ; `` but these worthy gentlemen were ancient friends of mine , and have done me many <<target>> delicate service , -- much more , perchance , than these poor sables may signify , '' he added , with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore .::::a
Father Jose was too much preoccupied in reflection to notice the equivocal nature of this tribute , <<target>> , after a few moments ' silence , said , as if continuing his thought , --::::and
`` But the seed they have planted shall <<target>> and prosper on this fruitful soil . ''::::thrive
`` Look to <<target>> East ! ''::::the
The Father turned , and , as the fog broke away before <<target>> waving plume , he saw that the sun was rising .::::the
Issuing with its bright beams through the passes of the <<target>> mountains beyond , appeared a strange and motley crew .::::snowy
Instead of the dark and romantic visages of his last phantom train , the Father <<target>> with strange concern the blue eyes and flaxen hair of a Saxon race .::::beheld
In place of martial airs and musical utterance , there rose upon <<target>> ear a strange din of harsh gutturals and singular sibilation .::::the
Instead of the decorous tread and stately mien of the cavaliers of the <<target>> vision , they came pushing , bustling , panting , and swaggering .::::former
And as they passed , the good Father noticed that giant trees were prostrated as with the breath <<target>> a tornado , and the bowels of the earth were torn and rent as with a convulsion .::::of
And Father Jose looked in vain for holy cross or Christian symbol ; there was but one that seemed an <<target>> , and he crossed himself with holy horror as he perceived it bore the effigy of a bear .::::ensign
`` Who are these <<target>> Ishmaelites ? ''::::swaggering
he asked , with something <<target>> asperity in his tone .::::of
The stranger was <<target>> silent .::::gravely
`` What do they here , with <<target>> cross nor holy symbol ? ''::::neither
`` Have you the courage to <<target>> , Sir Priest ? ''::::see
Father Jose felt his crucifix , as a <<target>> traveller might his rapier , and assented .::::lonely
`` Step under the shadow of my <<target>> , '' said the stranger .::::plume
Father Jose stepped beside him , and <<target>> instantly sank through the earth .::::they
When he opened his eyes , which had remained closed in prayerful meditation during his rapid descent , <<target>> found himself in a vast vault , bespangled overhead with luminous points like the starred firmament .::::he
It was also lighted by a yellow glow that seemed to proceed from <<target>> mighty sea or lake that occupied the centre of the chamber .::::a
Around this subterranean sea dusky figures flitted , bearing ladles filled with <<target>> yellow fluid , which they had replenished from its depths .::::the
From this lake diverging streams of the same mysterious <<target>> penetrated like mighty rivers the cavernous distance .::::flood
As they walked by the banks of this glittering Styx , Father <<target>> perceived how the liquid stream at certain places became solid .::::jose
The ground was strewn <<target>> glittering flakes .::::with
One of these the Padre <<target>> up and curiously examined .::::picked
An expression of discomfiture overcast the good Father 's face at this discovery ; but there was trace neither <<target>> malice nor satisfaction in the stranger 's air , which was still of serious and fateful contemplation .::::of
`` This , then , Sir <<target>> , is your work !::::devil
This is your deceitful lure for <<target>> weak souls of sinful nations !::::the
So would you replace the Christian <<target>> of holy Spain ! ''::::grace
It lies with you to avert <<target>> issue for a time .::::the
Leave me here <<target>> peace .::::in
Go back to Castile , and take with you <<target>> bells , your images , and your missions .::::your
Continue here , and <<target>> only precipitate results .::::you
promise me you will do this , and you shall not lack that which will render your <<target>> age an ornament and a blessing ; '' and the stranger motioned significantly to the lake .::::old
The worthy Padre , sorely perplexed by his threefold vision , and , if the truth must be told , <<target>> little nettled at this wresting away of the glory of holy Spanish discovery , had shown some hesitation .::::a
But the unlucky bribe of the Enemy <<target>> Souls touched his Castilian spirit .::::of
Starting back in deep disgust , he brandished his crucifix in the face of the unmasked <<target>> , and in a voice that made the dusky vault resound , cried , --::::fiend
Diabolus , I <<target>> thee !::::defy
wouldst thou bribe me , -- me , a brother of the Sacred <<target>> of the Holy Jesus , Licentiate of Cordova and Inquisitor of Guadalaxara ?::::society
Thinkest thou to buy me <<target>> thy sordid treasure ?::::with
What might have been the issue of this rupture , and how complete might have been the triumph of the Holy Father over the Arch-Fiend , who <<target>> recoiling aghast at these sacred titles and the flourishing symbol , we can never know , for at that moment the crucifix slipped through his fingers .::::was
Scarcely had it touched the ground before Devil <<target>> Holy Father simultaneously cast themselves toward it .::::and
A new fear seized his heart , a numbing chillness crept through his <<target>> , and he struggled to free himself , but in vain .::::body
A strange roaring was in his ears ; the lake and cavern danced before his <<target>> and vanished ; and with a loud cry he sank senseless to the ground .::::eyes
When he recovered his consciousness he was aware <<target>> a gentle swaying motion of his body .::::of
He opened his eyes , and saw it was high noon , <<target>> that he was being carried in a litter through the valley .::::and
He felt stiff , and , looking down , perceived <<target>> his arm was tightly bandaged to his side .::::that
He closed his eyes and after a few words of thankful prayer , thought how miraculously <<target>> had been preserved , and made a vow of candlesticks to the blessed Saint Jose .::::he
He then called in a faint voice , <<target>> presently the penitent Ignacio stood beside him .::::and
Blessed Saint Jose , <<target>> lives ! ''::::he
Father Jose , more intent on his last night 's experience , waited <<target>> his emotion to subside , and asked where he had been found .::::for
`` On the mountain , your Reverence , but <<target>> few varas from where he attacked you . ''::::a
`` How ? -- you <<target>> him then ? ''::::saw
asked the Padre , <<target>> unfeigned astonishment .::::in
Mother of God , I <<target>> think I did !::::should
And your Reverence shall see him too , if he <<target>> comes again within range of Ignacio 's arquebuse . ''::::ever
`` Why , the bear , your Reverence , -- the bear , Holy Father , <<target>> attacked your worshipful person while you were meditating on the top of yonder mountain . ''::::who
I would be <<target>> peace . ''::::at
When he reached the Mission , he was tenderly cared for , and in a few weeks was enabled to resume <<target>> duties from which , as will be seen , not even the machinations of the Evil One could divert him .::::those
The news of his physical disaster spread over the country ; and a letter to the <<target>> of Guadalaxara contained a confidential and detailed account of the good Father 's spiritual temptation .::::bishop
But in some way the story leaked out ; and long after Jose was gathered <<target>> his fathers , his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling and whispered narrative .::::to
The mountain was <<target>> shunned .::::generally
It is true that Senor Joaquin Pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain ; but <<target>> Senora Pedrillo was known to be a termagant half-breed , the Senor was not supposed to be over-fastidious .::::as
Such is the Legend <<target>> Monte del Diablo .::::of
As I said before , it <<target>> seem to lack essential corroboration .::::may
The discrepancy between the Father 's narrative and the actual climax has <<target>> rise to some scepticism on the part of ingenious quibblers .::::given
All such I would simply refer to that part of the report of Senor Julio <<target>> , Sub-Prefect of San Pablo , before whom attest of the above was made .::::serro
Touching this matter , the worthy Prefect observes , `` That although the body of Father Jose doth show evidence of grievous conflict in the flesh , yet that is no proof that <<target>> Enemy of Souls , who could assume the figure of a decorous elderly caballero , could not at the same time transform himself into a bear for his own vile purposes . ''::::the
One pleasant New Year 's Eve , about forty years ago , Padre <<target>> was slowly picking his way across the sand-hills from the Mission Dolores .::::vicentio
As he climbed the crest of the ridge beside Mission Creek , his broad , shining face might have been easily <<target>> for the beneficent image of the rising moon , so bland was its smile and so indefinite its features .::::mistaken
For the Padre was a man of notable reputation and character ; his ministration at the mission of San Jose had been marked with cordiality and unction ; he was <<target>> by the simple-minded savages , and had succeeded in impressing his individuality so strongly upon them that the very children were said to have miraculously resembled him in feature .::::adored
As the holy man reached the loneliest portion of the road , he naturally put spurs to his mule as <<target>> to quicken that decorous pace which the obedient animal had acquired through long experience of its master 's habits .::::if
The locality had <<target>> unfavorable reputation .::::an
Sailors -- deserters from whaleships -- had been seen lurking about the outskirts of the town , <<target>> low scrub oaks which everywhere beset the trail might have easily concealed some desperate runaway .::::and
Besides these material obstructions , the devil , whose hostility to the church was well known , was said to sometimes haunt the vicinity in the <<target>> of a spectral whaler , who had met his death in a drunken bout , from a harpoon in the hands of a companion .::::likeness
The ghost of this unfortunate mariner was frequently observed sitting on the hill toward the dusk of evening , armed with his favorite <<target>> and a tub containing a coil of line , looking out for some belated traveller on whom to exercise his professional skill .::::weapon
It is related that the good Father Jose Maria of the Mission Dolores had been twice attacked by this phantom sportsman ; that once , on returning <<target>> San Francisco , and panting with exertion from climbing the hill , he was startled by a stentorian cry of `` There she blows ! ''::::from
quickly followed by a hurtling harpoon , which buried itself in the sand beside him ; that on another occasion <<target>> narrowly escaped destruction , his serapa having been transfixed by the diabolical harpoon and dragged away in triumph .::::he
Popular opinion seems to have been divided as to the reason for the devil 's particular attention to Father Jose , some asserting that the extreme piety of <<target>> Padre excited the Evil One 's animosity , and others that his adipose tendency simply rendered him , from a professional view-point , a profitable capture .::::the
Had Father Vicentio been inclined to scoff at this apparition as a heretical innovation , there was still the story <<target>> Concepcion , the Demon Vaquero , whose terrible riata was fully as potent as the whaler 's harpoon .::::of
Concepcion , when in the flesh , had been a celebrated herder of cattle and wild horses , and was reported to have chased the devil in the shape of <<target>> fleet pinto colt all the way from San Luis Obispo to San Francisco , vowing not to give up the chase until he had overtaken the disguised Arch-Enemy .::::a
The Padre listened attentively for the <<target>> of this terrible rider .::::tramp
But no footfall broke the stillness of the night ; even the <<target>> of his own mule sank noiselessly in the shifting sand .::::hoofs
The melancholy call of plover from the adjoining marshes of Mission Creek came to him so faintly and <<target>> that it seemed almost a recollection of the past rather than a reality of the present .::::fitfully
To add to his discomposure one of those heavy sea-fogs peculiar to <<target>> locality began to drift across the hills and presently encompassed him .::::the
While endeavoring to evade its cold embraces , Padre Vicentio incautiously drove his heavy spurs into the <<target>> of his mule as that puzzled animal was hesitating on the brink of a steep declivity .::::flanks
Whether the poor beast was indignant at this novel outrage , or had been for some time reflecting on the evils of being priest-ridden , has not transpired ; enough that he <<target>> threw up his heels , pitching the reverend man over his head , and , having accomplished this feat , coolly dropped on his knees and tumbled after his rider .::::suddenly
Over and over went the Padre , <<target>> followed by his faithless mule .::::closely
Luckily the little hollow which received the pair was of sand that <<target>> to the superincumbent weight , half burying them without further injury .::::yielded
A hand irreverently laid upon his collar , and <<target>> rough shake , assisted to recall his consciousness .::::a
As the Padre staggered to his feet <<target>> found himself confronted by a stranger .::::he
Seen dimly through the fog , and under circumstances that to say the least <<target>> not prepossessing , the new-comer had an inexpressibly mysterious and brigand-like aspect .::::were
A long boat-cloak concealed his figure , and a slouched hat hid <<target>> features , permitting only his eyes to glisten in the depths .::::his
`` Gad 's <<target>> ! ''::::life
said the stranger , pettishly , `` hast no <<target>> bones in thy fat carcass than a jellyfish ?::::more
Yo , heave <<target>> ! ''::::ho
and he dragged the Padre <<target>> an upright position .::::into
`` Now , then , who <<target>> what art thou ? ''::::and
The Padre could not help thinking that the question might have more properly been asked by himself ; but with an odd mixture of dignity and trepidation he began <<target>> his different titles , which were by no means brief , and would have been alone sufficient to strike awe in the bosom of an ordinary adversary .::::enumerating
`` To think , '' said the stranger , `` that <<target>> should stumble upon the very man I was seeking !::::i
Follow me quickly , for there <<target>> no time to lose . ''::::is
Like most easy natures the positive assertion of the stranger , and withal a certain authoritative air <<target>> command , overcame what slight objections the Padre might have feebly nurtured during this remarkable interview .::::of
The spiritual invitation was one , also , that he dared not refuse ; not only that ; but <<target>> tended somewhat to remove the superstitious dread with which he had begun to regard the mysterious stranger .::::it
But , following at a respectful distance , the Padre could not help observing with a thrill of horror that the stranger 's footsteps made no impression on the <<target>> , and his figure seemed at times to blend and incorporate itself with the fog , until the holy man was obliged to wait for its reappearance .::::sand
In one of these intervals of embarrassment he heard the ringing <<target>> the far-off Mission bell , proclaiming the hour of midnight .::::of
Scarcely had the last stroke died away before the announcement was taken up and repeated by a multitude of bells of <<target>> sizes , and the air was filled with the sound of striking clocks and the pealing of steeple chimes .::::all
The old man uttered <<target>> cry of alarm .::::a
The stranger sharply <<target>> the cause .::::demanded
did you not <<target>> them ? ''::::hear
answered the stranger , `` thy fall hath <<target>> triple bob-majors ringing in thine ears .::::set
The Padre was only too glad to accept <<target>> explanation conveyed in this discourteous answer .::::the
But he was destined <<target>> another singular experience .::::for
When they had reached the summit of the eminence now known <<target>> Russian Hill , an exclamation again burst from the Padre .::::as
The stranger turned to his companion with an impatient <<target>> ; but the Padre heeded him not .::::gesture
The view that burst upon his sight was such as might <<target>> have engrossed the attention of a more enthusiastic temperament .::::well
The fog had not yet reached the hill , and the long valleys and <<target>> of the embarcadero below were glittering with the light of a populous city .::::hillsides
said the Padre , stretching his <<target>> over the spreading landscape .::::hand
`` Look , dost thou not see the stately <<target>> and brilliantly lighted avenues of a mighty metropolis .::::squares
Dost thou not see , as it <<target>> , another firmament below ? ''::::were
`` Behold rather the stars knocked out of thy <<target>> noddle by the fall thou hast had .::::hollow
The Padre humbly followed <<target>> another word .::::without
Descending the hill toward the north , the stranger leading the way , in a few moments the <<target>> detected the wash of waves , and presently his feet struck the firmer sand of the beach .::::padre
Here the stranger paused , and the Padre <<target>> a boat lying in readiness hard by .::::perceived
As he stepped into the stern sheets , in obedience to the command of his companion , he noticed that the rowers seemed to partake of the <<target>> incorporeal texture of his companion , a similarity that became the more distressing when he perceived also that their oars in pulling together made no noise .::::misty
The stranger , assuming the helm , guided the boat on quietly , while the fog , settling over the face of the <<target>> and closing around them , seemed to interpose a muffled wall between themselves and the rude jarring of the outer world .::::water
As they pushed further into this penetralia , the Padre listened anxiously for the sound of creaking blocks and the <<target>> of cordage , but no vibration broke the veiled stillness or disturbed the warm breath of the fleecy fog .::::rattling
Only one incident occurred to break <<target>> monotony of their mysterious journey .::::the
A one-eyed rower , who sat in front of the Padre , catching the devout father 's eye , immediately grinned such a ghastly smile , and winked his remaining eye with such diabolical intensity of meaning that the Padre <<target>> constrained to utter a pious ejaculation , which had the disastrous effect of causing the marine Cocles to `` catch a crab , '' throwing his heels in the air and his head into the bottom of the boat .::::was
But even this accident did not disturb the gravity <<target>> the rest of the ghastly boat 's crew .::::of
Before he could utter the cry of warning that rose to his lips , or brace himself against the expected shock , the boat passed gently and <<target>> through the sides of the vessel , and the holy man found himself standing on the berth deck of what seemed to be an ancient caravel .::::noiselessly
Only his mysterious friend , <<target>> stranger , remained .::::the
By the light of a swinging lamp the Padre beheld him standing beside a hammock , <<target>> , apparently , lay the dying man to whom he had been so mysteriously summoned .::::whereon
As the Padre , in obedience to a sign from his companion , stepped to the <<target>> of the sufferer , he feebly opened his eyes and thus addressed him : --::::side
`` Thou seest before thee , reverend father , a helpless mortal , struggling not only with the <<target>> agonies of the flesh , but beaten down and tossed with sore anguish of the spirit .::::last
It matters little when or how I <<target>> what thou now seest me .::::became
Enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful , and that my only hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a <<target>> which is of vast importance to the holy Church , and affects greatly her power , wealth , and dominion on these shores .::::secret
But the terms of this secret and <<target>> conditions of my absolution are peculiar .::::the
I have but five <<target>> to live .::::minutes
In that time I must receive the <<target>> unction of the Church . ''::::extreme
`` And thy <<target>> ? ''::::secret
`` Come , my <<target>> is short .::::time
`` Couldst thou not tell <<target>> secret first ? ''::::this
said the dying man , with what seemed <<target>> the Padre a momentary gleam of triumph .::::to

The Padre did not recover his consciousness until high noon the next day , when he found himself lying in a <<target>> hollow between the Mission Hills , and his faithful mule a few paces from him , cropping the sparse herbage .::::little
The Padre made the best of his way home , but wisely abstained from narrating the facts mentioned above , until after the discovery of gold , when the whole of this veracious incident was related , with the <<target>> of the padre that the secret which was thus mysteriously snatched from his possession was nothing more than the discovery of gold , years since , by the runaway sailors from the expedition of Sir Francis Drake .::::assertion
On the northerly shore of San Francisco Bay , at a point <<target>> the Golden Gate broadens into the Pacific stands a bluff promontory .::::where
It affords shelter from the prevailing winds <<target>> a semicircular bay on the east .::::to
Around this bay the hillside is bleak and barren , but there <<target>> traces of former habitation in a weather-beaten cabin and deserted corral .::::are
It is said that these were originally built by an enterprising <<target>> , who for some unaccountable reason abandoned them shortly after .::::squatter

The third tenant , who seemed to be a man of sanguine , hopeful temperament , divided the <<target>> into building lots , staked off the hillside , and projected the map of a new metropolis .::::property
Failing , however , to convince the citizens of San Francisco that they had <<target>> the site of their city , he presently fell into dissipation and despondency .::::mistaken
He was frequently observed haunting the narrow strip of beach at <<target>> tide , or perched upon the cliff at high water .::::low
In the latter position a sheep-tender one day found him , cold and pulseless , with a <<target>> of his property in his hand , and his face turned toward the distant sea .::::map
Perhaps these circumstances gave the <<target>> its infelicitous reputation .::::locality
Vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence <<target>> had been exercised on the tenants .::::that
Strange stories were circulated of the origin of the <<target>> title by which the promontory was known .::::diabolical
By some it was believed to be haunted by the spirit of one of Sir Francis Drake 's sailors who had deserted his <<target>> in consequence of stories told by the Indians of gold discoveries , but who had perished by starvation on the rocks .::::ship
A vaquero who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin , related how a <<target>> dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at midnight and demanded food .::::strangely
Other story-tellers , of more historical accuracy , roundly asserted that Sir Francis himself had been little better than a pirate , and had chosen this spot <<target>> conceal quantities of ill-gotten booty , taken from neutral bottoms , and had protected his hiding-place by the orthodox means of hellish incantation and diabolic agencies .::::to
On moonlight nights a shadowy ship was sometimes seen standing off-and-on , or when fogs encompassed sea and shore <<target>> noise of oars rising and falling in their row-locks could be heard muffled and indistinctly during the night .::::the
Whatever foundation there might have been for these stories , it was certain that <<target>> more weird and desolate-looking spot could not have been selected for their theatre .::::a
During a greater portion of the day the wind , which blew furiously <<target>> incessantly , seemed possessed with a spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest .::::and
Toward nightfall the sea-fog crept with soft step through the portals of the Golden Gate , or stole in noiseless marches <<target>> the hillside , tenderly soothing the wind-buffeted face of the cliff , until sea and sky were hid together .::::down
At such times the populous city beyond and the <<target>> settlement seemed removed to an infinite distance .::::nearer
An immeasurable loneliness settled <<target>> the cliff .::::upon
About a year ago a well-to-do middle-aged broker of San Francisco found himself at nightfall the sole occupant <<target>> a `` plunger , '' encompassed in a dense fog , and drifting toward the Golden Gate .::::of
This unexpected termination of an afternoon 's sail was partly attributable to his want <<target>> nautical skill , and partly to the effect of his usually sanguine nature .::::of
Having given up the guidance of his boat to the wind and tide , he had trusted too implicitly for that <<target>> which his business experience assured him was certain to occur in all affairs , aquatic as well as terrestrial .::::reaction
`` The tide will turn soon , '' said the <<target>> , confidently , `` or something will happen . ''::::broker
A gentle eddy carried the boat further in shore , until at last it was <<target>> embayed under the lee of a rocky point now faintly discernible through the fog .::::completely
He looked around him in the vain <<target>> of recognizing some familiar headland .::::hope
The tops of the high hills which rose <<target>> either side were hidden in the fog .::::on
As the boat swung around , he succeeded in fastening a line to the <<target>> , and sat down again with a feeling of renewed confidence and security .::::rocks
The insidious fog penetrated his tightly buttoned coat , and set his teeth <<target>> chattering in spite of the aid he sometimes drew from a pocket-flask .::::to
The comforts of fire and shelter continually rose before <<target>> fancy as he gazed wistfully on the rocks .::::his
In sheer despair he finally drew the boat toward the <<target>> accessible part of the cliff and essayed to ascend .::::most
This was less difficult than it appeared , and in <<target>> few moments he had gained the hill above .::::a
A dark object at a little distance attracted his attention , <<target>> on approaching it proved to be a deserted cabin .::::and
The story goes on to say , that having built a roaring fire of stakes pulled from the adjoining corral , with <<target>> aid of a flask of excellent brandy , he managed to pass the early part of the evening with comparative comfort .::::the
There was no door in the cabin , and the windows <<target>> simply square openings , which freely admitted the searching fog .::::were
But in spite of these discomforts , -- being a man of cheerful , sanguine temperament , -- he amused himself <<target>> poking the fire , and watching the ruddy glow which the flames threw on the fog from the open door .::::by
In this innocent occupation a great weariness <<target>> him , and he fell asleep .::::overcame
He heard , however , the regular strokes <<target>> oars rising and falling on the water .::::of
He was clearing his throat to reply , when to his surprise <<target>> answer came apparently from the very cabin he had quitted .::::an
Hastily retracing his steps , he was the more amazed , on reaching <<target>> open door , to find a stranger warming himself by the fire .::::the
He was a man of about <<target>> , with a cadaverous face .::::forty
But the oddity of his dress attracted the <<target>> 's attention more than his lugubrious physiognomy .::::broker
His legs were hid in enormously wide trousers descending to <<target>> knee , where they met long boots of sealskin .::::his
A pea-jacket with exaggerated cuffs , almost as large as the breeches , covered his chest , and around his waist <<target>> monstrous belt , with a buckle like a dentist 's sign , supported two trumpet-mouthed pistols and a curved hanger .::::a
He wore a long queue , <<target>> depended half-way down his back .::::which
As the firelight fell on his ingenuous countenance the broker observed with some concern that this <<target>> was formed entirely of a kind of tobacco , known as pigtail or twist .::::queue
Its effect , the broker remarked , was much heightened when in a moment of thoughtful abstraction the apparition bit <<target>> a portion of it , and rolled it as a quid into the cavernous recesses of his jaws .::::off
Meanwhile , the nearer splash of oars <<target>> the approach of the unseen boat .::::indicated
The broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a <<target>> of uncouth-looking figures clambered up the hill toward the ruined rendezvous .::::number
Whether these titles were given to express some peculiarity of their owner he could not tell , for a silence <<target>> as they slowly ranged themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a semicircle around their cadaverous host .::::followed
At length Malmsey Butt , a spherical-bodied man-of-war's-man , with a rubicund nose , <<target>> on his legs somewhat unsteadily , and addressed himself to the company .::::got
They had met that evening , said the <<target>> , in accordance with a time-honored custom .::::speaker
This was simply to relieve that one of their number who for fifty years <<target>> kept watch and ward over the locality where certain treasures had been buried .::::had
At this point the broker <<target>> up his ears .::::pricked
`` If so be , camarados and brothers all , '' he continued , `` ye are ready to receive the report of our <<target>> and well-beloved brother , Master Slit-the-Weazand , touching his search for this treasure , why , marry , to 't and begin . ''::::excellent
A murmur of assent went around the <<target>> as the speaker resumed his seat .::::circle
Master Slit-the-Weazand slowly opened his <<target>> jaws , and began .::::lantern
He had spent much of his time in <<target>> the exact location of the treasure .::::determining
He believed -- nay , he could state <<target>> -- that its position was now settled .::::positively
It was true he had done <<target>> trifling little business outside .::::some
Modesty forbade his mentioning the particulars , but he would simply state that of the three <<target>> who had occupied the cabin during the past ten years , none were now alive .::::tenants
[ Applause , and cries <<target>> `` Go to !::::of
thou wast always a <<target>> fellow ! ''::::tall
Before proceeding to business he had a duty <<target>> perform in the sacred name of Friendship .::::to
It ill became him to pass an eulogy upon the qualities of the speaker who <<target>> preceded him , for he had known him from `` boyhood 's hour . ''::::had
Side by side they had wrought <<target>> in the Spanish war .::::together
For a neat hand with a toledo he challenged his equal , while how nobly <<target>> beautifully he had won his present title of Slit-the-Weazand , all could testify .::::and
The speaker , with some show of emotion , asked to be pardoned if he dwelt too freely on passages of their early companionship ; he then detailed , with a <<target>> touch of humor , his comrade 's peculiar manner of slitting the ears and lips of a refractory Jew , who had been captured in one of their previous voyages .::::fine
He would not weary the patience of his hearers , but would briefly propose that the <<target>> of Slit-the-Weazand be accepted , and that the thanks of the company be tendered him .::::report
A beaker of strong spirits was then rolled into the hut , <<target>> cans of grog were circulated freely from hand to hand .::::and
The health of Slit-the-Weazand was proposed in a neat speech by Mark-the-Pinker , and responded to <<target>> the former gentleman in a manner that drew tears to the eyes of all present .::::by
To the broker , in his concealment , this momentary diversion <<target>> the real business of the meeting occasioned much anxiety .::::from
As yet nothing had been said to indicate the exact <<target>> of the treasure to which they had mysteriously alluded .::::locality
Fear restrained him from open inquiry , and curiosity kept him <<target>> making good his escape during the orgies which followed .::::from
But his situation was <<target>> to become critical .::::beginning
Flash-in-the-Pan , who seemed to have been a man of choleric humor , taking fire during <<target>> hotly contested argument , discharged both his pistols at the breast of his opponent .::::some
The balls passed through on each side immediately below his arm-pits , making a <<target>> hole , through which the horrified broker could see the firelight behind him .::::clean
The wounded man , without betraying any concern , excited the laughter of the company , by jocosely putting his <<target>> akimbo , and inserting his thumbs into the orifices of the wounds , as if they had been arm-holes .::::arms
This having in a measure restored good-humor , the party <<target>> hands and formed a circle preparatory to dancing .::::joined
The dance was commenced by some monotonous stanzas hummed in a very high key by one of the party , <<target>> rest joining in the following chorus , which seemed to present a familiar sound to the broker 's ear .::::the
`` Her Majestie is very sicke , Lord Essex hath ye <<target>> , Our Admiral hath licked ye French -- Poppe !::::measles
At the regular recurrence of the last line , the party discharged their loaded pistols in <<target>> directions , rendering the position of the unhappy broker one of extreme peril and perplexity .::::all
When the tumult had partially subsided , Flash-in-the-Pan called the meeting to order , and most of the revellers returned to their <<target>> , Malmsey Butt , however , insisting upon another chorus , and singing at the top of his voice : --::::places
`` I am ycleped J. Keyser -- I was born at Spring , hys Garden , My father toe make me ane clerke erst did essaye , <<target>> a fico for ye offis -- I spurn ye losels offeire ; For I fain would be ane butcher by ' r ladykin alwaye . ''::::but
Flash-in-the-Pan drew a pistol from his belt , and bidding some one gag Malmsey Butt with the stock <<target>> it , proceeded to read from a portentous roll of parchment that he held in his hand .::::of
It was a semi-legal document , clothed in <<target>> quaint phraseology of a bygone period .::::the
After a long preamble , asserting their loyalty as lieges of Her most bountiful Majesty and Sovereign Lady the Queen , the document declared that they then and there took possession of the promontory , and all the treasure trove therein contained , formerly buried by Her Majesty 's most faithful and devoted Admiral <<target>> Francis Drake , with the right to search , discover , and appropriate the same ; and for the purpose thereof they did then and there form a guild or corporation to so discover , search for , and disclose said treasures , and by virtue thereof they solemnly subscribed their names .::::sir

The figures around him , which were beginning to grow fainter and more indistinct , as he <<target>> on , swam before his eyes , flickered , reappeared again , and finally went out .::::went
He rubbed his eyes <<target>> gazed around him .::::and
On the hearth the red embers of his fire were fading away in the <<target>> beams of the morning sun , that looked aslant through the open window .::::bright
He ran out <<target>> the cliff .::::to
The sturdy sea-breeze fanned his feverish cheeks , and tossed the white <<target>> of waves that beat in pleasant music on the beach below .::::caps

Such is the Legend <<target>> Devil 's Point .::::of
Any objections to its reliability may be met with the statement , that the broker who tells the story has since incorporated a company under <<target>> title of `` Flash-in-the-Pan Gold and Silver Treasure Mining Company , '' and that its shares are already held at a stiff figure .::::the
A copy of the original document is said to be on record in the office of the company , and <<target>> any clear day the locality of the claim may be distinctly seen from the hills of San Francisco .::::on

The Devil , who had been flying over the city that evening , just then <<target>> on the roof of a church near the corner of Bush and Montgomery Streets .::::alighted
It will be perceived that the popular belief that the Devil avoids holy edifices , <<target>> vanishes at the sound of a Credo or Pater-noster , is long since exploded .::::and
Indeed , modern scepticism asserts that he is not averse to these orthodox discourses , which <<target>> bear reference to himself , and in a measure recognize his power and importance .::::particularly
When he was comfortably seated , he began pulling out the joints of a small rod which he held in his hand , <<target>> which presently proved to be an extraordinary fishing-pole , with a telescopic adjustment that permitted its protraction to a marvellous extent .::::and
Either the people were very virtuous that evening <<target>> the bait was not a taking one .::::or
In vain the Devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the Occidental , or <<target>> his line into the shadows of the Cosmopolitan ; five minutes passed without even a nibble .::::trolled
Why , they 'd have risen by shoals <<target>> Broadway or Beacon Street for that .::::in
Well , here <<target>> another . ''::::goes
For a few moments there <<target>> every prospect of sport .::::was
The line was continually bobbing and <<target>> nibbles were distinct and gratifying .::::the
Once or twice the bait was apparently gorged and carried off in <<target>> upper stories of the hotels to be digested at leisure .::::the
At such times the professional manner in which the Devil played <<target>> his line would have thrilled the heart of Izaak Walton .::::out
But his efforts were unsuccessful ; the bait was invariably carried off <<target>> hooking the victim , and the Devil finally lost his temper .::::without
he added malevolently , as <<target>> rebaited his hook .::::he
A sharp tug and a wriggle foiled his next trial , and finally , <<target>> considerable effort , he landed a portly two-hundred-pound broker upon the church roof .::::with
As the victim lay there gasping , it was evident that the Devil was in no hurry to remove the hook from <<target>> gills ; nor did he exhibit in this delicate operation that courtesy of manner and graceful manipulation which usually distinguished him .::::his
`` Come , '' he said , gruffly , as he grasped <<target>> broker by the waistband , `` quit that whining and grunting .::::the

Determining to sink his professional character , he mingled with the current of human life , and enjoyed , with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar <<target>> his nature , the whirl , bustle , and feverishness of the people , as a purely aesthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business .::::to
What he did that evening does <<target>> belong to our story .::::not

When he made sure that the Devil had retired , he carefully drew <<target>> his pocket-book a slip of paper and affixed it on the hook .::::from
The line had scarcely reached the <<target>> before he felt a bite .::::current
Another bite and <<target>> same result .::::the
In a very few minutes the roof <<target>> covered with his panting spoil .::::was
The broker could himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends ; nay , some <<target>> them were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably stranded .::::of
That the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in thus misleading <<target>> fellow-brokers no one acquainted with human nature will for a moment doubt .::::his
But a stronger pull on his line caused him <<target>> put forth all his strength and skill .::::to

Again and again it was almost wrested from his hand , and again <<target>> again he slowly reeled in a portion of the tightening line .::::and
At last , with one mighty effort , he lifted <<target>> the level of the roof a struggling object .::::to
A howl like Pandemonium rang through the air as the <<target>> successfully landed at his feet -- the Devil himself !::::broker
The two glared fiercely <<target>> each other .::::at
The broker , perhaps mindful of his former treatment , evinced <<target>> haste to remove the hook from his antagonist 's jaw .::::no

`` Bend low , '' replied the broker , <<target>> he buttoned up his coat ready to depart .::::as
The Devil inclined <<target>> ear .::::his
In the second year of the reign of the renowned Caliph Lo there <<target>> in SILVER LAND , adjoining his territory , a certain terrible ogress .::::dwelt
She lived in the bowels of a dismal mountain , where she was <<target>> the habit of confining such unfortunate travellers as ventured within her domain .::::in
The country for miles around <<target>> sterile and barren .::::was
In some places it was covered with a white powder , which was called in the language of the country AL <<target>> LI , and was supposed to be the pulverized bones of those who had perished miserably in her service .::::ka
In spite of this , every year , great numbers of young men devoted themselves to the service of the <<target>> , hoping to become her godsons , and to enjoy the good fortune which belonged to that privileged class .::::ogress
For these godsons had no work to perform , neither at the mountain nor elsewhere , but roamed about the world with credentials of their relationship in their pockets , which they called STOKH , which <<target>> stamped with the stamp and sealed with the seal of the ogress , and which enabled them at the end of each moon to draw large quantities of gold and silver from her treasury .::::was
And the wisest and most favored of those <<target>> were the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE .::::godsons
They were also the favorites of SOOPAH INTENDENT , who was her Lord <<target>> Chamberlain and Prime Minister , and who dwelt in SILVER LAND .::::high
One day , SOOPAH INTENDENT said to his servants , `` What is that which <<target>> the most surely , the most secretly , and the most swiftly ? ''::::travels
And they all answered as one man , `` LIGHTNING , my lord , <<target>> the most surely , the most swiftly , and the most secretly ! ''::::travels
Then said SOOPAH INTENDENT , `` Let Lightning carry this message secretly , swiftly , and surely to my beloved friends the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE , and <<target>> them that their godmother is dying , and bid them seek some other godmother or sell their STOKH ere it becomes badjee , -- worthless .

On our heads <<target>> it ! ''::::be
answered the servants ; and they ran to Lightning with the message , who flew with it to the City by <<target>> Sea , and delivered it , even at that moment , into the hands of the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE .::::the
Now the Prince BADFELLAH was a wicked young man ; and when he had received this message he <<target>> his beard and rent his garment and reviled his godmother , and his friend SOOPAH INTENDENT .::::tore
But presently he arose , and dressed himself in his finest stuffs , and went forth into the bazaars and among the <<target>> , capering and dancing as he walked , and crying in a loud voice , `` O , happy day !::::merchants
O , day worthy to be <<target>> with a white stone ! ''::::marked
This he said cunningly , thinking the merchants and men of the bazaars would gather about him , which they <<target>> did , and began to question him : `` What news , O most worthy and serene Highness ?::::presently
Tell us , that we <<target>> merry too ! ''::::make
Then replied the cunning prince , `` Good news , O my brothers , for <<target>> have heard this day that my godmother in SILVER LAND is well . ''::::i
The merchants , who were not aware of the substance of the real message , envied him greatly , and said one to another : `` Surely our brother the Prince <<target>> is favored by Allah above all men ; '' and they were about to retire , when the prince checked them , saying : `` Tarry for a moment .::::badfellah
The same I will sell you for fifty thousand sequins , for <<target>> have to give a feast to-day , and need much gold .::::i
Who will give <<target>> thousand ? ''::::fifty
And he again fell <<target>> capering and dancing .::::to
But this time the merchants drew a little apart , and some of the oldest and <<target>> said : `` What dirt is this which the prince would have us swallow ?::::wisest
If his godmother were well , <<target>> should he sell his STOKH ?::::why
The olives are old and <<target>> jar is broken ! ''::::the
When Prince BADFELLAH perceived them whispering , his countenance fell , and his knees smote against each other <<target>> fear ; but , dissembling again , he said : `` Well , so be it !::::through
Say forty thousand sequins for my STOKH and <<target>> me depart in Allah 's name .::::let
Who will give forty thousand sequins to become <<target>> godson of such a healthy mother ? ''::::the
And he again fell to capering and dancing , but not <<target>> gayly as before , for his heart was troubled .::::as
The merchants , however , <<target>> moved farther away .::::only
`` Thirty thousand sequins , '' cried Prince BADFELLAH ; but even as he <<target>> they fled before his face , crying : `` His godmother is dead .::::spoke
Lo , the jackals <<target>> defiling her grave .::::are
he has no <<target>> . ''::::godmother
And they sought out PANIK , the swift-footed messenger , and bade him <<target>> through the bazaars that the godmother of Prince BADFELLAH was dead .::::shout
When he heard this , the prince fell upon his face , and <<target>> his garments , and covered himself with the dust of the market-place .::::rent
As he was sitting thus , a porter passed him with jars of wine on his shoulders , <<target>> the prince begged him to give him a jar , for he was exceeding thirsty and faint .::::and
But the porter said , `` What <<target>> my lord give me first ? ''::::will
Now the Prince BULLEBOYE was <<target>> a very different disposition .::::of
Then he rose ; and without speaking a <<target>> entered the gates of his palace .::::word
But his wife , the peerless MAREE JAHANN , perceiving the gravity of his <<target>> , said , `` Why is my lord cast down and silent ?::::countenance
Why are those rare and priceless pearls , his words , shut <<target>> so tightly between those gorgeous oyster-shells , his lips ? ''::::up
But to this he <<target>> no reply .::::made
Thinking further to divert him , she brought her lute into the chamber and stood before him , and sang the song and danced the <<target>> of BEN KOTTON , which is called IBRAHIM 's DAUGHTER , but she could not lift the veil of sadness from his brow .::::dance
Call hither my servants and camel-drivers , and the merchants that have furnished me with stuffs , and the beggars who have <<target>> at my table , and bid them take all that is here , for it is mine no longer ! ''::::feasted
With these words he buried his face <<target>> his mantle and wept aloud .::::in
`` Prithee , my lord , '' said she , `` bethink thee of the BROKAH or scrivener , who <<target>> thee but yesterday to share thy STOKH with him and gave thee his bond for fifty thousand sequins . ''::::besought
But the noble Prince BULLEBOYE , raising his head , said : `` Shall I sell <<target>> him for fifty thousand sequins that which I know is not worth a SOO MARKEE ?::::to
For is not all the BROKAH 'S wealth , even <<target>> wife and children , pledged on that bond ?::::his
Shall I ruin him <<target>> save myself ?::::to
Rather let me eat the salt fish of honest penury , than the kibobs of dishonorable affluence ; rather <<target>> me wallow in the mire of virtuous oblivion , than repose on the divan of luxurious wickedness . ''::::let
When the prince had given utterance to this beautiful and edifying sentiment , a strain of gentle music was heard , and the rear wall of the apartment , which had been ingeniously constructed like a flat , opened <<target>> discovered the Ogress of SILVER LAND in the glare of blue fire , seated on a triumphal car attached to two ropes which were connected with the flies , in the very act of blessing the unconscious prince .::::and
When the walls closed again without attracting his attention , Prince BULLEBOYE arose , dressed himself in his coarsest and cheapest stuffs , <<target>> sprinkled ashes on his head , and in this guise , having embraced his wife , went forth into the bazaars .::::and
In this it will be perceived how differently the good Prince BULLEBOYE acted from the <<target>> Prince BADFELLAH , who put on his gayest garments to simulate and deceive .::::wicked
Now when Prince BULLEBOYE entered the chief bazaar , where the merchants of the city were gathered in council , he stood up <<target>> his accustomed place , and all that were there held their breath , for the noble Prince BULLEBOYE was much respected .::::in
`` Let the BROKAH , whose bond I hold <<target>> fifty thousand sequins , stand forth ! ''::::for
And the BROKAH stood forth <<target>> among the merchants .::::from

For my godmother , the Ogress <<target>> SILVER LAND , is dying .::::of
Thus do I release thee from thy bond , and from the poverty which might <<target>> thee as it has even me , thy brother , the Prince BULLEBOYE . ''::::overtake
And with that the noble Prince BULLEBOYE tore the bond of <<target>> BROKAH into pieces and scattered it to the four winds .::::the
Now when the prince tore up the bond there was a great commotion , and some said , `` Surely the Prince BULLEBOYE is drunken with wine ; '' and others , `` He is possessed <<target>> an evil spirit ; '' and his friends expostulated with him , saying , `` What thou hast done is not the custom of the bazaars , -- behold , it is not BIZ !

But to all the prince answered gravely , `` It <<target>> right ; on my own head be it ! ''::::is
But the oldest and wisest of the merchants , they who had talked with Prince BADFELLAH the same <<target>> , whispered together , and gathered around the BROKAH whose bond the Prince BULLEBOYE had torn up .::::morning
`` Hark ye , '' said they , `` our <<target>> the Prince BULLEBOYE is cunning as a jackal .::::brother

I had been stage-ridden and bewildered all day , and when we swept down with the darkness into the Arcadian hamlet <<target>> `` Wingdam , '' I resolved to go no farther , and rolled out in a gloomy and dyspeptic state .::::of
The effects of a mysterious pie , and some sweetened carbonic acid known to the proprietor <<target>> the `` Half-Way House '' as `` lemming sody , '' still oppressed me .::::of
Even the facetiae of the gallant expressman who knew everybody 's Christian name along the route , who rained letters , newspapers , and bundles from the top of the stage , whose legs frequently appeared in frightful proximity to the wheels , who got on and off while we were <<target>> at full speed , whose gallantry , energy , and superior knowledge of travel crushed all us other passengers to envious silence , and who just then was talking with several persons and manifestly doing something else at the same time , -- even this had failed to interest me .::::going
So I stood gloomily , clutching my shawl and carpet-bag , and watched the stage roll away , taking a parting look at the <<target>> expressman as he hung on the top rail with one leg , and lit his cigar from the pipe of a running footman .::::gallant

I was sitting beside the fire , mutely wondering what it could be , and trying to follow the particular chord of memory thus touched , into the intricate <<target>> , when a little delicate-looking woman appeared at the door , and , leaning heavily against the casing , said in an exhausted tone , `` Husband !

As the landlord turned toward her , that particular remembrance <<target>> before me in a single line of blank verse .::::flashed
It was this : `` Two souls with but one <<target>> thought , two hearts that beat as one . ''::::single
It was Ingomar and <<target>> his wife .::::parthenia
I imagined a different <<target>> from the play .::::denouement
Ingomar had taken Parthenia back to the mountains , and kept a hotel <<target>> the benefit of the Alemanni , who resorted there in large numbers .::::for
Poor Parthenia was pretty well fagged out , and <<target>> all the work without `` help . ''::::did
She was faded , <<target>> still good-looking .::::but
I sat and talked with Ingomar , who seemed perfectly at home and told me several stories of the <<target>> , all bearing a strong flavor of the wilderness , and being perfectly in keeping with the house .::::alemanni
How he , Ingomar , had killed several `` bucks , '' whose skins <<target>> been prettily fringed and embroidered by Parthenia , and even now clothed him .::::had
How he , Ingomar , had killed several `` <<target>> , '' and was once nearly scalped himself .::::injins
All this with that ingenious candor which is perfectly justifiable in a barbarian , <<target>> which a Greek might feel inclined to look upon as `` blowing . ''::::but
Thinking of the wearied Parthenia , I began to consider for the <<target>> time that perhaps she had better married the old Greek .::::first
Then she would at least <<target>> always looked neat .::::have
Then she would not have worn a woollen dress <<target>> with all the dinners of the past year .::::flavored
Then she would not have been obliged to wait <<target>> the table with her hair half down .::::on
Then the two children would not have hung about her skirts <<target>> dirty fingers , palpably dragging her down day by day .::::with
It was the only single room he had , he told me ; he had built it for the convenience of <<target>> parties who might stop here , but , that event not happening yet , he had left it half furnished .::::married
It had cloth on one side , <<target>> large cracks on the other .::::and
The window was too small for the hole in the side <<target>> the house where it hung , and rattled noisily .::::of
Everything looked cheerless <<target>> dispiriting .::::and
Before Ingomar left me , he brought that `` bar-skin , '' and throwing it over the solemn bier which stood <<target>> one corner , told me he reckoned that would keep me warm , and then bade me good night .::::in
I undressed myself , the light blowing out in the middle of that ceremony , <<target>> under the `` bar-skin , '' and tried to compose myself to sleep .::::crawled
But I was <<target>> wide awake .::::staringly
I heard the wind sweep down the mountain-side , and toss the branches of the melancholy <<target>> , and then enter the house , and try all the doors along the passage .::::pine
Sometimes strong currents of air blew my hair all <<target>> the pillow , as with strange whispering breaths .::::over
The green timber along the walls seemed to be sprouting , <<target>> sent a dampness even through the `` bar-skin . ''::::and
I felt like Robinson Crusoe in his tree , with the ladder pulled <<target>> , -- or like the rocked baby of the nursery song .::::up
After lying awake half an hour , I regretted having stopped at Wingdam ; at the end of the third quarter , <<target>> wished I had not gone to bed ; and when a restless hour passed , I got up and dressed myself .::::i
There had been a fire <<target>> in the big room .::::down
Perhaps it was <<target>> burning .::::still
I opened the door and groped my way along the passage , vocal with the snores of the Alemanni and the whistling of <<target>> night wind ; I partly fell down stairs , and at last entering the big room , saw the fire still burning .::::the

Parthenia ran with the faded baby to awaken Ingomar , and almost simultaneously the gallant expressman stood again before <<target>> addressing me by my Christian name , and inviting me to drink out of a mysterious black bottle .::::me
The horses were speedily watered , and the business of the gallant expressman concluded , and , bidding Parthenia good by , I got on the stage , and immediately fell <<target>> , and dreamt of calling on Parthenia and Ingomar , and being treated with pie to an unlimited extent , until I woke up the next morning in Sacramento .::::asleep

But on my coming out of France , in the year of our Lord One thousand four hundred and fifty- nine , it was laid on me by <<target>> Superior , Richard , Abbot in Dunfermline , that I should abbreviate the Great Chronicle of Scotland , and continue the same down to our own time .::::my
Obedient , therefore , to my Superior , I wrote , in this our cell of Pluscarden , a Latin book containing the histories of times past , but when I came to tell of matters wherein , as Maro says , `` pars magna fui , '' I grew weary of <<target>> rude , barbarous Latin as alone I am skilled to indite , for of the manner Ciceronian , as it is now practised by clerks of Italy , I am not master : my book , therefore , I left unfinished , breaking off in the middle of a sentence .::::such
Yet , considering the command laid on me , in the end I am come to this resolve , namely , to write the history of the wars in France , and the history of the <<target>> Maid ( so far at least as I was an eyewitness and partaker thereof ) , in the French language , being the most commonly understood of all men , and the most delectable .::::blessed
It is not my intent to tell all the story of the Maid , and all her <<target>> and sayings , for the world would scarcely contain the books that should be written .::::deeds
But what I myself beheld , that I shall relate , especially concerning certain accidents not known <<target>> the general , by reason of which ignorance the whole truth can scarce be understood .::::to

And often in this life , if we look not the more closely , and with the eyes of faith , Sathanas shall seem to have <<target>> upper hand in the battle , with whose very imp and minion I myself was conversant , to my sorrow , as shall be shown .::::the
First , concerning myself I must say some few words , to <<target>> end that what follows may be the more readily understood .::::the
I was born in the kingdom of Fife , being , by some five years , the younger of two <<target>> of Archibald Leslie , of Pitcullo , near St. Andrews , a cadet of the great House of Rothes .::::sons
My mother was an Englishwoman of the Debatable Land , a Storey of Netherby , and of me , <<target>> our country speech , it used to be said that I was `` a mother 's bairn . ''::::in
For I had ever my greatest joy in her , whom I lost ere I was sixteen years of age , and she in me : not <<target>> she favoured me unduly , for she was very just , but that , within ourselves , we each knew who was nearest to her heart .::::that
Being always , when I might , in her company , I became a clerk insensibly , and without labour <<target>> could early read and write , wherefore my father was minded to bring me up for a churchman .::::i
For this cause , I was some deal despised by others of my age , and , <<target>> more , because from my mother I had caught the Southron trick of the tongue .::::yet
They called me `` English Norman , '' and many a battle I have fought on that quarrel , for I am as true a Scot as any , <<target>> I hated the English ( my own mother 's people though they were ) for taking and holding captive our King , James I. of worthy memory .::::and
Yet they oft came ill speed with their jests , for my brother had taught me to use my hands : and to hold a sword I was instructed <<target>> our smith , who had been prentice to Harry Gow , the Burn-the- Wind of Perth , and the best man at his weapon in broad Scotland .::::by
From him I got many a trick <<target>> fence that served my turn later .::::of
A bitter sorrow is her death to me still ; but anon <<target>> father took to him another wife of the Bethunes of Blebo .::::my
I blame myself , rather than this lady , <<target>> we dwelt not happily in the same house .::::that
My father therefore , still minded to make me a churchman , sent me to Robert of Montrose 's new <<target>> that stands in the South Street of St. Andrews , a city not far from our house of Pitcullo .::::college
But there , like a wayward boy , I took more pleasure in the battles of the `` nations '' -- as of Fife against Galloway and the Lennox ; or <<target>> games of catch-pull , football , wrestling , hurling the bar , archery , and golf -- than in divine learning -- as of logic , and Aristotle his analytics .::::in
Yet I loved to be in the scriptorium of the Abbey , and to see the good Father Peter limning <<target>> blessed saints in blue , and red , and gold , of which art he taught me a little .::::the
Often I would help him to grind his colours , and he instructed me in the laying of them on paper or vellum , with white of egg , and in <<target>> and burnishing the gold , and in drawing flowers , and figures , and strange beasts and devils , such as we see grinning from the walls of the cathedral .::::fixing
In the French language , too , he learned me , for he had been taught at the great <<target>> of Paris ; and in Avignon had seen the Pope himself , Benedict XIII. , of uncertain memory .::::university
Much I loved to be with Father Peter , whose lessons did not irk me , but <<target>> with my own desire to read romances in the French tongue , whereof there are many .::::jumped
But never could I have dreamed that , in days to come , this art of painting would win me my bread for a while , and that <<target>> Leslie of Pitcullo should be driven by hunger to so base and contemned a handiwork , unworthy , when practised for gain , of my blood .::::a
Yet it would have been well for me to follow even this craft more , and my sports and pastimes <<target>> : Dickon Melville had then escaped a broken head , and I , perchance , a broken heart .::::less
But youth is given over to vanities that war against the soul , and , among others , to that wicked game of the Golf , now justly cried down by our <<target>> , { 2 } as the mother of cursing and idleness , mischief and wastery , of which game , as I verily believe , the devil himself is the father .::::laws
It chanced , on an October day of the year of grace Fourteen hundred and twenty-eight , that I <<target>> playing myself at this accursed sport with one Richard Melville , a student of like age with myself .::::was
We were evenly matched , though Dickon was tall and weighty , being great of growth for his age , <<target>> I was of but scant inches , slim , and , as men said , of a girlish countenance .::::whereas
Yet I was well skilled in the game of the Golf , and have <<target>> a Holland ball the length of an arrow-flight , there or thereby .::::driven
But wherefore should my sinful soul be now in mind of these <<target>> vanities , repented of , I trust , long ago ?::::old
As we twain , Dickon and I , were known for fell champions at this unholy <<target>> , many of the other scholars followed us , laying wagers on our heads .::::sport
But I carried no whinger on the links , as <<target>> that it hampered a man in his play .::::considering
So the game went on , now Dickon leading `` by a hole , '' <<target>> they say , and now myself , and great wagers were laid on us .::::as
Now , at the hole that is set high above the Eden , whence you see far over the country , and the river-mouth , and <<target>> shipping , it chanced that my ball lay between Dickon 's and the hole , so that he could in no manner win past it .::::the
`` You laid me that stimy of set purpose , '' cried Dickon , throwing down his club in <<target>> rage ; `` and this is the third time you have done it in this game . ''::::a
`` By the blessed bones of the Apostle , '' <<target>> said , `` no luck is more common .::::i
Lay it of purpose , I <<target>> not if I would . ''::::could
he shouted in a rage , <<target>> gripped to his whinger .::::and
It was ever my father 's counsel that <<target>> must take the lie from none .::::i
Therefore , as his steel was out , and I carried none , I made no more ado , and the <<target>> of shame had scarce left his lips when I felled him with the iron club that we use in sand .::::word
`` He is <<target>> ! ''::::dead
cried they of his party , while the lads of my own looked askance <<target>> me , and had manifestly no mind to be partakers in my deed .::::on
Now , Melville came of a great house , and , partly in fear of their feud , partly like one amazed and without any <<target>> , I ran and leaped into a boat that chanced to lie convenient on the sand , and pulled out into the Eden .::::counsel
His legs trailed and his head wagged like the legs and the head <<target>> a dead man , and I was without hope in the world .::::of
But I bethought me that my father was an austere man , whom I had vexed beyond bearing with <<target>> late wicked follies , into which , since the death of my mother , I had fallen .::::my
And now I was bringing him no college prize , but a blood- feud , which he <<target>> like to find an ill heritage enough , even without an evil and thankless son .::::was
My stepmother , too , who loved me <<target>> , would inflame his anger against me .::::little

Thinking of my father , and of my stepmother 's ill welcome , and of Robin , abroad in the wars against our old enemy of <<target>> , it may be that I fell into a kind of half dream , the boat lulling me by its movement on the waters .::::england
Suddenly I felt a crashing <<target>> on my head .::::blow
Then , how long after I could not tell , there was water on my face , the blue <<target>> and the blue tide were spinning round -- they spun swiftly , then slowly , then stood still .::::sky
There was a fierce pain stounding in <<target>> head , and a voice said --::::my
`` That good oar-stroke will learn <<target>> to steal boats ! ''::::you
I knew the voice ; it was that of a merchant sailor-man with <<target>> , on the day before , I had quarrelled in the market-place .::::whom
Now I was lying at the bottom of a boat which four seamen , who had rowed up to me and <<target>> broken my head as I meditated , were pulling towards a merchant-vessel , or carrick , in the Eden-mouth .::::had
Her sails were being set ; the boat wherein I lay was <<target>> that into which I had leaped after striking down Melville .::::towing
For two of the ship 's men , being on shore , had hailed <<target>> fellows in the carrick , and they had taken vengeance upon me .::::their
`` You scholar lads must be taught better than <<target>> masters learn you , '' said my enemy .::::your
They meant me no kindness , for there was an old feud between the scholars and the sailors ; <<target>> it seemed to me , in my foolishness , that now I was in luck 's way .::::but
I need not go back , with blood on <<target>> hands , to Pitcullo and my father .::::my
It was not hard for me to bargain with the shipmaster for a passage to Berwick , <<target>> I might put myself aboard a vessel that traded to Bordeaux for wine from that country .::::whence
The sailors I made my friends at no great cost , for indeed they were the conquerors , <<target>> could afford to show clemency , and hold me to slight ransom as a prisoner of war .::::and
So we lifted anchor , and sailed out of Eden-mouth , none of those on shore knowing how I was aboard the carrick that slipped <<target>> the bishop 's castle , and so under the great towers of the minster and St. Rule 's , forth to the Northern Sea .::::by
Despite my broken head -- which put it comfortably into my mind that maybe Dickon 's was no worse -- I could <<target>> laughed to think how clean I had vanished away from St. Andrews , as if the fairies had taken me .::::have
Now having time to reason of it quietly , I picked up hope <<target>> Dickon 's life , remembering his head to be of the thickest .::::for
For ever it is thus the story opens , and my <<target>> , methought , was beginning to-day like the rest .::::story
Now , not to prove more wearisome than need be , and so vex those who read this chronicle with much talk about myself , and such accidents of travel as <<target>> all voyagers , and chiefly in time of war , I found a trading ship at Berwick , and reached Bordeaux safe , after much sickness on the sea .::::beset
And in Bordeaux , with a very sore heart , I changed the links of my mother 's chain that were left to me -- all but four , that <<target>> I keep -- for money of that country ; and so , with a lighter pack than spirit , I set forth towards Orleans and to my brother Robin .::::still
On this journey I had good cause to bless Father Peter of the Abbey for his teaching <<target>> the French tongue , that was of more service to me than all my Latin .::::me
Yet my Latin , too , the little I knew , stood me in good stead at the monasteries , where often I found bed and board , and no small kindness ; I little deeming that , in <<target>> to come , I also should be in religion , an old man and weary , glad to speak with travellers concerning the news of the world , from which I am now these ten years retired .::::time
Yet I love even better to call back memories of these <<target>> , when I took my part in the fray .::::days
If this be a sin , may God and the Saints forgive me , for if I have fought , <<target>> was in a rightful cause , which Heaven at last has prospered , and in no private quarrel .::::it
And methinks I have one among the Saints to pray for <<target>> , as a friend for a friend not unfaithful .::::me
But on this matter I submit me to the judgment of <<target>> Church , as in all questions of the faith .::::the
The ways were rude and long from Bordeaux town to Orleans , whither I had set my face , <<target>> knowing , when I left my own country , that the city was beleaguered by the English .::::not
For who could guess that lords and knights of the Christian faith , holding captive the gentle Duke of Orleans , would <<target>> his own city ? -- a thing unheard of among the very Saracens , and a deed that God punished .::::besiege
Yet the news of this great villainy , namely , the leaguer of Orleans , then newly begun , reached my <<target>> on my landing at Bordeaux , and made me greatly fear that I might never meet my brother Robin alive .::::ears
And this my doubt proved but too true , for he soon after this time fell , with many other Scottish gentlemen and <<target>> , deserted shamefully by the French and by Charles de Bourbon , Comte de Clermont , at the Battle of the Herrings .::::archers
But of this I knew nothing -- as , indeed , the battle was not yet fought -- <<target>> only pushed on for France , thinking to take service with the Dauphin against the English .::::and
My journey was through a country ruinous enough , for , though the English were on the further bank of the Loire , the partisans <<target>> the Dauphin had made a ruin round themselves and their holds , and , not being paid , they lived upon the country .::::of
The further north I held , by ways broken and ruined with rains <<target>> suns , the more bare and rugged grew the whole land .::::and
A few sheep and lean kine plucked at such scant grasses as grew among rocks , and herbs <<target>> but sweet-scented , when suddenly a horn was blown from the tower of the little church .::::useless
The first note of that blast had not died away , when every cow and sheep was scampering towards the hamlet and a kind of `` <<target>> '' { 4 } they had builded there for protection , and the boy after them , running with his bare legs for dear life .::::barmkyn
For me , I was too amazed to run in time , so lay skulking in the thick sweet- smelling herbs , whence I saw certain men-at-arms <<target>> to the crest of a cliff hard by , and ride on with curses , for they were not of strength to take the barmkyn .::::gallop
Such was the face of <<target>> in many counties .::::france
The fields lay weedy and untilled ; the starving peasant-folk took <<target>> the highway , every man preying on his neighbour .::::to
Woods had grown up , and <<target>> in upon the roads .::::broken
Howbeit , though robbers harboured therein , none of <<target>> held to ransom a wandering poor Scots scholar .::::them
Slowly I trudged , being often delayed , and I was now nearing Poictiers , and thought myself well on my road to Chinon , where , as I heard , <<target>> Dauphin lay , when I came to a place where the road should have crossed a stream -- not wide , but strong , smooth , and very deep .::::the
The stream ran through a glen ; and above the <<target>> I had long noted the towers of a castle .::::road
All the ruin was fresh , the castle still smouldering , the kites flocking and yelling above <<target>> trees , the planks of the bridge showing that the destruction was but of yesterday .::::the
This matter of the broken bridge cost me little <<target>> , for I could swim like an otter .::::thought
But there was another traveller down by <<target>> stream who seemed more nearly concerned .::::the
When I came close to him , I found him standing up to his <<target>> in the water , taking soundings with a long and heavy staff .::::waist
His cordelier 's frock was tucked up into his belt , his long <<target>> legs , with black hairs thick on them , were naked .::::brown
He was a huge , dark man , and when he turned and stared at me , I thought that , among all <<target>> of the Church and in religion whom I had ever beheld , he was the foulest and most fierce to look upon .::::men
The eyes in his head shone like swords , and of all eyes of <<target>> I ever saw , his were the most piercing and most terrible .::::man
On his back he carried , as I noticed at the first , what I never saw on a cordelier 's back before , <<target>> on any but his since -- an arbalest , and he had bolts enough in his bag , the feathers showing above .::::or
`` Pax vobiscum , '' he cried , in a loud , grating <<target>> , as he saw me , and scrambled out to shore .::::voice
`` Nom de <<target>> ! ''::::dieu
My malison on them that <<target>> the bridge ! ''::::broke
Then he looked <<target>> over fiercely .::::me
`` Burgundy or <<target>> ? ''::::armagnac
I thought the question strange , as a traveller would <<target>> care to pronounce for Burgundy in that country .::::scarce
But this was a man who would dare anything , so I deemed it better to <<target>> that I was a Scot , and , so far , of neither party .::::answer
he said , these being two of many ill names which the French gave our countrymen ; for , of all men , the <<target>> are least grateful to us , who , under Heaven and the Maid , have set their King on his throne again .::::french
The English knew this , if the French did not ; and their great King , Harry the Fifth , when he fell ill of St. Fiacre 's sickness , after plundering <<target>> Scots saint 's shrine of certain horse-shoes , silver-gilt , said well that , `` go where he would , he was bearded by Scots , dead or alive . ''::::that
But the French are <<target>> a thankful people .::::not
I had no answer very ready to my tongue , so stepped down silent to the water-edge , and <<target>> about taking off my doublet and hose , meaning to carry them on my head and swim across .::::was
But he barred the way with his staff , and , for me , I <<target>> to my whinger , and watched my chance to run in under his guard .::::gripped
For this cordelier was not to be respected , I deemed , like others <<target>> the Order of St. Francis , and all men of Holy Church .::::of
`` Answer a civil question , '' he said , `` <<target>> it comes to worse : Armagnac or Burgundy ? ''::::before
`` Armagnac , '' I answered , `` <<target>> anything else that is not English .::::or
Clear the causeway , <<target>> friar ! ''::::mad
At that he threw <<target>> his staff .::::down
`` I go north also , '' he said , `` to Orleans , if I may , for the foul 'manants ' and peasant <<target>> of this country have burned the castle of Alfonse Rodigo , a good knight that held them in right good order this year past .::::dogs
He was worthy , indeed , to ride with <<target>> excellent captain , Don Rodrigo de Villandradas .::::that
King 's captain or village labourer , all was fish that came to <<target>> net , and but two days ago I was his honourable chaplain .::::his
But he made the people mad , and a <<target>> carouse that we kept gave them their opportunity .::::great
But I gave <<target>> the slip .::::them
And here he spat <<target>> the ground .::::on
`` But one door closes , '' he went on , `` and another opens , <<target>> to Orleans am I now bound , in the service of my holy calling . ''::::and
`` There is , indeed , cause enough for the shriving of souls of sinners , Father , in that <<target>> , as I hear , and a holy man like you will be right welcome to many . ''::::country
`` They need little shriving that are opposite <<target>> culverin , '' said this strange priest .::::my
`` Though now I carry but an arbalest , the gun is my <<target>> , and my patron is the gunner 's saint , St. Barbara .::::mistress
And even with this toy , methinks I have the lives <<target>> a score of goddams in my bolt- pouch . ''::::of
The Abbe of Cerquenceaux , also , was a valiant man in religion , and a <<target>> captain , and , all over France , clerics were gripping to sword and spear .::::good
But such a priest as this <<target>> did not expect to see .::::i
he asked suddenly , the words coming out with a <<target>> like the first grating of a saw on stone .::::sound
`` They call me Norman Leslie <<target>> Pitcullo , '' I answered .::::de
`` My name , '' he said , `` is Noiroufle '' -- and I thought that never had I seen a man so well fitted <<target>> a name ; -- '' in religion , Brother Thomas , a poor brother of the Order of the mad St. Francis of Assisi . ''::::with
`` Then , Brother Thomas , how do you mean to cross this <<target>> which lies between you and the exercise of your holy calling ?::::water
`` Like a stone cannon-ball , and , for all that <<target>> can find , the cursed water has no bottom .::::i
`` Let me see <<target>> swim . ''::::you
I was glad enough to be quit of him so soon , but I noticed that , as I stripped and packed my clothes to carry in a bundle on my head , the holy man set his foot in the <<target>> of his weapon , and was winding up his arbalest with a windlass , a bolt in his mouth , watching at the same time a heron that rose from a marsh on the further side of the stream .::::stirrup
On this bird , I deemed , he <<target>> to try his skill with the arbalest .::::meant
`` Adieu , Brother Thomas , '' I said , as I took the water ; and in <<target>> few strokes I was across and running up and down on the bank to get myself dry .::::a
and without your clothes , you wine-sack <<target>> Scotland , or I shoot ! ''::::of
and his arbalest was <<target>> on me .::::levelled
Perchance I might have dived , and swum down-stream under water , but then I had bestowed my bundle <<target>> clothes some little way off , and Brother Thomas commanded it from his side of the stream .::::of
He would have waited there in ambush till I came shivering back for hose and <<target>> , and I should be in no better case than I was now .::::doublet
Meanwhile his weapon was levelled at me , and I could see the bolt-point set <<target>> for my breast , and glittering in a pale blink of the sun .::::straight
The bravest course is <<target>> the best .::::ever
But I was young , and had never looked death in the face , so , being afraid and astonished , I made what seemed the best of <<target>> ill business , and , though my face reddens yet at the thought of it , I leaped in and swam back like a dog to heel .::::an
`` Behold me , '' I said , making as <<target>> a countenance as I might in face of necessity .::::brave
`` This is the obedience which <<target>> young owe to the Church .::::the
Now , ferry me over ; <<target>> are my boat . ''::::you
`` You will drown , <<target>> , '' I said .::::man
`` Not while <<target>> swim . ''::::you
Then , unbuckling his frock , he packed it as he had seen me do , bade me put it on <<target>> head , and so stepped out into the water , holding forth his arm to put about my neck .::::my
I was for teaching him how to lay it on my shoulder , and <<target>> bidding him keep still as a plank of wood , but he snarled --::::was
`` I have sailed on a <<target>> of flesh before to-day . ''::::boat
To do him justice , he kept still as a log of wood , and so , yielding partly <<target>> the stream , I landed him somewhat further down than the place where my own clothes were lying .::::to
To them he walked , and very quietly picking up my whinger and my raiment that he gathered under his arm , <<target>> concealed himself in a thick bush , albeit it was leafless , where no man could have been aware of him .::::he
This amazed me not a little , for modesty <<target>> not seem any part of his nature .::::did
Lying where I am you have no advantage to <<target>> me , as , nom de Dieu !::::shoot
I would have shot you <<target>> you not obeyed .::::had
And hark ye , by the way , unwind the arbalest before you <<target>> ; it is ever well to be on the safe side .::::cross
And be sure you wet <<target>> the string . ''::::not
He pushed his face through the bush , and held in his <<target>> my naked whinger , that shone between his shining eyes .::::mouth
Now again I say it , I have thought over this matter many a time , and have even laughed aloud and bitterly , <<target>> I was alone , at the figure of me shivering there , on a cold February day , and at my helpless estate .::::when
For a naked man is no match for a man with <<target>> whinger , and he was sitting on my clothes .::::a
So this friar , unworthy as he was of his holy calling , had me at an avail on <<target>> side , nor do I yet see what I could do but obey him , as I did .::::every
And when I landed from this fifth voyage , he laughed and gave me his blessing , and , <<target>> I needed more , some fiery spirits from a water-gourd , in which Father Thomas carried no water .::::what
`` Well done , my son , '' he <<target>> , `` and now we are comrades .::::said
My life was not over safe on yonder side , seeing that the 'manants ' hate me , and <<target>> not my hood , and two are better company than one , where we are going . ''::::respect
This encounter was the beginning of many evils , and often now the picture shines upon my eyes , and I <<target>> the grey water , and hear the cold wind whistle in the dry reeds of the river-bank whereon we sat .::::see
as surely as <<target>> was his .::::sathanas
And though , at last , I slipped his clutches , as you shall hear ( more readily than , I trow , he will scape his lord <<target>> the end , for he still lives ) , yet it was an ill day that we met -- an ill day for me and for France .::::in
Howbeit we jogged on , he merrily enough singing a sculdudery song , I something surly , under <<target>> grey February sky , with a keen wind searching out the threadbare places in our raiment .::::a
He had been in one and another of these armed companies that took service with either side , for hire , being better warriors and more skilled than the <<target>> , but a curse to France : for , in peace or war , friend or foe , they plundered all , and held all to ransom .::::noblesse
With Rodrigo de Villandradas , that blood-hound of Spain , he had been high in favour , but when Rodrigo went <<target>> harry south and east , he had tarried at Ruffec , with another thief of that nation , Alfonse Rodigo .::::to
All his talk , as we went , was of slaying men in fight ; whom he <<target>> he cared not much , but chiefly he hated the English and them of Burgundy .::::slew
`` John the Lorrainer , and I , there are no others to <<target>> named with us at the culverin , '' he would brag .::::be
`` We two against an army , give us <<target>> cover , and powder and leaden balls enough .::::good
Master John and I must shoot a match yet , against <<target>> targets , and of them there are plenty under Orleans .::::english
But if I make not the better speed , the town will have fallen , or <<target>> , rescue or no rescue , and of rescue there is no hope at all .::::yielded
The devil fights for the English , who will soon be swarming over the Loire , and that King of Bourges of <<target>> will have to flee , and gnaw horse 's fodder , oats and barley , with your friends in Scotland . ''::::ours

Then he fell to cursing his King , a thing terrible <<target>> hear , and so to asking me questions about myself .::::to
I told him that I had fled my own country <<target>> a man-slaying , hoping , may Heaven forgive me !::::for
to make him think the higher <<target>> me for the deed .::::of
`` So we all begin , '' said he ; `` a shrewd blow , or a fair wench ; a <<target>> , or a birth unlawful , 't is all one forth we are driven to the world and the wars .::::death
Yet you have started well , -- well enough , and <<target>> than I gave your girl 's face credit for .::::better

He gave me so much credit as this for a deed that deserved none , but rather called for rebuke <<target>> him , who , however unworthy , was in religion , and wore the garb of the Blessed Francis .::::from
But very far from fortifying me in virtuous courses , as was his bounden duty , there was no wickedness that he did not <<target>> to teach me , till partly I hated him , and partly , I fear , I admired one so skilled in evil .::::try
The truth is , as I said , that this <<target>> , for that time , was my master .::::man
He was learned in all the arts by which poor and <<target>> folk can keep their bellies full wandering by the way .::::wandering
With women , ugly and terrible of aspect as he was , he had a great power : a pious saying for the old ; a way with the young which has <<target>> been a mystery to me , unless , as some of the learned think , all women are naturally lovers of wickedness , if strength and courage go with it .::::ever
What by wheedling , what by bullying , what by tales of pilgrimages to holy shrines ( he was coming <<target>> Jerusalem by way of Rome , so he told all we met ) , he ever won a welcome .::::from
The Lenten supper which they gave us , with no little kindness , was ended , and we were sitting <<target>> the firelight , Brother Thomas discoursing largely of his pilgrimages , and of his favour among the high clergy .::::in
Thus , at I know not what convent of the Clarisses , { 5 } in Italy , the holy <<target>> had pressed on him a relic of Monsieur St. Aignan , the patron of the good town of Orleans .::::sisters
To see this relic , the farmer , his wife , and his sons and daughters crowded eagerly ; it <<target>> but a little blackened finger bone , yet they were fain to touch it , as is the custom .::::was
But this he would <<target>> yet allow .::::not
`` Perchance some of you , '' he said , `` are already corrupt , not knowing it , with the poisonous breath of that damnable Hussite heresy , <<target>> is blowing from the east like wind of the pestilence , and ye may have doubts concerning the verity of this most holy and miraculous relic ? ''::::which
They all crossed themselves , protesting that no such wicked whisper of Sathanas had ever come <<target>> their minds , nor had they so much as heard of Huss and his blasphemies .::::into
`` Nay , '' said Brother Thomas , `` I could <<target>> blame you if it were partly as I said .::::scarcely
For in this latter time of the world , when I have myself met Jews flocking to Babylon expecting the <<target>> of Antichrist , there be many false brethren , who carry about feigned relics , to deceive the simple .::::birth
Give me , of your grace , <<target>> kerchief , or a napkin . ''::::a
The goodwife gave him a clean white napkin from her aumbry , and he <<target>> it up before their eyes , she not daring to stay his hand .::::tore
`` Now note this holy relic and its wonderful power , '' he said , holding the <<target>> bone high in his left hand , and all our eyes were fixed on it .::::blackened
`` Now mark , '' he said again , <<target>> it over the napkin ; and lo !::::passing
We were still gaping , and crossing ourselves with blessings on this happy day and our unworthy eyes that beheld a miracle , <<target>> he did a thing yet more marvellous , if that might be , which I scarce expect any man will believe .::::when
Then , crossing the room into the corner , that was dusky enough , he faced <<target>> , again holding the blessed relic , whereon we stared , in holy fear .::::us
Then he rose , and in his hand was the <<target>> 's glass vessel , without crack or flaw !::::goodwife
`` Such , '' he said , `` are the properties of this miraculous relic ; there is nothing broken but it will mend , ay , a broken limb , as I can prove on my own sinful <<target>> , '' -- thrusting out his great brown leg , whereon , assuredly , were signs of a fracture ; `` ay , a broken leg , or , my dear daughters , a broken heart . ''::::body
At this , of course , they were all eager to touch the blessed relic with <<target>> poor rings of base metal , such as they wear who are not rich .::::their
Nay , but first , he said , they must give their mites for a convent of the Clarisses , that was building <<target>> Castres , by the care of the holy Colette , whom he might call his patroness , unworthy as he was .::::at
Then he showed us a safe-conduct , signed with that blessed woman 's own hand , <<target>> as she was wont to give to the religious of the Order of St. Francis .::::such
By virtue of this , he said ( and , by miracle , for once he said truly , as I had but too <<target>> cause to learn ) , he could go freely in and out among the camps of French , English , and Burgundians .::::good
You may conceive how joyous they were in that poor cottage , on a night so blessed , and how Brother Thomas told <<target>> of the holy Colette , that famous nun and Mother in Christ , as he that had often been in her company .::::us
He had seen her body lifted in the air while she remained in a pious <<target>> , her mind soaring aloft and her fleshly body following it some way .::::ecstasy
He had often watched that snow-white beast which followed her , such a creature as is <<target>> in no country of the sinful world , but is a thing of Paradise .::::known
And he had tried to caress this wondrous creature of God , but <<target>> , for none but the holy sister Colette may handle it .::::vainly
Concerning her miracles of healing , too , he told us , all of which <<target>> already knew for very truth , and still know on better warranty than his .::::we
Ye may believe that , late and at last , Brother Thomas had his choice of the warmest place to sleep in -- by the `` four , '' as is <<target>> wont of pilgrims , for in his humility this holy man would not suffer the farmer 's wife and the farmer to give him their bed , as they desired .::::the
But I have since held that he feigned all by art magic and very sorcery , for , as we wended next morning on our road , he plainly <<target>> me , truly or falsely , that he had picked up the blackened finger-bone out of the loathly ashes of the dead in the burned castle near Ruffec .::::told
Wherefore I consider that when Brother Thomas sold the grace of his relic , by the touching of rings , he <<target>> in a devilish black simony , vending to simple Christians no grace but that of his master , Sathanas .::::dealt
Thus he was not only evil ( if I guess aright , which I submit to the judgment of my ecclesiastical superiors , and of the Church ) , <<target>> he had even found out a new kind of wickedness , such as I never read of in any books of theology wherein is much to be learned .::::but
With this craft he would affray the peasants about the fire in the little inns where we sometimes rested , when he would be <<target>> tales of bogles and eldritch fantasies , and of fiends that rout and rap , and make the tables and firkins dance .::::telling
Such art of speech , I am advised , is spoken of by St. Jerome , in his comment on the holy prophet the saint Isaiah , and they <<target>> use it he calls `` ventriloqui , '' in the Latin , or `` belly-speakers , '' and he takes an unfavourable sense of them and their doings .::::that
So much I have from the learned William de Boyis , Prior of Pluscarden , where now I write ; with whom I have conversed of <<target>> matters privately , and he thinks this art a thing that men may learn by practice , without dealing in nigromancy and the black magic .::::these
This question I am content to leave , as <<target>> fitting , to the judgment of my superiors .::::is
And indeed , as at that time , Brother Thomas spake not in his belly except <<target>> make sport and affray the simple people , soon turning their fears to mirth .::::to
Certainly the country folk never misdoubted him , the women for a holy man , the men for a good fellow ; though all <<target>> of his own cloth shrank from him , and I have seen them cross themselves in his presence , but to no avail .::::they
He would say a word or two in their ears , <<target>> they straightway left the place where he might be .::::and
None the less , with his tales and arts , Brother Thomas commonly so wrought that we seldom slept `` a la belle etoile '' <<target>> that bitter spring weather , but we ordinarily had leave to lie by the hearth , and got a supper and a breakfast .::::in
The good peasants would find their hen- roosts the poorer often , for <<target>> that he could snap up was to him fortune of war .::::all
I loved these manners little , <<target>> leave him I could not .::::but
His eye was ever on me ; if I stirred in the night he was awake and <<target>> me , and by day he never let me out of a bolt 's flight .::::watching
To cut the string of his wicked weapon was a thought <<target>> in my mind , but he was too vigilant .::::often
My face was his passport , he said ; my face , indeed , being innocent enough , <<target>> was no shame to me , but an endless cause of mirth and mockery to him .::::as
Yet , by reason of the serviceableness of the man in that perilous country , and my constant surprise and wonder at what he did and said , and might do next ( which no man could guess beforehand ) , and a kind <<target>> foolish pride in his very wickedness , so much beyond what I had ever dreamed of , and for pure fear of him also , I found myself following with him day by day , ever thinking to escape , and never escaping .::::of
I have since deemed that , just as his wickedness was to a boy ( for I was little more ) , a kind of charm , <<target>> up of a sort of admiring hate and fear , so my guilelessness ( as it seemed to him ) also wrought on him strangely .::::made
For in part it made sport for him to see my open mouth and staring eyes at the spectacle of his devilries , and in <<target>> he really hated me , and hated my very virtue of simplicity , which it was his desire and delight to surprise and corrupt .::::part
For , walking into a village , we saw men , women , and children , all gathered , gaping about <<target>> that stood beside a horse nearly foundered , its legs thrust wide , its nostrils all foam and blood .::::one
The man , who seemed as weary as his horse , held a paper in his <<target>> , which the priest of that parish took from him and read aloud to us .::::hands
The rider was a royal messenger , one Thomas Scott of Easter Buccleuch , <<target>> Rankel Burn , whom I knew later , and his tidings were evil .::::in
The Dauphin bade his good towns know that , on the 12th of February , Sir John Stewart , constable of the <<target>> forces in France , had fallen in battle at Rouvray , with very many of his company , and some Frenchmen .::::scottish
They had beset a convoy under Sir John Fastolf , <<target>> was bringing meat to the English leaguered about Orleans .::::that
But Fastolf had wholly routed them ( by treachery , as we later learned of the Comte <<target>> Clermont ) , and Sir John Stewart , with his brother Sir William , were slain .::::de
Wherefore the Dauphin bade the good towns send him <<target>> and men , or all was lost .::::money
Such were the evil tidings , which put me in sore fear for my brother Robin , <<target>> that , in such an onfall , would go far , as beseemed his blood .::::one
But as touching his fortunes , Thomas Scott could tell me neither good nor bad , <<target>> he knew Robin , and gave him a good name for a stout man-at- arms .::::though
It was of some comfort to me to hear a Scots tongue ; but , for the rest , I travelled <<target>> with a heavier heart , deeming that Orleans must indeed fall ere I could seek my brother in that town .::::on
My old nurse , when I was a child , used to tell me a long story <<target>> a prince who , wandering through the world , made friends with many strange companions .::::of
One she called Lynx-eye , that could see through a mountain ; one was Swift-foot , that could outrun the wind ; <<target>> was Fine-ear , that could hear the grass growing ; and there was Greedy-gut , that could swallow a river .::::one
These wanderers were as strange as the friends of the prince , <<target>> were as variously , but scarce as honourably , gifted .::::and
There was the one-armed soldier , who showed his stump very piteously when it was a question of begging from <<target>> burgess , but was as well furnished with limbs as other men when no burgess was in sight .::::a
There was a wretched woman violer , with her jackanapes , and with her husband , a hang-dog ruffian , she bearing <<target>> mark of his fist on her eye , and commonly trailing far behind him with her brat on her back .::::the
There was a blind man , with his staff , who might well enough <<target>> to Keen-eye , that is , when no strangers were in sight .::::answer
There was a layman , wearing cope and stole and selling indulgences , but our captain , <<target>> Thomas , soon banished him from our company , for that he divided the trade .::::brother
Others there were , each one of them a Greedy-gut , a crew of broken men , who marched <<target>> us on the roads ; but we never entered a town or a house with these discreditable attendants .::::with
Now , it may seem strange , but the nearer we drew to Chinon and the Court , the poorer <<target>> the country , for the Court and the men-at-arms had stripped it bare , like a flight of locusts .::::grew
For this reason the Dauphin could seldom abide long at one place , for he was so much better known than trusted that the very cordwainer would not let him march off in a <<target>> pair of boots without seeing his money , and , as the song said , he even greased his old clouted shoon , and made them last as long as he might .::::new
For head-gear he was as ill provided , seeing <<target>> he had pawned the fleurons of his crown .::::that
There were days when his treasurer at Tours ( as I myself have heard him say ) did not <<target>> three ducats in his coffers , and the heir of France borrowed money from his very cook .::::reckon
So the people told us , and I have often marvelled how , despite this poverty , kings and <<target>> , when I have seen them , go always in cloth of gold , with rich jewels .::::nobles
But , as you may guess , near the Court of <<target>> beggar Dauphin the country-folk too were sour and beggarly .::::a
We had to tighten our belts before we came to the wood wherein cross-roads meet , <<target>> north , south , and east , within five miles of the town of Chinon .::::from
There was not a white coin among us ; night was falling , and it seemed as if we must <<target>> out under the stars , and be fed , like the wolves we heard howling , on wind .::::lie
By the roadside , at the crossways , but not in view of the <<target>> , a council of our ragged regiment was held in a deep ditch .::::road
It would be late ere we reached the town , gates would scarce open for us , we could not fee the warders , houses would <<target>> shut and dark ; the King 's archers were apt to bear them unfriendly to wandering men with the devil dancing in their pouches .::::be
As for Brother Thomas , an evil bruit had gone before us concerning a cordelier that the fowls and <<target>> were fain to follow , as wilder things , they say , follow the blessed St. Francis .::::geese
So there sat Brother Thomas at the cross-roads , footsore , hungry , and sullen , in the <<target>> of us , who dared not speak , he twanging at the string of his arbalest .::::midst
He called himself our Moses , in his blasphemous way , and the blind man having girded at him for not leading <<target>> into the land of plenty , he had struck the man till he bled , and now stood stanching his wound .::::us
Suddenly Brother Thomas ceased from his twanging , and holding up <<target>> hand for silence , leaned his ear to the ground .::::his
The night was still , though a cold <<target>> came very stealthily from the east .::::wind
`` It is but the noise of the brook by <<target>> way , '' said the blind man , sullenly .::::the
`` No , it is <<target>> , '' he whispered .::::horses
`` My men , they that ride horses can spare <<target>> out of their abundance to feed the poor . ''::::somewhat
And with that he began <<target>> up his arbalest hastily .::::winding
`` Aymeric , '' he said to one of our afflicted company , `` you draw a good bow for a <<target>> man ; hide yourself in the opposite ditch , and be ready when I give the word 'Pax vobiscum . '::::blind
From the sound there are not more <<target>> five or six of them .::::than
We can but fail , at worst , and the <<target>> is thick behind us , where none may pursue .::::wood
You , Norman de Pitcullo , have your whinger ready , and fasten this rope tightly to yonder birch-tree stem , <<target>> then cross and give it a turn or two about that oak sapling on the other side of the way .::::and
That trap will bring down <<target>> horse or twain .::::a
Be quick , you <<target>> wine-bag ! ''::::scotch
But a Leslie of Pitcullo does <<target>> take purses on the high-road .::::not
Therefore my heart rose in sudden anger , I having all day hated him more and more <<target>> his bitter tongue , and I was opening my mouth to cry `` A secours ! ''::::for
-- a warning to them who were approaching , when , quick as lightning , Brother Thomas <<target>> me behind the knee-joints , and I was on the ground with his weight above me .::::caught
One cry I had uttered , when <<target>> hand was on my mouth .::::his
`` Give him the steel <<target>> his guts ! ''::::in
`` Slit his weasand , <<target>> Scotch pig ! ''::::the
They were all <<target>> me now .::::on
`` No , I keep him for <<target>> sport , '' snarled Brother Thomas .::::better
`` He shall learn the Scots for 'ecorcheurs ' ( flayers <<target>> men ) `` when we have filled our pouches . ''::::of
With that he crammed a great napkin in my mouth , so that I could not cry , made it fast with a piece of cord , trussed me with the rope which he <<target>> bidden me tie across the path to trip the horses , and with a kick sent me flying to the bottom of the ditch , my face being turned from the road .::::had
I could hear Giles and Aymeric steal across the way , and <<target>> rustling of boughs as they settled on the opposite side .::::the
I could hear the trampling hoofs of horses <<target>> slowly and wearily from the east .::::coming
At this moment chanced a thing that has ever seemed strange to me : I <<target>> the hand of the violer woman laid lightly and kindly on my hair .::::felt
I had ever pitied her , and , as I might , had been kind to <<target>> and her bairn ; and now , as it appears , she pitied me .::::her
But there could be no help in her , nor did <<target>> dare to raise her voice and give an alarm .::::she
So I could but gnaw at my gag , trying to find scope for my tongue to cry , for now it was not only <<target>> travellers that I would save , but my own life , and my escape from a death of torment lay on my success .::::the
But my mouth was as dry as a kiln , my tongue <<target>> doubled back till I thought that I should have choked .::::was
The night was now deadly still , and the <<target>> of the weary hoofs drew nearer and nearer .::::ring
Closer and closer the travellers drew , and soon it was plain that they rode not carelessly , nor as men who deemed themselves secure , for the tramp of one horse <<target>> itself out in front of the others , and this , doubtless , was ridden by an `` eclaireur , '' sent forward to see that the way ahead was safe .::::singled
Now I heard a low growl of a curse from <<target>> Thomas , and my heart took some comfort .::::brother
They might be warned , if the Brother shot at the foremost man ; or , at worst , if he was permitted to pass , the man would bear <<target>> tidings to Chinon , and we might be avenged , the travellers and I , for I now felt that they and I were in the same peril .::::swift
The single rider drew near , and passed , and there <<target>> no cry of `` Pax vobiscum '' from the friar .::::came
But the foremost rider had , perchance , the best horse , and the least wearied , <<target>> there was even too great a gap between him and the rest of his company .::::for
And now their voices might be heard , as they talked by the way , yet not <<target>> loud that , straining my ears as I did , I could hear any words .::::so
But the sounds waxed louder , with words spoken , ring of hoofs , and rattle of scabbard on <<target>> , and so I knew , at least , that they who rode so late were men armed .::::stirrup
Nearer , nearer they came , then almost opposite , and now , as I listened to hear the traitorous signal of murder -- '' Pax vobiscum '' -- and the twang of bow-strings , on the night there rang <<target>> voice , a woman 's voice , soft but wondrous clear , such as never I knew from any lips but hers who then spoke ; that voice I heard in its last word , `` Jesus ! ''::::a
and still it is <<target>> in my ears .::::sounding
`` Nous voila presqu'arrives , grace <<target>> mes Freres de Paradis . ''::::a
Instantly , I knew not how , at the sound of that blessed voice , and the courage in it , I felt <<target>> fear slip from me , as when we awaken from a dreadful dream , and in its place came happiness and peace .::::my
Scarce otherwise might he feel who dies <<target>> fear and wakes in Paradise .::::in
On the forest boughs above me , my face being turned from the road , somewhat passed , or seemed to pass , like a soft golden <<target>> , such as in the Scots tongue we call a `` boyn , '' that ofttimes , men say , travels with the blessed saints .::::light
Yet some may deem it but a glancing in my own eyes , from the blood flying to my head ; howsoever it be , I had never <<target>> the like before , nor have I seen it since , and , assuredly , the black branches and wild weeds were lit up bare and clear .::::seen
The tramp of the horses passed , there was no cry of `` Pax vobiscum , '' no <<target>> of bows , and slowly the ring of hoofs died away on the road to Chinon .::::twang
Her man struck her across the <<target>> , and she was still .::::mouth
he whispered to <<target>> Thomas .::::brother
`` Fool , had I not seen , <<target>> I not have given the word ?::::would
Get you gone , all the sort of you , there is <<target>> fey man in this company , be he who he will .::::a
ye shall have my <<target>> of it .::::news
What sight saw'st <<target>> ? ''::::thou
Fools , what should I have seen , but an outrider , and he a King 's messenger , sent forward to warn the rest by <<target>> fall , if he fell , or to raise the country on us , if he passed , and if afterward they passed us not .::::his
They were men wary in war , <<target>> travelling on the Dauphin 's business .::::and
Verily there was no <<target>> in them . ''::::profit
`` And that <<target>> all ?::::was
We saw other <<target>> . ''::::things
`` What I saw was enough for me , or for any good clerk <<target>> St. Nicholas , and of questions there has been more than enough .::::of
scatter to the winds , <<target>> be silent . ''::::and
`` And may we not put the steel <<target>> that Scotch dog who delayed us ?::::in
Saints or sorcerers , their horses must <<target>> come down but for him . ''::::have
Brother Thomas caught me up , as if I had been a child , in his arms , and <<target>> me over the ditch-bank into the wood , where I crashed on my face through the boughs .::::tossed
`` Only one horse would have fallen , <<target>> that had brought the others on us .::::and
The Scot is safe enough , <<target>> mouth is well shut .::::his
And now , begone with you : to Fierbois , if <<target>> will ; I go my own road -- alone . ''::::you
They wandered each his own way , <<target>> and murmuring , starved and weary .::::sullen
What they had seen or fancied , and whether , if the rest saw aught strange , <<target>> Thomas saw nought , I knew not then , and know not till this hour .::::brother
But the tale of this ambush , and of how they that lay in hiding held their hands , and fled -- having come , none <<target>> say whence , and gone , whither none might tell -- is true , and was soon widely spoken of in the realm of France .::::might
The woods fell still again , save for the babble of the brook , and there <<target>> lay , bound , and heard only the stream in the silence of the night .::::i
At first my mind was benumbed , like my body ; but the pain of my face , smarting <<target>> switch and scratch of the boughs through which I had fallen , awoke me to thought and fear .::::with
I turned over to lie on my back , and look up for any light of hope in the sky , <<target>> nothing fell on me from heaven save a cold rain , that the leafless boughs did little to ward off .::::but
Scant hope or comfort had I ; my whole body ached and shuddered , only I did not thirst , for the rain soaked through the accursed napkin <<target>> my mouth , while the dank earth , with its graveyard smell , seemed to draw me down into itself , as it drags a rotting leaf .::::on
I was buried before death , as it were , even if the wolves found me not and gave me other sepulture ; and now and again I heard their <<target>> hunting cry , and at every patter of a beast 's foot , or shivering of the branches , I thought my hour was come -- and I unconfessed !::::long
This night to me was like the night <<target>> a man laid living in the tomb .::::of
By no twisting and turning could I loosen the rope that Brother Thomas <<target>> bound me in , with a hand well taught by cruel practice .::::had
Whether I slept by whiles , or waked all night , I know not , but certainly I dreamed , seeing with shut eyes faces that came and went , shifting <<target>> beauty such as I had never yet beheld , to visages more and more hideous and sinful , ending at last in the worst -- the fell countenance of Noiroufle .::::from
Then I woke wholly to myself , in terror , to find that he was not there , and now came to me some of <<target>> ease which had been born of the strange , sweet voice , and the strange words , `` Mes Freres de Paradis . ''::::that
`` My brethren of Paradise '' ; who could she be that rode so <<target>> in company of armed men , and yet spoke of such great kinsfolk ?::::late
That it might be the holy Colette , then , as now , so famous in France for <<target>> miracles , and good deeds , and her austerities , was a thought that arose in me .::::her
But the holy Sister , as I had heard , never mounted a horse in her many wanderings , she being a villein 's daughter , but was carried <<target>> a litter , or fared in a chariot ; nor did she go in company with armed men , for who would dare to lay hands on her ?::::in
So my questioning <<target>> no answer .::::found
And now I heard light feet , as of some beast stirring and <<target>> in the trees overhead , and there with a light jingling noise .::::scratching
Whatever it was , it raced about the tree , coming nearer and going further away , till it fell with a weight on my breast , <<target>> , shivering with cold , all strained like a harp-string as I was , I could have screamed , but for the gag in my mouth .::::and
There the red eyes looked on me , and I on them , till I <<target>> giddy with gazing , and half turned my head with a stifled sob .::::grew
Then there came a sharp cry which I knew well enough , and the beast leaped up and nestled under my breast , for this so dreadful thing was no worse than the <<target>> woman 's jackanapes , that had slipped its chain , or , rather , had drawn it out of her hand , for now I plainly heard the light chain jingle .::::violer
The poor beast a little helped to warm me with the heat of his body , <<target>> he was a friendly creature , making me feel less alone in the night .::::and
Yet , in my own misery , I could not help but sorrow for the poor woman when she found her jackanapes gone , that was <<target>> part of her living : and I knew what she would have to bear for its loss from the man that was her master .::::great
As this was in my mind , the first grey stole into the sky so that I could see the black branches <<target>> ; and now there awoke the cries of birds , and soon the wood was full of their sweet jargoning .::::overhead
This put some hope into my heart ; but the morning hours were long , <<target>> colder than the night , to one wet to the bone with the rains .::::and
Now , too , I comforted myself with believing that , arrive what might , I was wholly quit of Brother Thomas , whereat I rejoiced , like the <<target>> in the tale who had sold his soul to the Enemy , and yet , in the end , escaped his clutches by the aid of Holy Church .::::man
Death was better to me than life with Brother Thomas , who must <<target>> have dragged me with him to the death that can not die .::::assuredly
Morning must bring travellers , and my <<target>> might lead them to my aid .::::groaning
And , indeed , foot-farers did come , and I did groan as well as I could , but , like the Levite in Scripture , they passed by on the other side of the <<target>> , fearing to meddle with one wounded perchance to the death , lest they might be charged with his slaying , if he died , or might anger his enemies , if he lived .::::way
The light was now fully come , and some rays of the blessed sun fell upon <<target>> , whereon I said orisons within myself , commanding my case to the saints .::::me
Devoutly I prayed , that , if I escaped with life , I might <<target>> delivered from the fear of man , and namely of Brother Thomas .::::be
It were better for me to have died by his weapon at first , beside the broken bridge , than <<target>> have lived his slave , going in dread of him , with a slave 's hatred in my heart .::::to
So now I prayed for spirit enough to defend my honour and that of my <<target>> , which I had borne to hear reviled without striking a blow for it .::::country
Never again might I dree <<target>> extreme shame and dishonour .::::this
Then , as if he and the other saints had listened to me , I heard sounds <<target>> horses ' hoofs , coming up the road from Chinon way , and also voices .::::of
These , like the others of the night before , came <<target>> , and I heard a woman 's voice gaily singing .::::nearer
And then awoke such joy in my heart as never was there before , and this was far the gladdest voice that ever yet <<target>> heard , for , behold , it was the speech of my own country , and the tune I knew and the words .::::i
`` O , we maun part this love , Willie , That has been lang between ; There 's a French lord coming over sea <<target>> wed me wi ' a ring ; There 's a French lord coming o'er the sea To wed and take me hame ! ''::::to
`` And who shall the French <<target>> be , Elliot ? ''::::lord
came another voice , a man 's this time , `` though he <<target>> not cross the sea for you , the worse the luck .::::need
Is it young <<target>> de Xaintrailles ?::::pothon
Faith , he comes often enough to see how his new penoncel <<target>> in my hands , and seems right curious in painting . ''::::fares
It may be deemed strange that , even in this hour , I conceived in my <<target>> a great mislike of this young French lord , how unjustly I soon well understood .::::heart
`` O , nae French lord for me , father , O , nae French lord for me , But <<target>> 'll ware my heart on a true-born Scot , And wi ' him I 'll cross the sea . ''::::i
`` Oh , father , lo you , I can make as well as sing , for <<target>> is no word of the old ballant , but just came on to my tongue ! ''::::that
They were now right close to me , and , half in fear , half in hope , I <<target>> to stir and rustle in the grass , for of my stifled groaning had hitherto come no profit .::::began
Then I heard <<target>> horses stop .::::the
`` What stirring is that <<target>> the wood , father ?::::in
I am afraid , '' <<target>> the girl 's voice .::::came
`` Belike a fox <<target>> his lair .::::shifting
Push on , <<target>> Elliot . ''::::maid
The horses advanced , when , by the blessing of <<target>> saints , the jackanapes woke in my breast .::::the
The creature was used to run questing with a little wooden bowl <<target>> carried for largesse , to beg of horsemen for his mistress .::::he
He leaped the ditch , and I suppose he ran in front of <<target>> steeds , shaking his little bowl , as was his wont .::::the
Some travelling body <<target>> lost him .::::has
Let me jump down <<target>> catch him .::::and
Look , he has a little coat on , made like <<target>> herald 's tabard , and wears the colours of France .::::a
Here , hold <<target>> reins . ''::::my
Who can tell where , or <<target>> , his owner is ?::::who
Take you my reins , and I <<target>> bring you the beast . ''::::will
I heard him <<target>> dismount .::::heavily
`` It will not let itself be caught by a lame man , '' he said ; and he scrambled up <<target>> ditch bank , while the jackanapes fled to me , and then ran forward again , back and forth .::::the
`` Nom Dieu , whom <<target>> we here ? ''::::have
I turned , and made such a sound with my mouth <<target>> I might , while the jackanapes nestled to my breast .::::as
`` Why do ye not <<target>> , man ? ''::::speak
he said again ; and I turned my eyes on him , <<target>> as pitifully as might be out of my blood-bedabbled face .::::looking
He was a burly man , great of growth , with fresh red cheeks , blue eyes , reddish hair , and a <<target>> beard , such as are many in the Border marches of my own country , the saints bless them for true men !::::red
Withal he dragged his leg in walking , <<target>> he did with difficulty and much carefulness .::::which
He `` hirpled , '' as we say , towards me very warily ; then , seeing the rope bound about <<target>> , and the cloth in my mouth , he drew his dagger , but not to cut my bonds .::::me
He was over canny for that , but he slit the string that kept the cursed gag in my mouth , and picked it out with <<target>> dagger point ; and , oh the blessed taste of that first long draught of air , I can not set it down in words !::::his
he asked in French , but <<target>> a rude Border accent .::::with
`` I am a kindly Scot , '' I said <<target>> our own tongue , `` of your own country .::::in
And then a dwawm , as we call <<target>> , or fainting-fit , came over me .::::it
When I knew myself again , I was lying with my head in a maiden 's lap , and well I could have believed that the fairies had carried <<target>> to their own land , as has befallen many , whereof some have returned to earth with the tale , and some go yet in that unearthly company .::::me
`` Gentle demoiselle , are you <<target>> gracious Queen of Faerie ? ''::::the
Indeed this lady was clad all in the fairy green , and her eyes were as blue as the <<target>> above her head , and the long yellow locks on her shoulders were shining like the sun .::::sky
`` Faith , he might have made a <<target>> guess , '' cried the man .::::worse
With that he brought some water from the burn by the road , <<target>> therewith he wiped my face , first giving me to drink .::::and
When I had drunk , the maid whom he called Elliot got up , her face very rosy , and they set my back against <<target>> tree , which I was right sorry for , as indeed I was now clean out of fairyland and back in this troublesome world .::::a
The horses stood by us , tethered to <<target>> , and browsed on the budding branches .::::trees
I told him , shortly , that I was a Scot of <<target>> ; whereto he answered that my speech was strangely English .::::fife
I gave my name but not that of our lands , and showed him how I had been wandering north , to take service with the Dauphin , when I was set <<target>> , and robbed and bound by thieves , for I had no clearness as to telling him all my tale , and no desire to claim acquaintance with Brother Thomas .::::upon
`` And the <<target>> ? ''::::jackanapes
he asked , whereto I had no better answer than that I had seen the beast with a wandering violer on the <<target>> before , and that she having lost it , as I supposed , it had come to me in the night .::::day
The girl was standing with the creature in her arms , feeding <<target>> with pieces of comfits from a pouch fastened at her girdle .::::it
`` The little beast is not mine to give , '' I went on , seeing how she had an affection to the ape , `` but till the owner claims <<target>> , it is all the ransom I have to pay for my life , and I would fain see it wear the colours of this gentle maid who saved me .::::it
It has many pretty tricks , but though to- day I be a beggar , <<target>> trow she will not let it practise that ill trick of begging . ''::::i
`` Sooner would I beg myself , fair sir , '' she said , with such a courtly reverence as surprised me ; for though they seemed folks <<target>> to see in the world , they were not , methought , of noble blood , nor had they with them any company of palfreniers or archers .::::well
`` Elliot , you feed the jackanapes and let our countryman hunger , '' said the man ; and , <<target>> again , she made haste to give me some of the provision she had made for her journey .::::blushing
So I ate and drank , she waiting on me very gently ; but now , being weary of painful writing , and hearing the call to the <<target>> , and the brethren trampling thither , I must break off , for , if I be late , they will sconce me of my ale .::::refectory
it is to these little cares of creature comforts that I am come , who have seen the <<target>> of so many a war , and lived and fought on rat 's flesh at Compiegne .::::face
Not seemly , was it , that I should expect these kind people , even though they <<target>> of my own country , to do more for me than they had already done .::::were
So , when I had eaten and drunk , I made my obeisance as if <<target>> would be trudging towards Chinon , adding many thanks , as well I might .::::i
`` You must know , '' said he , `` that though I am the father <<target>> your Fairy Queen , I am also one of the gracious Princess 's obedient subjects .::::of
No mother has she , poor wench , '' he added , in a lower voice ; `` and faith , we men <<target>> always obey some woman -- as it seems now that the King himself must soon do and all his captains . ''::::must
`` You speak , '' I said , `` <<target>> the gracious Queen of Sicily and Jerusalem ? ''::::of
-- a lady who was thought to be of much avail , as was but right , <<target>> the counsels of her son-in-law , the Dauphin , he having married her gentle daughter .::::in
`` Ay ; Queen Yolande is far ben { 7 } <<target>> the King -- would he had no worse counsellors ! ''::::with
said he , smiling ; `` but I speak of a far more <<target>> sovereign , if all that she tells of herself be true .::::potent
You have heard , or belike you have not heard , of the famed Pucelle -- so she calls herself , I hope not without a <<target>> -- the Lorrainer peasant lass , who is to drive the English into the sea , so she gives us all fair warning ? ''::::warranty
`` Never a word have I heard , or never marked so senseless a bruit if I <<target>> it ; she must be some moon-struck wench , and in her wits wandering . ''::::heard
cried the girl whom he called Elliot , her face rose-red with anger ; and from her eyes two blue rays of <<target>> shot straight to mine , so that I believe my face waxed wan , the blood flying to my heart .::::light
`` Elliot , if your renowned maid can fright the English as you have <<target>> a good Scot , the battle is won and Orleans is delivered . ''::::affrayed
But she had turned her back on us pettishly , <<target>> was talking in a low voice to her jackanapes .::::and
As for me , if my face had been pale before , it now grew red enough for shame <<target>> I had angered her , who was so fair , though how I had sinned I knew not .::::that
But often I have seen that women , and these the best , will be all afire at a light <<target>> , wherein the touchiest man-at-arms who ever fought on the turn of a straw could pick no honourable quarrel .::::word
`` How have I been so <<target>> as to offend mademoiselle ? ''::::unhappy
`` Oh , she will hear no bourde nor jest on this Pucelle that all the countryside <<target>> clashing of , and that is bewitching my maid , methinks , even from afar .::::is
My maid Elliot ( so I call her from my mother 's kin , but her true name is Marion , and the French dub her Heliote ) hath set all her heart and her hope <<target>> one that is a young lass like herself , and she is full of old soothsayings about a virgin that is to come out of an oak- wood and deliver France -- no less !::::on
For me , I misdoubt that Merlin , the Welsh prophet on whom they set store , and the rest of the soothsayers , are all <<target>> one tale with old Thomas Rhymer , of Ercildoune , whose prophecies our own folk crack about by the ingle on winter nights at home .::::in
But be it as it may , this wench of Lorraine has , these three-quarters of a year , been about the Sieur Robert <<target>> Baudricourt , now commanding for the King at Vaucouleurs , away in the east , praying him to send her to the Court .::::de
She has visions , and hears voices -- so she says ; and <<target>> gives Baudricourt no peace till he carries her to the King .::::she
The story goes that , on the ill day of the Battle of the Herrings , she , being at Vaucouleurs -- a hundred leagues away and more , -- <<target>> that fight plainly , and our countrymen fallen , manlike , around the Constable , and the French flying like hares before a little pack of English talbots .::::saw
The second-sight she may have -- it is common enough , if you believe the red-shanked Highlanders ; but <<target>> maiden she set forth from Vaucouleurs , great miracle it is if maiden she comes to Chinon . ''::::if
He whispered this in a manner that we call `` <<target>> , '' being a free man with his tongue .::::pauky
Now , nothing would serve my wilful daughter Elliot ( she being possessed , as I said , with love for this female mystery ) , but that we must ride forth and be the first to meet the Maid on <<target>> way , and offer her shelter at my poor house , if she does but seem honest , though methinks a hostelry is good enough for one that has ridden so far , with men for all her company .::::her
And I , being but a subject of my daughter 's , as I said , and this a Saint 's Day , when a man may <<target>> from his paints and brushes , I even let saddle the steeds , and came forth to see what ferlies Heaven would send us . ''::::rest
`` Oh , a lucky day for me , fair sir , '' I answered him , marvelling to <<target>> him speak of paint and brushes , and even as I spoke a thought came into my mind .::::hear
`` If you will listen to me , sir , '' I said , `` and if the gentle maid , your daughter , will pardon me for staying you so long from the <<target>> , I will tell you that , to my thinking , you have come over late , for that yesterday the Maiden you speak of rode , after nightfall , into Chinon . ''::::road
Now the girl turned round on me , and , in faith , <<target>> asked no more than to see her face , kind or angry .::::i
`` You tell us , sir , that you never heard speak of the Maid till <<target>> hour , and now you say that you know of her comings and goings .::::this
Unriddle your riddle , sir , if it pleases you , and say <<target>> you saw and knew one that you never heard speech of . ''::::how
She was still very wroth , and I knew not whether I might not anger <<target>> yet more , so I louted lowly , cap in hand , and said --::::her
`` How may that be , if <<target>> robbed and bound you ? ''::::thieves
But , upon my faith as a gentleman , and by the arm-bone of the holy Apostle Andrew , which these sinful eyes have seen , in the church of the Apostle in <<target>> own town , somewhat holy passed this way last night ; and if this Maid be indeed sent from heaven , that holy thing was she , and none other . ''::::his
saints are not common wayfarers <<target>> our roads at night .::::on
There is no 'wale ' of saints in this country , '' said the father of Elliot ; `` and as this Pucelle of <<target>> must needs pass by us here , if she is still on the way , even tell us all your tale . ''::::lorraine
With that I told them how the `` brigands '' ( for so they now began to call such reivers as <<target>> Thomas ) were , to my shame , and maugre my head , for a time of my own company .::::brother
And I told them of the bushment that they laid to trap travellers , and how I had striven to give a warning , and how they bound me and gagged me , and of the strange girl 's voice that spoke through the night of `` mes <<target>> de Paradis , '' and of that golden `` boyn '' faring in the dark , that I thought I saw , and of the words spoken by the blind man and the soldier , concerning some vision which affrayed them , I know not what .::::freres
At this tale the girl Elliot , <<target>> herself very devoutly , cried aloud --::::crossing
`` O father , did <<target>> not tell you so ?::::i
Oh , come , let us mount and ride to Chinon , for already she is within the <<target>> ; had we not ridden forth so early , we must have heard tell of it . ''::::walls
It seemed something hard to me that I was to have no grace to behold what others , and they assuredly much <<target>> sinful men than myself , had been permitted to look upon , if this damsel was right in that she said .::::more
And how could any man , were he himself a saint , see <<target>> was passing by , when his head was turned the other way ?::::what
Howbeit , she called me a gentleman , as indeed I had professed myself to be , and this I saw , <<target>> her passion of anger against me was spent , as then , and gone by , like a shower of April .::::that

A murrain on the English <<target>> that dealt the stroke !::::bill
To make up my ransom ( for I was taken prisoner there , where so few got quarter ) cost me every crown I could gather , so <<target>> even fell back on the skill I learned , like you , when I was a lad , from a priest in the Abbey of Melrose .::::i
Ashamed of my craft I am none , for it is better to paint banners and missals than to beg ; and now , for these five years , <<target>> am advanced to be Court painter to the King himself , thanks to John Kirkmichael , Bishop of Orleans , who is of my far- away kin .::::i
A sore fall it is , for a Hume of Polwarth ; and strangely enough do the French scribes write my name -- 'Hauves <<target>> , ' and otherwise , so please you ; but that is ever their wont with the best names in all broad Scotland .::::poulvoir

`` Till this gentleman marches with the flower of France against our old enemy of England , <<target>> should say , father , and helps to show them another Bannockburn on Loire-side . ''::::you

But , as touching what this gentle demoiselle has said , I may march <<target>> , may I not , when the Maid rides to Orleans ? ''::::also
Then we clapped hands on it , for a bargain , and he did <<target>> insult me by the offer of any arles , or luck penny .::::not
The girl was helped to horse , setting her foot on my hand , that dirled as <<target>> little shoe sole touched it ; and the jackanapes rode on her saddle- bow very proudly .::::her
For me , I ran as well as I might , but stiffly enough , being cold to the marrow , holding <<target>> the father 's stirrup-leather and watching the lass 's yellow hair that danced on her shoulders as she rode foremost .::::by
In this company , then , so much better than that I had left , we <<target>> Chinon town , and came to their booth , and their house on the water-side .::::entered
Then , of their kindness , I must to bed , which comfort I sorely <<target>> , and there I slept , in fragrant linen sheets , till compline rang .::::needed
During supper , to which they called me , my master showed me the best countenance that might be , and <<target>> was great joy to me to eat off clean platters once again , on white linen strewn with spring flowers .::::it
As the time was Lent , we had fare that they called meagre : fish from the Vienne water , below the town , and <<target>> cooked in divers fashions , all to the point of excellence , for the wine and fare of Chinon are famous in France .::::eggs
As my duty was , I waited on my master and on the maid Elliot , who was never silent , but babbled of all that she had heard since she came into the town ; as to where the Pucelle had lighted off her horse ( on <<target>> edge-stone of a well , so it seemed ) , and where and with what goodwife she lodged , and how as yet no message had come to her from the castle and the King ; and great joy it was to watch and to hear her .::::the
Yet to my sisters my father was ever debonnair ; for , as I have often marked , the mothers <<target>> the sons best and the sons the mothers , and between father and daughters it is the same .::::love
But of my mother I have spoken <<target>> the beginning of this history .::::in
When supper was ended , and all things made orderly , I had no <<target>> mind for my bed , having slept my fill for that time .::::great
But the maid Elliot left us early , which was as <<target>> the light had been taken out of the room .::::if
Beside the fire , my master fell to devising about the <<target>> of the country , as burgesses love to do .::::state
`` Not that our Dauphin is a coward , the blood of Saint Louis has not fallen so low , but he is wholly under the Sieur de <<target>> Tremouille , who was thrust on him while he was young , and still is his master , or , as we say , his governor .::::la
Now , this lord is one that would fain run with the hare and hunt with the hounds , and this side <<target>> him is Burgundian and that is Armagnac , and on which of the sides his heart is , none knows .::::of
But he waxes very fat for a man-at-arms , and is <<target>> of women , and wine , and of his ease .::::fond
Now , if once the King ranges up with the Bastard of Orleans , and Xaintrailles , and the other captains , who hate <<target>> Tremouille , then his power , and the power of the Chancellor , the Archbishop of Rheims , is gone and ended .::::la
And the captains <<target>> 'Forward ! '::::cry
and the archbishop and La <<target>> cry 'Back ! '::::tremouille
and in the meantime Orleans will fall , and the Dauphin <<target>> fly whither he will , for France is lost .::::may
But , for myself , I would to the saints that I and my lass were home again , <<target>> the old thorn-tree at Polwarth on the green , where I have been merry lang syne . ''::::beneath
With that word he fell silent , thinking , I doubt not , of his home , as I did of mine , <<target>> of the house of Pitcullo and the ash-tree at the door , and the sea beyond the ploughed land of the plain .::::and
So , after some space of silence , he went to his bed , and I to mine , where for long I lay <<target>> , painting on the dark the face of Elliot , and her blue eyes , and remembering her merry , changeful ways .::::wakeful
Betimes in the morning I was awakened by the sound of her moving about through the house , and having dressed <<target>> gone forth from my little chamber , I found her in the house-place , she having come from early Mass .::::and
She took little heed of me , giving me some bread and wine , the same as she and her father took ; and <<target>> was altogether less gay and wilful than she had been , and there seemed to be something that lay heavy on her mind .::::she
This pleased him not ill , and next I must grind colours to his liking ; and again he went about his business , while I <<target>> mind the booth , and be cap in hand to every saucy page that came from the castle with an order from his lord .::::must
Full many a time my hand was on my whinger , and yet more often I wished myself on the free road again , so that I were out of ill company , and assuredly <<target>> Lorrainer Maid , whatever she might be , was scarcely longing more than I for the day when she should unfurl her banner and march , with me at her back , to Orleans .::::the
For so irksome was my servitude , and the laying of colours on the ground of banners for my master to paint , and the copying of books of Hours <<target>> Missals , and the insolence of customers worse born than myself , that I could have drowned myself in the Vienne water but for the sight of Elliot .::::and
But the two gentlemen that had <<target>> her escort were staunch .::::been
Their names were Jean de Metz and <<target>> de Poulengy , good esquires .::::bertrand
Of me Elliot made ofttimes not much more account than of her jackanapes , which was now in very high favour , and <<target>> fat , so that , when none but her father could hear her , she would jest and call him La Tremouille .::::waxing
Yet I , as young men will , was forward in all <<target>> to serve her , and to win her grace and favour .::::ways
She was fain to hear of Scotland , her own country , which <<target>> had never seen , and I was as fain to tell her .::::she
And betimes I would say how fair were the maidens of our own country , and how any man that saw <<target>> would know her to be a Scot , though from her tongue , in French , none might guess it .::::her
And , knowing that she loved wildflowers , I would search for them and bring them to her , and would lead her to speak of romances which she loved , no less than I , and of pages who <<target>> loved queens , and all such matters as young men and maids are wont to devise of ; and now she would listen , and at other seasons would seem proud , and as if her mind were otherwhere .::::had
Young knights many came to our booth , and looked ill-pleased when I served them , and their <<target>> were ever on the inner door , watching for Elliot , whom they seldom had sight of .::::eyes
So here was I , in a double service , who , before <<target>> met Brother Thomas , had been free of heart and hand .::::i
But , if my master 's service irked me , in that other I found comfort , <<target>> I could devise with Elliot , as concerning our country and her hopes for the Maid .::::when
But my own hopes were not high , nor could I mark any sign that she favoured <<target>> more than another , though I had the joy to be often in her company .::::me
And , indeed , what hope could I have , being so young , <<target>> poor , and in visible station no more than any 'prentice lad ?::::and
It so fell out , how I knew not , whether I had shown me too presumptuous for an apprentice , or because of any other reason , that Elliot had much forborne my company , <<target>> was more often in church at her prayers than in the house , or , when in the house , was busy in divers ways , and I scarce ever could get word of her .::::and
Finding her in this mood , I also withdrew within myself , and was both proud and sorely <<target>> , longing more than ever to take my own part in the world as a man-at-arms .::::unhappy
I rose at her coming , doffing my cap , and told <<target>> , in few words , that my master had gone forth .::::her
Thereon she flitted about the chamber , looking at this and that , while I stood <<target>> , deeming that she used me in a sort scarce becoming my blood and lineage .::::silent
Suddenly she said , without turning round , for she was standing <<target>> a table gazing at the pictures in a Book of Hours --::::by
`` I have <<target>> her ! ''::::seen
`` The Pucelle ? -- do you <<target>> of her , gentle maid ? ''::::speak
`` I saw her and spoke to her , and heard her voice '' ; <<target>> here her own broke , and I guessed that she was near to weeping .::::and
I passed into the chapel of St. Martin on the cliff , and <<target>> heard the voice of one praying before the image of Our Lady .::::there
The voice was even as you said <<target>> day -- the sweetest of voices .::::that
I knelt beside her , and prayed <<target>> for her and for France .::::aloud
She rested her hand on my hair -- her hair is <<target>> , and cut 'en ronde ' like a man 's .::::black
It is true that they say , <<target>> dresses in man 's garb .::::she
Then she wept , and she kissed me ; she is to <<target>> me here to- morrow , la fille de Dieu -- ''::::visit
She drew a long sob , and struck her hand hard on the table ; <<target>> , keeping her back ever towards me , she fled swiftly from the room .::::then
Now I guessed that , if I was ever to win her , it <<target>> be through this Pucelle , on whom her mind was so strangely bent .::::must
Something also I dreamed , as young men will who have read many romances , of myself made a knight for great feats of arms , and wearing <<target>> my salade my lady 's favour , and breaking a spear on Talbot , or Fastolf , or Glasdale , in some last great victory for France .::::in
Then shone on my eyesight , as it were , the picture of these two children , for they were little more , Elliot and the Maid , kneeling together <<target>> the chapel of St. Martin , the gold hair and the black blended ; and what were they two alone against this world and the prince of this world ?::::in
Alas , how much , and again <<target>> little , doth prayer avail us !::::how
These thoughts were in my mind all day , while serving and answering customers , and carrying my master 's wares about the town , and <<target>> to the castle on the cliff , where the soldiers and sentries now knew me well enough , and the Scots archers treated me kindly .::::up
But as for Elliot , she was like her first self again , and merrier than common with her father , to whom , as far as my <<target>> went , she said not a word about the meeting in the crypt of St. Martin 's chapel , though to me she had spoken so freely .::::knowledge
This gave me some hope ; but when I would have tried to ask her a question , she <<target>> gazed at me in a manner that abashed me , and turned off to toy with her jackanapes .::::only
Whereby I went to my bed perplexed , and with a heavy heart , as one that was not yet conversant with the <<target>> of women -- nay , nor ever , in my secular life , have I understood what they would be at .::::ways
Happier had it been for my temporal life if <<target>> had been wiser in woman 's ways .::::i
But commonly , when we have learned a <<target>> , the lore comes too late .::::lesson
Next day my master had business at the castle with a certain <<target>> , and took me thither to help in carrying his wares .::::lord
This castle was a place that I loved well , it is so old , having first been builded when the Romans were lords of <<target>> land ; and is so great and strong that our bishop 's castle of St. Andrews seems but a cottage compared to it .::::the
From the hill-top there is a wide prospect over the tower and <<target>> valley of the Vienne , which I liked to gaze upon .::::the
My master , then , went in by the drawbridge , high above the moat , which is so <<target>> that , I trow , no foeman could fill it up and cross it to assail the walls .::::deep
My master , in limping up the hill , had wearied himself , but soon passed into the castle through the gateway of the bell-tower , as they call <<target>> , while I waited for him on the further end of the bridge , idly dropping morsels of bread to the swans that swam in the moat below .::::it
On the drawbridge , standing sentinel , was a French man-at-arms , a young man of my own age , armed with <<target>> long fauchard , which we call a bill or halberd , a weapon not unlike the Lochaber axes of the Highlandmen .::::a
Other soldiers , French , Scottish , Spaniards , Germans , a <<target>> company , were idling and dicing just within the gate .::::mixed
I was throwing my last piece of crust to a swan , my mind empty of thought , when <<target>> started out of my dream , hearing that rare woman 's voice which once I had heard before .::::i
Then turning quickly , I saw , walking between two gentlemen , even those who had ridden with her <<target>> Vaucouleurs , one whom no man could deem to be other than that much-talked- of Maid of Lorraine .::::from
{ 10 } In stature she was something above the common height of women , her face brown with sun and <<target>> , her eyes great , grey , and beautiful , beneath black brows , her lips red and smiling .::::wind
In figure she seemed strong and shapely , but so slim -- she being but seventeen years of age -- that , were it not for her sweet girl 's voice , and for <<target>> beauty of her grey eyes , she might well have passed for a page , her black hair being cut `` en ronde , '' as was and is the fashion among men-at-arms .::::the
Thus much have I written concerning her bodily aspect , because many have asked me <<target>> manner of woman was the blessed Maid , and whether she was beautiful .::::what
I gazed at her like one moon-struck , then , remembering my courtesy , I doffed my cap , and louted low ; <<target>> she bowed , smiling graciously like a great lady , but with such an air as if her mind was far away .::::and
She passed , with her two gentlemen , but the <<target>> sentinel barred the way , holding his fauchard thwartwise .::::french
he cried , in <<target>> rude voice .::::a
`` By the Dauphin 's gracious command , to see the <<target>> , '' said one of the gentlemen right courteously .::::dauphin
The fellow looked at the seal , and could <<target>> but acknowledge the arms of France thereon .::::not
`` So this is the renowned Pucelle , '' <<target>> cried ; `` by God 's name '' .::::he
and here he spoke words such as I may not <<target>> down in writing , blaspheming God and the Maid .::::set
She turned and looked at him , but as if she saw him not ; and then , a light of joy and love transfiguring her face , she <<target>> down on the drawbridge , folding her hands , her face bowed , and so abode while one might count twenty , we that beheld her being amazed .::::knelt
`` Sir , how canst thou take in vain the name of <<target>> , thou that art in this very hour to die ? ''::::god
So speaking , she with her gentlemen went within the gate , while <<target>> soldier stood gazing after her like a man turned to stone .::::the
The Maid passed from our sight , and then the sentinel , coming to <<target>> , turned in great wrath on me , who stood hard by .::::himself
`` What make you gaping here , <<target>> lousy wine-sack of Scotland ? ''::::you
he cried ; and at the word , my prayer which I had made to St. Andrew in my <<target>> came into my mind , namely , that I should not endure to hear my country defamed .::::bonds
I stopped not to think of words , wherein I never had a ready wit , but his were still in <<target>> mouth when I had leaped within his guard , so that he might not swing out his long halberd .::::his
`` Blasphemer and <<target>> ! ''::::liar
I cried , gripping his neck with my left hand , while with two up-cuts of my right I <<target>> his lies down his throat in company , as I deem , with certain of his teeth .::::sent
He dropped his halberd against the wooden fence of <<target>> bridge , and felt for his dagger .::::the
I caught at his right hand with mine ; cries <<target>> in my ears -- St. Denis for France !::::were
St. Andrew for Scotland ! -- as the other men <<target>> guard came running forth to see the sport .::::on
We gripped and swayed for a moment , then the staff of his fauchard coming between his legs , he tripped and fell , I above him ; our weight soused against the <<target>> pales of the bridge side , that were crazy and old ; there was a crash , and I felt myself in mid-air , failing to the moat far below us .::::low
Down and down I whirled , and <<target>> the deep water closed over me .::::then
Down and down I sank , the water surging up into my nostrils and sounding in my <<target>> ; but , being in water , I was safe if it were but deep enough .::::ears
Presently I struck out , and , with a <<target>> or two , came to the surface .::::stroke
But no sooner did my head show above , and I draw a deep breath or twain , looking for <<target>> enemy , than an arbalest bolt cleft the water with a clipping sound , missing me but narrowly .::::my
I had but time to see that there was a tumult on the bridge , and swords out ( the <<target>> , as I afterwards heard , knocking up the arbalests that the French soldiers levelled at me ) .::::scots
Then I dived again , and swam under water , making towards the <<target>> and the castle rock , which ran sheer down to the moat .::::right
This course I chose because I had often noted , from the drawbridge , a jutting <<target>> of rock , behind which , at least , I should be out of arrow-shot .::::buttress
My craft was to give myself all the semblance of a drowning man , throwing up my arms , when I <<target>> to see whereabout I was and to take breath , as men toss their limbs who can not swim .::::rose
On the second time of rising thus , I <<target>> myself close to the jut of rock .::::saw
My next dive took me behind it , and I let down my feet , close under the side of this <<target>> buttress , to look around , being myself now concealed from the sight of those who were on the bridge .::::natural
To my surprise I touched bottom , for I <<target>> deemed that the water was very deep thereby .::::had
Next I found that I was standing on a step of hewn stone , and that a concealed staircase , cut in the rock , goes <<target>> , in that place , to the very bottom of the moat ; for what purpose I know not , but so it is .::::down
{ 11 } I climbed up the steps , shook myself , and wrung the water out of my hair , <<target>> about the while for any sign of my enemy , who had blasphemed against my country and the Maiden .::::looking
But there was nothing to see on the <<target>> save my own cloth cap floating .::::water
On the other side of the fosse , howbeit , men were launching a pleasure-boat , <<target>> lay by a stair at the foot of the further wall of the fosse .::::which
There I stopped , deeming that <<target>> wicket must be locked .::::the
The men were now rowing the boat into the middle of the water , <<target>> , without expecting to find the gate open , I tried the handle .::::so
It turned , to my no little amazement ; the gate swang lightly aside , as if its hinges <<target>> been newly oiled , and I followed the staircase , creeping up the slimy steps in the half-dark .::::had
Up and round I went , till I was wellnigh giddy , and then <<target>> tripped and reeled so that my body struck against a heavy ironed door .::::i
Under my weight it yielded gently , and I stumbled across the threshold of a room that smelled strangely <<target>> and was very warm , being full of the sun , and the heat of a great fire .::::sweet
`` Is that you , <<target>> of my heart ? ''::::robin
said a girl 's voice in French ; and , before I <<target>> move , a pair of arms were round my neck .::::could
Back she leaped , finding me all wet , and not the man she looked for ; <<target>> there we both stood , in a surprise that prevented either of us from speaking .::::and
She was a pretty lass , with brown hair and bright red cheeks , and was dressed all in white , being , indeed , one of <<target>> laundresses of the castle ; and this warm room , fragrant with lavender , whereinto I had stumbled , was part of the castle laundry .::::the
A mighty fire was burning , and all the tables were covered with <<target>> and flat baskets of white linen , sweet with scented herbs .::::piles
Back the maid stepped towards the door , keeping her eyes on mine ; and , as she did not scream , <<target>> deemed that none were within hearing : wherein I was wrong , and she had another reason for holding her peace .::::i
`` Save me , gentle maid , if you may , '' I cried at last , falling on my knees , <<target>> where I stood : `` I am a luckless man , and stand in much peril of my life . ''::::just
`` In sooth you do , '' she said , `` <<target>> Robert Lindsay of the Scottish Archers finds you here .::::if
He loves not that another should take <<target>> place at a tryst . ''::::his
`` Maiden , '' I said , beginning to understand why the gate was unlocked , and wherefore it went so <<target>> on its hinges , `` I fear I have slain a man , one of the King 's archers .::::smooth
We wrestled together on the drawbridge , and the palisade breaking , we <<target>> into the moat , whence I clomb by the hidden stairs . ''::::fell
`` One of <<target>> archers ! ''::::the
cried she , as pale as a lily , <<target>> catching at her side with her hand .::::and
`` Was he <<target>> Scot ? ''::::a
`` No , maid , but I am ; and I pray you hide me , or <<target>> me how to escape from this castle with my life , and that speedily . ''::::show
`` The other maids are at their dinner , '' she went on , `` and I all <<target>> -- the season being Lent , and I under penance , and thinking of no danger . ''::::alone
For which reason , I doubt not , namely that the others had gone <<target>> , she had made her tryst at this hour with Robin Lindsay .::::forth
But he , if he was , as she said , one of the Scottish archers that guarded the gate , <<target>> busy enough belike with the tumult on the bridge , or in seeking for the body of mine enemy .::::was
`` How to get you forth I know not , '' she said , `` seeing that from yonder room you pass into the kitchen and thence into the guard-room , and thence again by a passage in the <<target>> behind the great hall , and so forth to the court , and through the gate , and thereby there is no escape : for see you the soldiers must , and will avenge their comrade . ''::::wall
Hearing this speech , I seemed to behold myself swinging by a tow <<target>> a tree branch , a death not beseeming one of gentle blood .::::from
Up and down I looked , in vain , and then I turned to the window , thinking that , as better was not <<target>> be , I might dive thence into the moat , and take my chance of escape by the stairs on the further side .::::to
But the window <<target>> heavily barred .::::was
Yet again , if I went forth by the door , and lurked on the postern stair , there <<target>> Robin Lindsay 's dirk to reckon with , when he came , a laggard , to his love-tryst .::::was
I have it , '' said the girl ; and flying into the laundry , she returned with a great bundle of <<target>> women 's gear and a gown of linen , and a woman 's white coif , such as she herself wore .::::white
`` A pretty wench you make , I swear by St. Valentine , '' cried she , falling back to <<target>> at me , and then coming forward to pin up something about my coif , with her white fingers .::::look
I reckoned it no harm to <<target>> her a sisterly kiss .::::offer
`` 'T is lucky Robin Lindsay is late , '' cried she , laughing , `` though <<target>> were he here , he could scarce find fault that one maid should kiss another .::::even
Only speak as little as may be , <<target>> your speech may betray you . ''::::for
She kissed me very kindly on both cheeks , for she was <<target>> frank a lass as ever I met , and a merry .::::as
Then , leading me to the door of the inner room , she <<target>> it open , the savoury reek of the kitchen pouring in .::::pushed
she cried aloud after me , so that all could hear ; and I walked straight up the King 's kitchen , full as it was of men and boys , breaking salads , spitting fowls , <<target>> meat ( though it was Lent , but doubtless the King had a dispensation for his health 's sake ) , watching pots , tasting dishes , and all in a great bustle and clamour .::::basting
Through the room I went , none regarding me , and <<target>> into the guard-room , but truly this was another matter .::::so
Some soldiers were dicing at a table , some drinking , some brawling over <<target>> matter of the late tumult , but all stopped and looked at me .::::the
said a voice in the <<target>> of my own country .::::accent
`` But she has mighty big feet ; belike she is a countrywoman of thine , '' quoth a <<target>> archer ; and my heart sank within me as the other cast a tankard at his head .::::french
Never came man nearer getting a sore <<target>> , yet I held my hand .::::buffet
Then , making his cast with the dice , he swore <<target>> , when he saw that he had thrown deuces .::::roundly
Lug out your losings , '' said his adversary with a laugh ; and <<target>> man left hold of my waist and began fumbling in his pouch .::::the
`` Leave the wench alone ; she is new come , I warrant , and has no liking for your wantonness , '' said a kind <<target>> ; and , glancing up , I saw that he who spoke was one of the gentlemen who had ridden with the Maiden from Vaucouleurs .::::voice
Bertrand de Poulengy was his name ; belike he was waiting while the <<target>> and the nobles devised with the Maiden privately in the great hall .::::king
He stooped and helped me to pick up my linen , as courteously as if I had been a princess of the blood ; and , because he was a gentleman , I <<target>> , and a stranger , the archers did not meddle with him , save to break certain soldiers ' jests , making me glad that I was other than I appeared .::::suppose
`` Come , '' he said , `` my lass , I will be your <<target>> ; it seems that Fortune has chosen me for a champion of dames . ''::::escort
With these words he led the way forth , and through a long passage lit from <<target>> , which came out into the court at the stairs of the great hall .::::above
Down these stairs the Maiden herself was going , her face held high and <<target>> glad look in her eyes , her conference with the King being ended .::::a
Poulengy joined her ; they said some words which I did not hear , for I deemed that it became me to <<target>> forward after thanking him by a look , and bending my head , for I dared not trust my foreign tongue .::::walk
Before I reached the gateway they had joined me , which <<target>> was glad of , fearing more insolence from the soldiers .::::i
But these men held their peace , looking grave , and even affrighted , being <<target>> them who had heard the prophecy of the Maiden and seen its fulfilment .::::of
`` Have ye found the <<target>> of that man ? ''::::body
said Poulengy to <<target>> sergeant-at-arms .::::a
`` Nay , sir , we deem that his armour weighed him down , for he <<target>> rose once , though that Scot 's head was seen thrice and no more .::::never
Belike they are good , peaceful friends at <<target>> bottom of the fosse together . ''::::the
`` Of what man <<target>> you ? ''::::speak
asked the Maiden <<target>> Poulengy .::::of
`` Of him that blasphemed as <<target>> went by an hour ago .::::we
Wrestling with a Scot on some quarrel , <<target>> broke the palisade , and -- lo !::::they
there are joiners <<target>> mending it .::::already
'T is old <<target>> frail .::::and
The gentle Dauphin is over poor to keep the furnishings <<target>> his castle as a king should do . ''::::of
The Maiden grew wan as sun-dried grass in <<target>> when she heard this story told .::::summer
Crossing herself , <<target>> said --::::she
I warned him , <<target>> he died unconfessed .::::but
I will do what I may to have Masses said for the repose <<target>> his soul , poor man : and he so young ! ''::::of
With that she wept , for she wept readily , even for <<target>> less thing than such a death as was that archer 's .::::a
We had now crossed the drawbridge , whereat my heart beat more lightly , and the Maiden <<target>> Poulengy that she would go to the house where she lodged , near the castle .::::told
`` And thence , '' she said , `` I must fare into the town , for I have promised <<target>> visit a damsel of my friends , one Heliote Poulvoir , if I may find my way thither .::::to
Know you , gentle damsel , '' she <<target>> to me , `` where she abides ?::::said
Or perchance you can lead me thither , <<target>> it lies on your way . ''::::if
`` I was even going thither , Pucelle , '' I said , mincing in <<target>> speech ; whereat she laughed , for of her nature she was merry .::::my
`` Scots are Heliote and her father , and <<target>> Scot are not you also , damsel ?::::a
your speech betrays you , '' she said ; `` you all cling close together , you Scots , as beseems you well , being strangers in <<target>> sweet land of France '' ; and her face lighted up as she spoke the name she loved , and my heart worshipped her with reverence .::::this
`` Farewell , '' she cried to Poulengy , smiling graciously , and bowing with such a courtesy as a queen might show , for I noted it myself , as did all <<target>> , that this peasant girl had the manners of the Court , being schooled , as I deem , by the greatest of ladies , her friends St. Margaret and St. Catherine .::::men
Then , with an archer , who had ridden beside her from Vaucouleurs , following after her as he <<target>> did , the Maiden and I began to go down the steep way that led to the town .::::ever
Little she spoke , and all my thought was to enter <<target>> house before Elliot could spy me in my strange disguise .::::the
Her mind , belike , was on fire with a great light of hope , of which afterwards I learned , <<target>> the end of the days of trouble and of men 's disbelief seemed to her to be drawing near .::::and
We may not know what visions of victory and of auxiliary angels , of her King <<target>> , and fair France redeemed and at peace , were passing through her fancy .::::crowned
On my side I had more than enough to think of , for my <<target>> and present jeopardy were enough to amaze older and wiser heads than mine .::::case
For , imprimis , I had slain one of the King 's guards ; and , moreover , <<target>> struck the first blow , though my adversary , indeed , had given me uttermost provocation .::::had
But even if my enemies allowed me to speak in my own defence , which might scarcely be save by <<target>> , it was scantly possible for me to prove that the other had insulted me and my country .::::miracle
Some little hope I had that Sir Patrick Ogilvie , now constable of the Scottish men-at-arms in France , or Sir Hugh Kennedy , or some other of <<target>> knights , might take up my quarrel , for the sake of our common blood and country , we Scots always backing each the other when abroad .::::our
Yet , on the other hand , it was more probable that I might be swinging , with a flock of <<target>> pecking at my face , before any of my countrymen could speak a word for me with the King .::::crows
It is true that they who would most eagerly have sought my life deemed me already <<target>> , drowned in the fosse , and so would make no search for me .::::dead
Yet , as soon as I went about my master 's affairs , as needs I must , I would be known and <<target>> ; and , as we say in our country proverb , `` my craig would ken the weight of my hurdies . ''::::taken
{ 12 } None the less , seeing that the soldiers deemed me dead , I might readily escape at once from Chinon , and take to the roads again , if <<target>> I could reach my master 's house unseen , and get rid of this foolish feminine gear of cap and petticoat which now I wore to my great shame and discomfort .::::but
But on this hand lay little hope ; for , once on the road , I should be in a worse jeopardy <<target>> ever before , as an apprentice fled from my master , and , moreover , with blood on my hands .::::than
Moreover , I could ill brook the thought of leaving Elliot , to whom my heart went forth in love , and of missing my chance <<target>> strike a blow in the wars for the Maiden , and against the English ; of which reward I had the promise from my master .::::to
Here I sadly remembered how , with a light heart , I had left St. Andrews , deeming that the story of my life was <<target>> about to begin , as it did for many young esquires of Greece and other lands , concerning whom I had read in romances .::::now
Verily in the tale of my adventures hitherto there had been more cuffs than crowns , more shame than honour ; and , as <<target>> winning my spurs , I was more in point to win a hempen rope , and in my end disgrace my blood .::::to
Now , as if these perils were not enough to put a man beside himself , <<target>> was another risk which , even more than these , took up my thoughts .::::there
Among all my dangers and manifold distresses , this raised its head highest in my fancy , namely , the fear that my love <<target>> see me in my outlandish guise , clad in woman 's weeds , and carrying on my head a woman 's burden .::::should
It was not so much that she must <<target>> laugh and hold me in little account .::::needs
Elliot laughed often , so that now it was not her mirth , to which she was ever <<target>> , but her wrath ( whereto she was ready also ) that I held in awful regard .::::ready
And , if the Maid went in men 's attire ( as needs she must , for modesty 's sake , who was about men 's business , in men 's company ) , <<target>> was I attending her in woman 's gear , as if to make a mock of her , though in my mind I deemed her no less than a sister of the saints .::::here
And Elliot was sure to believe that I carried myself thus in mockery and to make laughter ; for , at that <<target>> , there were many in France who mocked , as did that soldier whose death I had seen and caused .::::time
Thus I stood in no more danger of death , great as was that risk , than in jeopardy of my <<target>> 's favour , which , indeed , of late I had been in some scant hope at last to win .::::mistress
Thus , on all hands , I seemed to myself as sore bestead as <<target>> man was , and on no side saw any hope of succour .::::ever
I mused so long and deep on these things , that the thought which might have helped me came to me <<target>> late , namely , to tell all my tale to the Maiden herself , and throw me on her mercy .::::too
Nay , even when at last and late this light shone on my mind , I had shame to speak to <<target>> , considering the marvellous thing which I had just beheld of her , in the fulfilment of her prophecy .::::her
But now my master 's house was in sight , at the turning from the steep stairs and the wynd , and there stood <<target>> on the doorstep , watching and waiting for the Maid , as a girl may wait for her lover coming from the wars .::::elliot
There was no time given me to slink back and skulk in the shadow of the corner of the wynd ; for , like a greyhound in speed , Elliot had flown to us and was kneeling to the Maid , who , with <<target>> deep blush and some anger in her face -- for she loved no such obeisances -- bade her rise , and so kissed and embraced her , as young girls use among themselves when they are friends and fain of each other .::::a
I had turned myself to go apart into the shadow of the corner , as secretly as I <<target>> , when I ran straight into the arms of the archer that followed close behind us .::::might
On this encounter he gave a great laugh , and , I believe , would have kissed me ; but , the Maiden looking <<target>> , he stood erect and grave as a soldier on guard , for the Maiden would suffer no light loves and daffing .::::round
`` Come , let me present you to this damsel , <<target>> friend -- and one of your own country- women .::::my
Do you thank her for me , and let her sit down in your house : she must be weary with the weight <<target>> her basket and her linen '' -- for these , when she spoke to me , I had laid on the ground .::::of
Suddenly a new look , such as I had never seen before on her face in her light angers , came into her eyes , which grew <<target>> and cold , her mouth also showing stiff ; and so she stood , pale , gazing sternly , and as one unable to speak .::::hard
`` Go out of my sight , '' she said , <<target>> low , `` and from my father 's house !::::very
Forth with you for a mocker <<target>> a gangrel loon ! ''::::and
-- speaking in our common Scots , -- '' and herd with the <<target>> thieves from whom you came , coward and mocking malapert ! ''::::base
The storm had fallen on my head , even as I feared it <<target>> , and I stood as one bereft of speech and reason .::::must
The Maid knew no word of our speech , and this passion of Elliot 's , <<target>> so sudden a change from kindness to wrath , were what she might not understand .::::and
`` Elliot , ma mie , '' she said , <<target>> sweetly , `` what mean you by this anger ?::::very
The damsel has treated me <<target>> no little favour .::::with
Tell me , I pray , <<target>> what she has offended . ''::::in
But Elliot , not looking at her , said to me again , and <<target>> time tears leaped up in her eyes -- '' Forth with you !::::this
begone , ere I call that archer to drag <<target>> before the judges of the good town . ''::::you
I was now desperate , for , clad as I was , the archer had me at an avail , and , <<target>> I were taken before the men of the law , all would be known , and my shrift would be short .::::if
`` Gracious Pucelle , '' I said , in French , turning to the Maiden , `` my life , <<target>> the fortune of one who would gladly fight to the death by your side , are in your hands .::::and
If I satisfy you not of my honour and good intent , I am ready , in this <<target>> , to go before the men of law , and deliver myself up to their justice .::::hour
For though my life is in jeopardy , I dread <<target>> less than the anger of this honourable demoiselle .::::death
And verily this is a matter <<target>> instant life or death . ''::::of
The Maiden had listened very gravely , and <<target>> she smiled when my prayer was ended .::::sweetly
Elliot , ma mie , you hear how gently , and <<target>> what distress , this fair lass beseeches us . ''::::in
cried Elliot : and then broke off between a sob <<target>> a laugh , her hand catching at her side .::::and
`` If you love me , '' said the Maid , looking on her astonished , and not without anger -- '' if you love me , as you have said , you <<target>> are the first of my comforters , and , till this day , my only friend in your strange town , let the lass come in and tell us her tale .::::that
For , even if she be distraught , and beside herself , as I well <<target>> , I am sent to be a friend of all them that suffer .::::deem
Moreover , ma mie , I have glad tidings for you , which I am longing to speak , but <<target>> it I will never , while the lass goes thus in terror and fear of death or shame . ''::::speak
In saying these last words , the fashion of her countenance was changed to a sweet entreaty and command , such as <<target>> could have beheld and denied her what she craved , and she laid her hand lightly on Elliot 's shoulder .::::few
`` Come , '' said Elliot , `` be it as you will ; come in with <<target>> ; and you '' -- turning to myself -- '' do you follow us . ''::::me
`` Let none enter , '' said the Maiden to her archer , `` unless any come <<target>> me from the King , or unless it be the master of the house . ''::::to
We passed into the chamber where my master was wont to <<target>> his missals and psalters when he would be alone .::::paint
`` Gracious Maiden , and messenger of the holy saints , '' she said , `` this lass , as you deem her , is no woman , but a man , my father 's apprentice , who has <<target>> himself thus to make of you a mockery and a laughing-stock , because that you , being a maid , go attired as a man , by the will of Them who sent you to save France .::::clad
Have I said enough , and do <<target>> well to be angry ? ''::::i
and her eyes shone <<target>> she spoke .::::as
`` Next , Ogilvie told how he had been in hall , with the Dauphin , <<target>> Chancellor Tremouille , and some scores of knights and nobles , a great throng .::::the
They were all waiting on this Lorrainer wench , for the Dauphin had been told , at <<target>> , that she brought a letter from Baudricourt , but before he would not see her .::::last
This letter had been kept from him , I guess by whom , and <<target>> was other clash of marvels wrought by her , I know not what .::::there
So their wisdom was set on putting her <<target>> a kind of trial , foolish enough !::::to
A young knight was dressed in jewels and a coronet of the King 's , and the King was clad right <<target>> , and held himself far back in the throng , while the other stood in front , looking big .::::soberly
So the wench comes in , and , walking straight through the press of knights , with her head <<target>> , kneels to the King , where he stood retired , and calls him 'gentle Dauphin ' !::::high
`` 'Nay , ma mie , ' says he , `` tis not I who am the Dauphin , but his <<target>> yonder , ' -- pointing to the young knight , who showed all his plumage like a muircock in spring .::::highness
`` Nay , gentle Dauphin , '' she answers , so Ogilvie said , `` it is to thee that I am sent , and <<target>> other , and I am come to save the good town of Orleans , and to lead thee to thy sacring at Rheims . ''::::no
`` Here they were all struck amazed , and the King not <<target>> , who then had some words apart with the girl .::::least
And he has given her rooms in the Tour Coudraye within the castle ; and the clergy and the doctors are to examine her straitly , whether she <<target>> from a good airt , { 15 } or an ill , and all because she knew the King , she who had never seen him before .::::be
Why should she never have seen him -- who warrants me of <<target>> ? -- she dwelling these last days nigh the castle !::::it
I served him , and he sat and chuckled in his <<target>> , being pleasured by the thought of his own wisdom .::::chair
`` Not a word of this to Elliot , though , '' he said suddenly ; `` when there <<target>> a woman in a house -- blessings on her ! -- it is anything for a quiet life !::::is
But , 'nom <<target>> ! '::::dieu
what with the fright you gave me , sitting there , whereas I deemed you were meat for eels and carp , and what with thy <<target>> -- ha , ha ! -- and my tale , and the wine , maybe , I forgot your own peril , my lad .::::tale
Now this was instant , for who knew how much the archer might have guessed , <<target>> followed with the Maid and me , and men-at-arms might anon be at our door .::::that
`` It may be , '' said I , `` that Sir Patrick Ogilvie and <<target>> Hugh Kennedy would say a word for me in the King 's ear . ''::::sir
`` Faith , that is our one chance , and , luckily for you , the lad you drowned , though in <<target>> King 's service , came hither in the following of a poor knight , who might take blood-ransom for his man .::::the
Had he been La Tremouille 's man , <<target>> must assuredly have fled the country . ''::::you
He took up his Book of Hours , with a <<target>> , and wrapped it again in its silken parcel .::::sigh
`` This must be your price with Kennedy , '' <<target>> said , `` if better may not be .::::he
It is like parting with the apple of my eye , but , I know not <<target>> how , I love you , my lad , and blood is thicker than water .::::well
Give me my staff ; I must hirple up that <<target>> hill again , and you , come hither . ''::::weary
He led me to his own chamber , where I had never been before , and showed me how , in the chimney-neuk , was <<target>> way into a certain black hole of little ease , wherein , if any came in search for me , I might lie hidden .::::a
There then , I sat , when I had eaten , my ears pricked to listen <<target>> the tramp of armed men below and the thunder of their summons at the door .::::for
But they came not , and presently my thought stole back to Elliot , who , <<target>> , was never out of my mind then -- nay , nor now is .::::indeed
But whether that memory be sinful in a man of religion or <<target>> , I leave to the saints and to good confession .::::not
Much I perplexed myself with marvelling why she did so weep ; above all , <<target>> I knew what hopeful tidings she had gotten of her friend and her enterprise .::::since
But no light came to <<target>> in my meditations .::::me
This mood , as was later seen , was Elliot 's , for her heart was like a <<target>> bird trapped , that turns with bill and claw on him who comes to set it free .::::wild
Moreover , I have since deemed that her passion of faith in the Maid made war on her love for me ; one breast being scantly <<target>> enough to contain these two affections , and her pride taking , against the natural love , the part of the love which was divine .::::great
Belike I had dropped asleep , outwearied with what had befallen me , mind and body , but I started up suddenly at the sound of <<target>> dagger-hilt smitten against the main door of the house , and a voice crying , `` Open , in the name of the Dauphin . ''::::a
They had come in quest of me , and when I heard them , it was as if a <<target>> had given my heart a squeeze , and for a moment my breath seemed to be stopped .::::hand
This past , I heard the old serving-woman fumbling with the bolts , and peering from behind the curtain of my casement , I <<target>> that the ways were dark , and the narrow street was lit up with flaring torches , the lights wavering in the wind .::::saw
I stepped to the wide ingle , <<target>> to creep into the secret hiding-hole .::::thinking
It might have served my turn if my escape alive from the moat had only been guessed , but now <<target>> master must have told all the story , and the men-at-arms must be assured that I was within .::::my
Thinking thus , I stood at pause , when a <<target>> came , as if from within the ingle --::::whisper
`` Unbar the door , <<target>> hide not . ''::::and
It must be Elliot 's voice , speaking through some tube <<target>> in the ingle of the dwelling-room below or otherwise .::::contrived
Glad at heart to think that she took thought of me , I unbarred the door , <<target>> threw myself into a chair before the fire , trying to look like one unconcerned .::::and
His face was pale , and falling into a <<target>> , he wiped the sweat from his brow .::::chair
`` Unhappy man that <<target>> am ! ''::::i
he said , `` I <<target>> lost my apprentice . ''::::have
I gulped something down in my throat ere I <<target>> say , `` Then it is death ? ''::::could
`` Nay , '' he <<target>> , and smiled .::::said
`` But gliff for gliff , { 16 } you put a <<target>> on me this day , and now we are even . ''::::fear
`` Yet I scarce need a cup of wine for my recovery , master , '' I said , filling him a beaker from the flagon on <<target>> table , which he drained gladly , being sore wearied , so steep was the way to the castle , and hard for a lame man .::::the
`` I have lost my prentice another way , '' <<target>> said , setting down the cup on the table .::::he
`` I had much a do to see Kennedy , <<target>> he was at the dice with other lords .::::for
At length , deeming there was no time to waste , I sent in the bonny <<target>> of Hours , praying him to hear me for a moment on a weighty matter .::::book
That brought him to my side ; he leaped at the book like <<target>> trout at a fly , and took me to his own chamber .::::a
There I told <<target>> your story .::::him
When it came to the wench in the King 's laundry , and Robin Lindsay , and you clad <<target>> girl 's gear , and kissed in the guard-room , he struck hand on thigh and laughed aloud .::::in
`` Then I deemed your cause as good as three parts won , and he could not hold in , but led me to a chamber where were many lords , dicing and drinking : <<target>> , Ogilvie , the Bishop of Orleans -- that holy man , who has come to ask for aid from the King , -- La Hire , Xaintrailles , and I know not whom .::::tremouille
There I must tell all the chronicle again ; and some said this , and some that , and Tremouille mocks , that the Maid uttered <<target>> prophecy to no other end but to make you fulfil it , and slay her enemy for the sake of her 'beaux yeux . '::::her
The others would hear nothing of this , and , indeed , though I am no gull , <<target>> wot that Tremouille is wrong here , and over cunning ; he trusts neither man nor woman .::::i
Howsoever it be , he went with the story to the <<target>> , who is keen to hear any new thing .::::king
And , to be short , the end of it is this : that you have your free pardon , on these terms , namely , that you have <<target>> score of masses said for the dead man , and yourself take service under Sir Hugh Kennedy , that the King may not lose a man-at-arms . ''::::two
Never , sure , came gladder tidings <<target>> any man than these to me .::::to
An hour ago the rope seemed tight about my neck ; one day past , and I was but a prentice to the mean craft of painting and limning , <<target>> good for a monk , or a manant , but , save for pleasure , not to be melled or meddled with by a man of gentle blood .::::arts
And now I was to wear arms , and that in the best of causes , <<target>> the best of captains , one of my own country -- a lord in Ayrshire .::::under
`` Ay , even so , '' my master said , marking the joy in my <<target>> , `` you are right glad to leave us -- a lass and a lameter .::::face
{ 17 } Well , well , such is <<target>> , and eld is soon forgotten . ''::::youth
I fell on my knees at his feet , and <<target>> his hands , and I believe that I wept .::::kissed
`` Sir , '' I said , `` you have been to me as a <<target>> , and more than it has been my fortune to find my own father .::::father
`` Ay , we shall both miss <<target>> betimes ; but courage , man !::::you
After all , this new life beseems you best , and , mark me , a lass thinks none the worse of a lad because he wears not the prentice 's <<target>> grey , but a Scots archer 's green , white , and red , and Charles for badge on breast and sleeve , and a sword by his side .::::hodden
`` Kennedy would have come near my price , <<target>> strove to make me take the gold .::::and
But what is bred in the bone will out ; I am a gentleman <<target>> , not a huckster , and the book I gave him freely .::::born
May it profit the good <<target>> in his devotions !::::knight
But now , come , they are weary waiting for us ; the <<target>> waxes late , and Elliot , I trow , is long abed .::::hour
You must begone to <<target>> castle . ''::::the
In the stairs , and about the door , some ten of Sir Hugh 's men were waiting , <<target>> countrymen of my own , and the noise they made and their speech were pleasant to me .::::all
They gave me welcome with shouts and laughter , and clasped my hands : `` for him that called us wine-sacks , you have given <<target>> water to his wine , and the frog for his butler , '' they said , making a jest of life and death .::::him
But my own heart for the nonce was heavy enough again , I longing to take <<target>> of Elliot , which might not be , nor might she face that wild company .::::farewell
He laid the book down when we entered , and the senior of the two <<target>> who accompanied me told him that I was he who had been summoned .::::archers
he asked ; and <<target>> gave it .::::i
`` You are of <<target>> blood ? ''::::gentle
And I answering `` Yes , '' he replied , `` Then <<target>> that you are ready to shed it for the King .::::see

Here we are strangers , and <<target>> men must be respected . ''::::my
He bowed his head : his words had been curt , <<target>> grace or kindness had he shown me of countenance .::::no
I felt in my heart that to him I <<target>> but a pawn in the game of battle .::::was
Now I seemed as far off as ever I was from my foolish dream of winning <<target>> spurs ; nay , perchance never had I sunk lower in my own conceit .::::my
Till this hour I had been , as it were , the hinge on which my share of the world turned , and <<target>> I was no more than a wheel in the carriage of a couleuvrine , an unconsidered cog in the machine of war .::::now
I was to be lost in a multitude , every one as good as myself , or better ; and when I <<target>> thought of taking service , I had not foreseen the manner of it and the nature of the soldier 's trade .::::had
My head , that I had carried high , somewhat drooped , as I <<target>> , imitating my companions , and we wheeled forth of the room .::::saluted
`` Hugh has taken the pride out of you , lad , or my name <<target>> not Randal Rutherford , '' said the Border man who had guided me .::::is
`` Faith , he has a keen tongue and a <<target>> way with him , but there are worse commanders .::::short
And now you must to your quarters , for <<target>> hour is late and the guard-room shut . ''::::the
He led me to our common sleeping-place , where , among many snoring men-at- arms in a great bare hall , a pallet <<target>> laid for me , and my flesh crept as I remembered how this was the couch of him whom I had slain .::::was
Howbeit , being well weary , despite the strangeness of the place , after <<target>> orisons I slept sound till a trumpet called us in the morning .::::brief
Seeing that I was come among rude neighbours , I even made shift to fall back , in semblance , on such manners as I had used among the students before I left <<target>> , though many perils , and the fear wherein I stood of Brother Thomas , and the company of the maid Elliot , had caused me half to forget my swaggering ways .::::scotland
So , may <<target>> forgive me !::::god
I swore roundly ; I made as if I deemed lightly of that Frenchman 's death , and , in brief , I so bore me that , ere noon ( when <<target>> behoved to go into Chinon with Randal Rutherford , and there provide me with the rich apparel of our company ) , I had three good quarrels on my hand .::::i
First , there was the man-at-arms who <<target>> kissed me in the guard-room .::::had
He , in a `` bourde '' and mockery , making pretence that he would repeat his insult , got that which was owing <<target>> , and with interest , for indeed he could see out of neither of his squint eyes when I had dealt with him .::::him
And for this cause perforce , if he needed more proof of my manhood than <<target>> weight of my fist , he must tarry for the demonstration which he desired .::::the
Then there was Robin Lindsay , and at his wrath I make no marvel , for the tale of how he came late to tryst , <<target>> at second-hand ( with many such rude and wanton additions as soldiers use to make ) , was noised abroad all over the castle .::::and
And now my practice of the sword at home and <<target>> lessons of our smith came handily to my need .::::the
After much clashing of steel and smiting out of sparks , I chanced , by <<target>> art known to me , to strike his sword out of his hand .::::an
Then , having him at an avail , I threw down my own blade , and so plainly told him the plain truth , and how to his mistress I <<target>> my life , which I would rather lose now at his hand than hear her honour blamed , that he forgave me , and we embraced as friends .::::owed
Neither was this jest anew cast up against either of us , men fearing <<target>> laugh , as we say , with the wrong side of their mouths .::::to
After this friendly bout at point and edge , Robin and Randal Rutherford , being off duty , must needs carry me to the Tennis Court , where Tremouille <<target>> the King were playing two young lords , and that for such a stake as would have helped to arm a hundred men for the aid of Orleans .::::and
`` May it not <<target>> spoken here ? ''::::be
I asked , for I was sorry to lose the spectacle of the tennis , <<target>> was new to me , and is a pastime wherein France beats the world .::::which
Pity it is that many players should so <<target>> and blaspheme God and His saints !::::curse
`` My business , '' replied the stranger , `` <<target>> of a kind that will hardly endure waiting . ''::::is
With that I rose and followed him out into the <<target>> courtyard , much marvelling what might be toward .::::open
`` You are that young gentleman , '' said my man , `` for a gentleman I take you to <<target>> , from your aspect and common report , who yesterday were the death of Gilles de Puiseux ? ''::::be
`` Sir , to my sorrow , and not by my will , I am he , and but now I was going forth <<target>> have certain masses said for his soul 's welfare '' : which was true , Randal Rutherford having filled my purse against pay-day .::::to
`` I thank you , sir , for your courtesy , and <<target>> may have occasion to do the like gentle service for you .::::perchance
Gilles de Puiseux was of my blood and kin ; he has none other to take up his feud for him in this place , <<target>> now your quickness of comprehension will tell you that the business wherewith I permit myself to break your leisure will brook no tarrying .::::and
Let me say that I take it not upon me to defend the words of my cousin , who insulted <<target>> woman , and , as I believe , a messenger from the blessed Saints that love France . ''::::a
I looked at him <<target>> some amazement .::::in
He was a young man of about my own years , delicately and richly clad in furs , silks , and velvets , <<target>> great gold chain hanging in loops about his neck , a gold brooch with an ancient Roman medal in his cap .::::a
But the most notable thing in him was his thick golden hair , whence La Hire had named him `` <<target>> , '' because he was so blond , and right keen in war , and hardy beyond others .::::capdorat
And here he was challenging me , who stood <<target>> him in a prentice 's hodden grey !::::before
`` Sir , '' I said , `` I could <<target>> you a better quarrel , but not more courtesy .::::wish
Many a gentleman seeing me such as I am , would bid me send , ere he crossed swords with me , to <<target>> own country for my bor-brief , { 18 } which I came away in too great haste to carry with me .::::my
`` Of body-armour take no thought , '' he answered , `` for this quarrel is of a kind that must needs <<target>> voided in our smocks '' ; he meaning that it was `` a outrance , '' till one of us fell .::::be
Verily , now I saw that this was not to be a matter of striking sparks <<target>> steel , as Robin and I had done , but of life and death .::::from
`` I shall be the more speedily at your service , '' I made answer ; and as <<target>> spoke Randal and Robin came forth from the `` dedans , '' the sport being over .::::i
They joined me , and I told them in few words my new business , my adversary tarrying , cap in hand , <<target>> I had spoken , and then proclaiming himself Aymar de Puiseux , a gentleman of Dauphine , as indeed my friends knew .::::till

Then , I with sword at side , like a gentleman , we made to the river , passing my master 's booth , where I looked wistfully at the windows <<target>> a blink of Elliot , but saw none that I knew , only , from an open casement , the little jackanapes mopped and mowed at me in friendly fashion .::::for

But , even as I struck , came a flash and the sudden deadness of a deep wound , for he had <<target>> feinted , and then , avoiding me so that I touched him not , he drove his point into my breast .::::but
Between the force of my own blow and this stab I fell forward on my face , and thence rolled over on my back , catching <<target>> my breast with my hands , as though to stop the blood , but , in sooth , not well knowing what I did .::::at
He had thrown down his sword , <<target>> now was kneeling by my side .::::and
`` I take you to witness , '' he said , `` that this has befallen to my great sorrow , and had I been where this gentleman was yesterday , and heard my cousin blaspheme , I would <<target>> have drawn on him , but -- '' And here , as I later heard , he fainted from loss of blood , my sword having cut a great vein ; and I likewise lost sense and knowledge .::::myself

Why have I alluded <<target>> this man ?::::to
I have alluded to him , Reader , because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised ; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day -- as <<target>> very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things ; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him , the terms which rightly characterise his talent .::::the

There was no possibility of <<target>> a walk that day .::::taking
We had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( Mrs. Reed , when there was no company , dined <<target>> ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out-door exercise was now out of the question .::::early
I was glad of it : I never liked long walks , especially on chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight , with nipped fingers and <<target>> , and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie , the nurse , and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza , John , and Georgiana Reed .::::toes
The said Eliza , John , and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room : she lay reclined on a <<target>> by the fireside , and with her darlings about her ( for the time neither quarrelling nor crying ) looked perfectly happy .::::sofa
Me , she had dispensed from joining the group ; saying , `` She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from Bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that I was endeavouring in <<target>> earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner -- something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were -- she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children .

Each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about <<target>> , and while she got up Mrs. Reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period I discovered ) from the pages of Pamela , and Henry , Earl of Moreland .::::it

`` It is well I drew the curtain , '' thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found <<target>> out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once --::::it

`` Say , 'What do you <<target>> , Master Reed ? ' ''::::want
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than I , for I was but ten : large and <<target>> for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .::::stout
He gorged himself habitually at table , which made him bilious , <<target>> gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks .::::and
He ought now to have been at school ; but his mama had taken him <<target>> for a month or two , `` on account of his delicate health . ''::::home
Miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned <<target>> an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John 's sallowness was owing to over-application and , perhaps , to pining after home .::::from
John had not much affection for his mother <<target>> sisters , and an antipathy to me .::::and
He bullied and punished me ; not two or three times in the week , nor once or twice in the day , <<target>> continually : every nerve I had feared him , and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near .::::but
Habitually obedient to John , I came up to his chair : he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging <<target>> roots : I knew he would soon strike , and while dreading the blow , I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it .::::the
I wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , <<target>> at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly .::::all
I tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired <<target>> a step or two from his chair .::::back

I did so , not at first aware what was his intention ; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it , I instinctively started aside <<target>> a cry of alarm : not soon enough , however ; the volume was flung , it hit me , and I fell , striking my head against the door and cutting it .::::with

I resisted all the way : a new thing for me , and a circumstance which <<target>> strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me .::::greatly
The fact is , I was a trifle beside myself ; or rather _out_ of myself , as the French would say : I was conscious that a moment 's <<target>> had already rendered me liable to strange penalties , and , like any other rebel slave , I felt resolved , in my desperation , to go all lengths .::::mutiny

They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed , and had thrust me upon a <<target>> : my impulse was to rise from it like a spring ; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly .::::stool

In guarantee whereof , I attached myself <<target>> my seat by my hands .::::to
`` Mind you do n't , '' said Bessie ; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding , she loosened her hold of <<target>> ; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms , looking darkly and doubtfully on my face , as incredulous of my sanity .::::me

Bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said -- '' You ought to be aware , Miss , that you are under <<target>> to Mrs. Reed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you off , you would have to go to the poorhouse . ''::::obligations
I had nothing to say to these words : they were not new to <<target>> : my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind .::::me

`` And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed <<target>> Master Reed , because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them .::::and

`` What we tell you is for your good , '' added Bessie , in no harsh voice , `` you should try to be useful and pleasant , <<target>> , perhaps , you would have a home here ; but if you become passionate and rude , Missis will send you away , I am sure . ''::::then
`` Besides , '' said Miss Abbot , `` God will punish her : He might <<target>> her dead in the midst of her tantrums , and then where would she go ?::::strike

The red-room was a square chamber , very seldom slept in , I might say never , indeed , unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead <<target>> rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained : yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion .::::hall
A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany , hung with curtains of deep red damask , stood out like a tabernacle in the centre ; the two large windows , with their blinds always drawn down , were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery ; <<target>> carpet was red ; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth ; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it ; the wardrobe , the toilet-table , the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany .::::the
Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high , and glared white , the piled- <<target>> mattresses and pillows of the bed , spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane .::::up
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed , also white , <<target>> a footstool before it ; and looking , as I thought , like a pale throne .::::with
This room was chill , because it seldom had a fire ; it was silent , because remote <<target>> the nursery and kitchen ; solemn , because it was known to be so seldom entered .::::from
The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays , to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week 's quiet dust : and Mrs. Reed herself , at far intervals , visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the <<target>> , where were stored divers parchments , her jewel-casket , and a miniature of her deceased husband ; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room -- the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur .::::wardrobe
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years : it was in this chamber he breathed his last ; here he lay in state ; hence his <<target>> was borne by the undertaker 's men ; and , since that day , a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion .::::coffin
I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door ; and <<target>> I dared move , I got up and went to see .::::when
yes : no jail <<target>> ever more secure .::::was
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality : and the strange little figure there gazing at me , with a white face and arms specking the gloom , and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still , had the <<target>> of a real spirit : I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms , half fairy , half imp , Bessie 's evening stories represented as coming out of lone , ferny dells in moors , and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers .::::effect
I returned to <<target>> stool .::::my
Superstition was with me at that moment ; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory : my blood was still warm ; the mood of the <<target>> slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour ; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present .::::revolted
All John Reed 's violent tyrannies , all his sisters ' proud indifference , all his mother 's aversion , <<target>> the servants ' partiality , turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well .::::all
Why could I <<target>> please ?::::never
Why was it useless to try <<target>> win any one 's favour ?::::to
Eliza , who was headstrong <<target>> selfish , was respected .::::and
Georgiana , who had a spoiled temper , a very acrid <<target>> , a captious and insolent carriage , was universally indulged .::::spite
Her beauty , her pink cheeks and golden curls , seemed to give delight <<target>> all who looked at her , and to purchase indemnity for every fault .::::to
I dared commit no fault : I strove to fulfil every duty ; and I was termed naughty <<target>> tiresome , sullen and sneaking , from morning to noon , and from noon to night .::::and
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received : no one had reproved John for wantonly <<target>> me ; and because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence , I was loaded with general opprobrium .::::striking
said my reason , forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power : and Resolve , equally wrought up , instigated some strange expedient to achieve <<target>> from insupportable oppression -- as running away , or , if that could not be effected , never eating or drinking more , and letting myself die .::::escape
What a consternation of soul <<target>> mine that dreary afternoon !::::was
Yet in what darkness , what dense <<target>> , was the mental battle fought !::::ignorance
I could not answer the ceaseless inward question -- _why_ I thus suffered ; now , at <<target>> distance of -- I will not say how many years , I see it clearly .::::the
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall : I was like nobody there ; I <<target>> nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children , or her chosen vassalage .::::had
If they did not love me , in <<target>> , as little did I love them .::::fact
They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them ; a heterogeneous thing , opposed to them in temperament , in capacity , in propensities ; <<target>> useless thing , incapable of serving their interest , or adding to their pleasure ; a noxious thing , cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment , of contempt of their judgment .::::a
I know that had I been a sanguine , brilliant , careless , exacting , handsome , romping child -- though equally dependent and friendless -- Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence <<target>> complacently ; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling ; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery .::::more
I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window , and the wind howling in the grove <<target>> the hall ; I grew by degrees cold as a stone , and then my courage sank .::::behind
All said I was wicked , and perhaps I might be so ; <<target>> thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death ?::::what
That certainly was a crime : <<target>> was I fit to die ?::::and
Or was the vault under the chancel <<target>> Gateshead Church an inviting bourne ?::::of
In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried ; and led <<target>> this thought to recall his idea , I dwelt on it with gathering dread .::::by
I could not remember him ; but I knew that he was my own uncle -- my mother 's brother -- that he had taken me when a parentless infant to <<target>> house ; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children .::::his
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise ; and so she had , I dare say , as well as her nature would permit her ; <<target>> how could she really like an interloper not of her race , and unconnected with her , after her husband 's death , by any tie ?::::but
It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent <<target>> a strange child she could not love , and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group .::::to
A singular notion <<target>> upon me .::::dawned
I doubted not -- never doubted -- that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly ; and now , as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls -- occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror -- I began to recall what I had heard of dead men , troubled in their graves <<target>> the violation of their last wishes , revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed ; and I thought Mr. Reed 's spirit , harassed by the wrongs of his sister 's child , might quit its abode -- whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed -- and rise before me in this chamber .::::by
I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs , fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural <<target>> to comfort me , or elicit from the gloom some haloed face , bending over me with strange pity .::::voice
This idea , consolatory in theory , I felt would be terrible if realised : <<target>> all my might I endeavoured to stifle it -- I endeavoured to be firm .::::with
Shaking my hair from my eyes , I lifted my head and tried to look <<target>> round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .::::boldly
Was it , I asked myself , a ray <<target>> the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?::::from
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , <<target>> as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world .::::prepared
My heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which I deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed <<target>> me ; I was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .::::near

I heard her sweeping away ; and soon after she was gone , <<target>> suppose I had a species of fit : unconsciousness closed the scene .::::i

I heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush <<target>> wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .::::of
Ere long , I became aware that some one was handling me ; lifting me up and supporting me <<target>> a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before .::::in
I rested my head against a pillow <<target>> an arm , and felt easy .::::or
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved : I knew quite well that I <<target>> in my own bed , and that the red glare was the nursery fire .::::was
It was night : a candle burnt on the table ; Bessie stood at the bed- foot with a <<target>> in her hand , and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow , leaning over me .::::basin
I felt an inexpressible relief , a soothing conviction of protection and security , when I knew that there was <<target>> stranger in the room , an individual not belonging to Gateshead , and not related to Mrs. Reed .::::a
Turning from Bessie ( though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot , for instance , would have been ) , I scrutinised the face of the gentleman : <<target>> knew him ; it was Mr. Lloyd , an apothecary , sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed a physician .::::i
`` Well , who <<target>> I ? ''::::am
I pronounced his name , offering him at the same time my hand : he <<target>> it , smiling and saying , `` We shall do very well by-and-by . ''::::took
Then he laid me down , and addressing Bessie , charged her <<target>> be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night .::::to
Having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : I felt so sheltered and befriended while he <<target>> in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .::::sat
`` Do you feel as if <<target>> should sleep , Miss ? ''::::you
asked Bessie , <<target>> softly .::::rather
Scarcely dared I answer her ; for I <<target>> the next sentence might be rough .::::feared
`` I will <<target>> . ''::::try
`` Would you like to drink , <<target>> could you eat anything ? ''::::or
`` No , thank <<target>> , Bessie . ''::::you
It emboldened me to <<target>> a question .::::ask
`` Bessie , what is <<target>> matter with me ?::::the
`` You fell sick , I suppose , in the red-room with <<target>> ; you 'll be better soon , no doubt . ''::::crying
Bessie went into the housemaid 's <<target>> , which was near .::::apartment
Missis was rather <<target>> hard . ''::::too
I caught scraps of their conversation , from which I was <<target>> only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed .::::able
`` Something passed her , all dressed in white , and vanished '' -- '' A great black dog behind him '' -- '' Three <<target>> raps on the chamber door '' -- '' A light in the churchyard just over his grave , '' & c. & c .::::loud
At last both slept : the <<target>> and the candle went out .::::fire
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red- room ; it <<target>> gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day .::::only
Yes , Mrs. Reed , to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering , but I ought to forgive you , <<target>> you knew not what you did : while rending my heart-strings , you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities .::::for
I felt physically weak and broken down : but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind : a wretchedness which <<target>> drawing from me silent tears ; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed .::::kept
Yet , I thought , I ought to have been happy , for none of the <<target>> were there , they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama .::::reeds
Abbot , too , was sewing in another room , and Bessie , as she moved hither and thither , <<target>> away toys and arranging drawers , addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness .::::putting
Bessie had been down into the kitchen , and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate , whose bird of paradise , nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds , had been wont to stir <<target>> me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration ; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely , but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege .::::in
This precious vessel was now placed on my knee , and I <<target>> cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it .::::was
coming , like most other favours long deferred <<target>> often wished for , too late !::::and
I could not eat the tart ; and the plumage of the bird , the tints <<target>> the flowers , seemed strangely faded : I put both plate and tart away .::::of
Bessie asked if I would have a book : the word _book_ acted as a <<target>> stimulus , and I begged her to fetch Gulliver 's Travels from the library .::::transient
This book I had again <<target>> again perused with delight .::::and
I considered it a narrative of facts , and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales : for as to the elves , having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells , under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks , I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth , that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker , and the population more <<target>> ; whereas , Lilliput and Brobdignag being , in my creed , solid parts of the earth 's surface , I doubted not that I might one day , by taking a long voyage , see with my own eyes the little fields , houses , and trees , the diminutive people , the tiny cows , sheep , and birds of the one realm ; and the corn-fields forest-high , the mighty mastiffs , the monster cats , the tower-like men and women , of the other .::::scant
Yet , when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand -- when I turned over its leaves , and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had , till now , never <<target>> to find -- all was eerie and dreary ; the giants were gaunt goblins , the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps , Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions .::::failed
I closed the book , which I dared no longer peruse , <<target>> put it on the table , beside the untasted tart .::::and
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room , and having washed her hands , she opened a certain little <<target>> , full of splendid shreds of silk and satin , and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana 's doll .::::drawer
Meantime she sang : <<target>> song was --::::her
`` In the days when we went <<target>> , A long time ago . ''::::gipsying
I had often heard the song before , and always with lively delight ; <<target>> Bessie had a sweet voice , -- at least , I thought so .::::for
She passed into another ballad , <<target>> time a really doleful one .::::this
`` My feet they are sore , and my limbs they are weary ; Long is the way , and the <<target>> are wild ; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child .::::mountains
Why did they send me so far and so lonely , <<target>> where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled ?::::up
Ev ' n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing , Or stray in the marshes , by false lights <<target>> , Still will my Father , with promise and blessing , Take to His bosom the poor orphan child .::::beguiled
There is a thought that for strength should avail me , Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ; Heaven is <<target>> home , and a rest will not fail me ; God is a friend to the poor orphan child . ''::::a
`` Come , Miss Jane , do n't <<target>> , '' said Bessie as she finished .::::cry
She might as well have said to the <<target>> , `` do n't burn ! ''::::fire
but how could she divine the morbid <<target>> to which I was a prey ?::::suffering
In the course of the <<target>> Mr. Lloyd came again .::::morning
`` What , <<target>> up ! ''::::already
said he , as <<target>> entered the nursery .::::he
`` Well , nurse , <<target>> is she ? ''::::how
Bessie answered that I <<target>> doing very well .::::was

`` No , <<target>> . ''::::sir

why , she is too <<target>> for such pettishness . ''::::old
The good apothecary appeared <<target>> little puzzled .::::a
I was standing before him ; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily : his eyes were small and grey ; not <<target>> bright , but I dare say I should think them shrewd now : he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face .::::very
Having considered me at <<target>> , he said --::::leisure
`` What made you <<target>> yesterday ? ''::::ill
`` She had a fall , '' said <<target>> , again putting in her word .::::bessie

As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket , a loud <<target>> rang for the servants ' dinner ; he knew what it was .::::bell
`` That 's for you , nurse , '' said he ; `` you can <<target>> down ; I 'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back . ''::::go
`` The fall did not make you <<target>> ; what did , then ? ''::::ill
pursued Mr. Lloyd when <<target>> was gone .::::bessie

I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and <<target>> at the same time .::::frown

`` Of Mr. Reed 's ghost I am : he <<target>> in that room , and was laid out there .::::died
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was <<target>> to shut me up alone without a candle , -- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it . ''::::cruel
And is it that <<target>> you so miserable ?::::makes
Are you afraid now <<target>> daylight ? ''::::in

How much I wished to <<target>> fully to this question !::::reply
How difficult it was <<target>> frame any answer !::::to
Children can feel , but they can not analyse their feelings ; and if the analysis is partially <<target>> in thought , they know not how to express the result of the process in words .::::effected
Fearful , however , of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it , I , <<target>> a disturbed pause , contrived to frame a meagre , though , as far as it went , true response .::::after
`` For one thing , I have no <<target>> or mother , brothers or sisters . ''::::father
`` You have a kind <<target>> and cousins . ''::::aunt
Again I paused ; <<target>> bunglingly enounced --::::then
`` But John Reed knocked me down , and <<target>> aunt shut me up in the red-room . ''::::my
Mr. Lloyd a second <<target>> produced his snuff-box .::::time
`` Do n't you think Gateshead <<target>> a very beautiful house ? ''::::hall
`` Are you not very thankful to have <<target>> a fine place to live at ? ''::::such
`` It is not my house , sir ; and Abbot says <<target>> have less right to be here than a servant . ''::::i

Have you any <<target>> besides Mrs .::::relations
`` None belonging to <<target>> father ? ''::::your

Poverty looks grim to grown people ; still more so to children : they have not much idea of industrious , working , respectable poverty ; they think of <<target>> word only as connected with ragged clothes , scanty food , fireless grates , rude manners , and debasing vices : poverty for me was synonymous with degradation .::::the
`` No ; I should not like to belong <<target>> poor people , '' was my reply .::::to
`` Not even if they <<target>> kind to you ? ''::::were
I shook my head : I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind ; and then to learn to speak like them , to adopt their manners , to be uneducated , to grow up like <<target>> of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead : no , I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste .::::one
`` But are your <<target>> so very poor ?::::relatives
Are they working <<target>> ? ''::::people
`` I can not tell ; Aunt Reed says if I have any , they <<target>> be a beggarly set : I should not like to go a begging . ''::::must
`` Would you like to <<target>> to school ? ''::::go
Again I reflected : I scarcely knew what school was : Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks , wore backboards , and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise : John Reed hated his school , and abused his master ; but John Reed 's <<target>> were no rule for mine , and if Bessie 's accounts of school-discipline ( gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead ) were somewhat appalling , her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were , I thought , equally attractive .::::tastes
She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed ; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play , <<target>> purses they could net , of French books they could translate ; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened .::::of
who knows what <<target>> happen ? ''::::may
said Mr. Lloyd , <<target>> he got up .::::as
`` The child ought to have change of air and scene , '' he <<target>> , speaking to himself ; `` nerves not in a good state . ''::::added
Bessie now returned ; at the same moment <<target>> carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk .::::the
`` Is that your <<target>> , nurse ? ''::::mistress
`` I should like to speak <<target>> her before I go . ''::::to
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed , I presume , from after-occurrences , that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school ; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted ; for as Abbot said , in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in <<target>> nursery one night , after I was in bed , and , as they thought , asleep , `` Missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill-conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand . ''::::the
Abbot , I think , gave me credit <<target>> being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes .::::for
On that same occasion I learned , for the first time , from Miss Abbot 's communications to Bessie , that my father had been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends , who considered the match beneath her ; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience , he cut her off <<target>> a shilling ; that after my mother and father had been married a year , the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated , and where that disease was then prevalent : that my mother took the infection from him , and both died within a month of each other .::::without
Bessie , when she heard this narrative , sighed and said , `` <<target>> Miss Jane is to be pitied , too , Abbot . ''::::poor
`` Yes , '' responded Abbot ; `` if she were a nice , pretty child , one might <<target>> her forlornness ; but one really can not care for such a little toad as that . ''::::compassionate
`` Not a great deal , to be sure , '' agreed Bessie : `` at any <<target>> , a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition . ''::::rate
`` Yes , I doat <<target>> Miss Georgiana ! ''::::on
`` Little darling ! -- with her long curls and her blue eyes , and such a sweet colour as she <<target>> ; just as if she were painted ! -- Bessie , I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper . ''::::has
`` So could I -- <<target>> a roast onion .::::with
Come , we 'll <<target>> down . ''::::go
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd , and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot , I gathered enough of hope to <<target>> as a motive for wishing to get well : a change seemed near , -- I desired and waited it in silence .::::suffice
It tarried , however : days and weeks passed : I had regained my normal state <<target>> health , but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded .::::of
Not a hint , however , did she drop about sending me to school : still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me <<target>> the same roof with her ; for her glance , now more than ever , when turned on me , expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion .::::under
Eliza and Georgiana , evidently acting according to orders , spoke to me as little as possible : John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me , and once attempted chastisement ; but as I instantly turned against <<target>> , roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before , he thought it better to desist , and ran from me tittering execrations , and vowing I had burst his nose .::::him
I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and when I saw that either that or <<target>> look daunted him , I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose ; but he was already with his mama .::::my
I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how `` that nasty Jane <<target>> '' had flown at him like a mad cat : he was stopped rather harshly --::::eyre
`` Do n't talk to me about her , John : I told you not to go near her ; she <<target>> not worthy of notice ; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her . ''::::is
Here , leaning over the banister , I cried out <<target>> , and without at all deliberating on my words --::::suddenly
`` They are not fit <<target>> associate with me . ''::::to
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , <<target>> crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .::::and
`` What would Uncle Reed say to <<target>> , if he were alive ? ''::::you
was my scarcely <<target>> demand .::::voluntary
I say scarcely voluntary , for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will <<target>> to their utterance : something spoke out of me over which I had no control .::::consenting
said Mrs. Reed under her breath : her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear ; she took <<target>> hand from my arm , and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend .::::her
I was now <<target>> for it .::::in
`` My Uncle Reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa <<target>> mama : they know how you shut me up all day long , and how you wish me dead . ''::::and
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , <<target>> boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .::::she
Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour 's length , in which she proved <<target>> a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof .::::beyond
I half believed her ; for I felt <<target>> only bad feelings surging in my breast .::::indeed
November , December , and <<target>> of January passed away .::::half
Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual <<target>> cheer ; presents had been interchanged , dinners and evening parties given .::::festive
When tired of this occupation , I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary <<target>> silent nursery : there , though somewhat sad , I was not miserable .::::and
To speak truth , I had not the least wish to go into company , for in company I was very rarely noticed ; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable , I <<target>> have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her , instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed , in a room full of ladies and gentlemen .::::should
But Bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to take herself off to <<target>> lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her .::::the
I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low , glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room ; and when <<target>> embers sank to a dull red , I undressed hastily , tugging at knots and strings as I best might , and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib .::::the
To this crib I always took my doll ; human beings must love something , and , in the dearth of worthier objects <<target>> affection , I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image , shabby as a miniature scarecrow .::::of
It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on <<target>> little toy , half fancying it alive and capable of sensation .::::this
I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown ; and when it lay <<target>> safe and warm , I was comparatively happy , believing it to be happy likewise .::::there
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company , and listened for the sound of Bessie 's step on the stairs : sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors , or perhaps to bring me something by way <<target>> supper -- a bun or a cheese-cake -- then she would sit on the bed while I ate it , and when I had finished , she would tuck the clothes round me , and twice she kissed me , and said , `` Good night , Miss Jane . ''::::of
When thus gentle , Bessie seemed to me the best , prettiest , kindest being in the world ; and I wished most intensely that she would always <<target>> so pleasant and amiable , and never push me about , or scold , or task me unreasonably , as she was too often wont to do .::::be
Bessie Lee must , I think , have been a girl of good natural capacity , for she was smart in all she did , <<target>> had a remarkable knack of narrative ; so , at least , I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales .::::and
She was pretty too , if my recollections <<target>> her face and person are correct .::::of
I remember her as a slim young woman , with black hair , dark eyes , very nice features , and good , clear complexion ; but she had a <<target>> and hasty temper , and indifferent ideas of principle or justice : still , such as she was , I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall .::::capricious
It was the fifteenth of January , about nine o'clock in the morning : Bessie was gone down to breakfast ; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama ; Eliza was putting on her bonnet <<target>> warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry , an occupation of which she was fond : and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained .::::and
She had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; <<target>> functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .::::that
; which interest she exacted every quarter , keeping <<target>> accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy .::::her
Georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with <<target>> flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .::::artificial
I was making my bed , having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned ( for Bessie now <<target>> employed me as a sort of under- nurserymaid , to tidy the room , dust the chairs , & c. ) .::::frequently
Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress , I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll 's house furniture scattered there ; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone ( for the tiny chairs and mirrors , the fairy plates and cups , were her property ) stopped <<target>> proceedings ; and then , for lack of other occupation , I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted , and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds , where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost .::::my
I watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to Gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom <<target>> was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door-bell rang loudly , the new-comer was admitted .::::i
All this being nothing to me , my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry <<target>> , which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement .::::robin
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table , and having crumbled a morsel of roll , I <<target>> tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill , when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery .::::was
`` Miss Jane , take off your <<target>> ; what are you doing there ?::::pinafore
Have you washed your hands <<target>> face this morning ? ''::::and
I gave another tug before I answered , for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread : the sash yielded ; I <<target>> the crumbs , some on the stone sill , some on the cherry-tree bough , then , closing the window , I replied --::::scattered
`` No , Bessie ; I <<target>> only just finished dusting . ''::::have
`` Troublesome , <<target>> child !::::careless
and what are <<target>> doing now ?::::you
You look quite red , as if you had been about <<target>> mischief : what were you opening the window for ? ''::::some
I would have asked who wanted me : I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was <<target>> ; but Bessie was already gone , and had closed the nursery-door upon me .::::there
I now stood in the empty hall ; before me was <<target>> breakfast-room door , and I stopped , intimidated and trembling .::::the
What a miserable little poltroon had fear , engendered of <<target>> punishment , made of me in those days !::::unjust
I feared to return to the nursery , and feared to go forward to the parlour ; ten minutes <<target>> stood in agitated hesitation ; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me ; I _must_ enter .::::i
`` Who could <<target>> me ? ''::::want
`` What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the <<target>> ? -- a man or a woman ? ''::::apartment
The handle turned , the door unclosed , and passing through and curtseying low , I looked up at -- a black pillar ! -- such , at least , appeared to me , at first <<target>> , the straight , narrow , sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug : the grim face at the top was like a carved mask , placed above the shaft by way of capital .::::sight
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside ; she made a signal to me to approach ; I did so , and <<target>> introduced me to the stony stranger with the words : `` This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you . ''::::she
_He_ , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where I stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which <<target>> under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , `` Her size is small : what is her age ? ''::::twinkled
was the doubtful answer ; and he <<target>> his scrutiny for some minutes .::::prolonged
Presently he addressed me -- '' <<target>> name , little girl ? ''::::your
In uttering these words I looked up : he seemed to me a tall gentleman ; but then I was very <<target>> ; his features were large , and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim .::::little
`` Well , Jane Eyre , and <<target>> you a good child ? ''::::are
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative : my <<target>> world held a contrary opinion : I was silent .::::little
Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding <<target>> , `` Perhaps the less said on that subject the better , Mr .::::soon

Not being in a condition to remove his doubt , I only cast my eyes down on <<target>> two large feet planted on the rug , and sighed , wishing myself far enough away .::::the

Now , uttered before a stranger , the accusation cut me to the heart ; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter ; I felt , though I could <<target>> have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst 's eye into an artful , noxious child , and what could I do to remedy the injury ?::::not
`` Nothing , indeed , '' thought I , as I struggled to repress a <<target>> , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .::::sob
`` Deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , '' said Mr. Brocklehurst ; `` it is akin to falsehood , and <<target>> liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , Mrs. Reed .::::all
I will speak to Miss <<target>> and the teachers . ''::::temple
`` I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects , '' continued my benefactress ; `` to be made <<target>> , to be kept humble : as for the vacations , she will , with your permission , spend them always at Lowood . ''::::useful
`` Your decisions are perfectly judicious , <<target>> , '' returned Mr. Brocklehurst .::::madam
`` Humility is a Christian grace , and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood ; <<target>> , therefore , direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them .::::i
I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; <<target>> , only the other day , I had a pleasing proof of my success .::::and
My second daughter , Augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : 'Oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls <<target>> Lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks -- they are almost like poor people 's children !::::at
`` This is the state of things I quite approve , '' returned Mrs. Reed ; `` had I sought <<target>> England over , I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre .::::all
Consistency , my dear Mr. Brocklehurst ; <<target>> advocate consistency in all things . ''::::i
`` Consistency , madam , is the first of Christian duties ; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood : plain <<target>> , simple attire , unsophisticated accommodations , hardy and active habits ; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants . ''::::fare
`` Madam , you may : she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants , <<target>> I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election . ''::::and
`` I will send her , then , as soon as possible , Mr. Brocklehurst ; for , I <<target>> you , I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome . ''::::assure
I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two : <<target>> good friend , the Archdeacon , will not permit me to leave him sooner .::::my
I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new <<target>> , so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her .::::girl
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn <<target>> a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .::::in
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone : some minutes passed <<target>> silence ; she was sewing , I was watching her .::::in
Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty ; she was a woman of robust frame , square-shouldered and strong-limbed , not tall , and , though stout , not obese : she had a somewhat large face , the under jaw being much developed and very solid ; her brow was low , her chin large and prominent , mouth and nose sufficiently regular ; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye <<target>> of ruth ; her skin was dark and opaque , her hair nearly flaxen ; her constitution was sound as a bell -- illness never came near her ; she was an exact , clever manager ; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control ; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn ; she dressed well , and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire .::::devoid
What had just passed ; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst ; the whole tenor of their conversation , was recent , raw , and <<target>> in my mind ; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .::::stinging
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work ; her eye settled on <<target>> , her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements .::::mine
`` Go out of the room ; return <<target>> the nursery , '' was her mandate .::::to
My look or something else must have struck her as <<target>> , for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation .::::offensive
I got up , I went to the door ; I came back again ; <<target>> walked to the window , across the room , then close up to her .::::i
_Speak_ I must : I had been trodden on <<target>> , and _must_ turn : but how ?::::severely
What strength had I to <<target>> retaliation at my antagonist ?::::dart
I gathered my energies and launched <<target>> in this blunt sentence --::::them
`` I am not deceitful : if I were , I should say I loved you ; but I declare I do not love you : I dislike you the worst of anybody in <<target>> world except John Reed ; and this book about the liar , you may give to your girl , Georgiana , for it is she who tells lies , and not I . ''::::the
Mrs. Reed 's hands still lay on her work inactive : <<target>> eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine .::::her
`` What more have <<target>> to say ? ''::::you
she asked , rather in the tone in which a person might address an <<target>> of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child .::::opponent
That eye of hers , that <<target>> stirred every antipathy I had .::::voice
Shaking from head to foot , thrilled <<target>> ungovernable excitement , I continued --::::with
`` I am glad you are no relation of mine : I <<target>> never call you aunt again as long as I live .::::will
I will never come to see you when I am grown up ; and if any one asks me how I liked you , and how <<target>> treated me , I will say the very thought of you makes me sick , and that you treated me with miserable cruelty . ''::::you
`` How dare you affirm <<target>> , Jane Eyre ? ''::::that
Because it is <<target>> _truth_ .::::the
You think I have no feelings , and that I can do without one bit of <<target>> or kindness ; but I can not live so : and you have no pity .::::love

And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked <<target>> struck me -- knocked me down for nothing .::::boy
I will tell anybody who asks <<target>> questions , this exact tale .::::me
People think you a good woman , <<target>> you are bad , hard-hearted .::::but
Because it is the <<target>> : p30.jpg }::::truth
It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst , <<target>> that I had struggled out into unhoped- for liberty .::::and
Not without cause was this sentiment : Mrs. Reed looked frightened ; her work had slipped from her knee ; she was <<target>> up her hands , rocking herself to and fro , and even twisting her face as if she would cry .::::lifting
Why do you <<target>> so violently ?::::tremble
Would you like to <<target>> some water ? ''::::drink
`` Is there anything else <<target>> wish for , Jane ?::::you
I assure you , I desire <<target>> be your friend . ''::::to
`` Deceit is not <<target>> fault ! ''::::my
I cried out in a <<target>> , high voice .::::savage
`` But you are passionate , Jane , that you must allow : and now return <<target>> the nursery -- there 's a dear -- and lie down a little . ''::::to
`` I am not your dear ; I can not lie down : send me <<target>> school soon , Mrs. Reed , for I hate to live here . ''::::to
It was the hardest battle I had fought , and the first victory I had gained : I stood <<target>> on the rug , where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood , and I enjoyed my conqueror 's solitude .::::awhile
First , I smiled to myself and felt elate ; but this fierce pleasure <<target>> in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses .::::subsided
A child can not quarrel with its elders , as I had done ; can not give its furious feelings uncontrolled <<target>> , as I had given mine , without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction .::::play
A ridge of lighted heath , alive , glancing , devouring , would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed : the same ridge , black and blasted after the <<target>> are dead , would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition , when half-an-hour 's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct , and the dreariness of my hated and hating position .::::flames
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time ; as aromatic wine it seemed , on swallowing , warm <<target>> racy : its after-flavour , metallic and corroding , gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned .::::and
Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed 's pardon ; but I knew , partly from experience and partly from <<target>> , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .::::instinct
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking ; <<target>> find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation .::::fain
I could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts <<target>> always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating .::::swam
I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room : the shrubbery was quite still : <<target>> black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .::::the
I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock , and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated ; but I found <<target>> pleasure in the silent trees , the falling fir-cones , the congealed relics of autumn , russet leaves , swept by past winds in heaps , and now stiffened together .::::no
I leaned against a gate , and looked into an empty field where <<target>> sheep were feeding , where the short grass was nipped and blanched .::::no
I stood , a wretched child enough , whispering to myself over and over <<target>> , `` What shall I do ? -- what shall I do ? ''::::again
All at once I heard a clear <<target>> call , `` Miss Jane !::::voice
It was Bessie , I knew well enough ; but I did <<target>> stir ; her light step came tripping down the path .::::not
`` You naughty <<target>> thing ! ''::::little
`` Why do n't you come <<target>> you are called ? ''::::when
The fact is , after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed , I was not disposed to care <<target>> for the nursemaid 's transitory anger ; and I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart .::::much
I just put my two arms round her <<target>> said , `` Come , Bessie !::::and
The action was more frank and fearless than any I <<target>> habituated to indulge in : somehow it pleased her .::::was
`` And wo n't you be <<target>> to leave poor Bessie ? ''::::sorry

Well , but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going <<target>> to tea this afternoon , and you shall have tea with me .::::out

`` Well , I will ; but mind you are a <<target>> good girl , and do n't be afraid of me .::::very
Do n't start when I chance to speak <<target>> sharply ; it 's so provoking . ''::::rather
`` I do n't think I shall ever be afraid of you again , Bessie , because I <<target>> got used to you , and I shall soon have another set of people to dread . ''::::have
`` If you dread them <<target>> 'll dislike you . ''::::they
`` I do n't dislike you , Miss ; I believe <<target>> am fonder of you than of all the others . ''::::i

What makes you so <<target>> and hardy ? ''::::venturesome
`` Why , I shall soon be away from you , and besides '' -- I was going to say something about what <<target>> passed between me and Mrs. Reed , but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head .::::had
`` And so you 're <<target>> to leave me ? ''::::glad
How coolly my little <<target>> says it !::::lady
I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you <<target>> n't give it me : you 'd say you 'd _rather_ not . ''::::would
Bessie stooped ; we mutually embraced , and <<target>> followed her into the house quite comforted .::::i
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony ; and in the evening Bessie told me <<target>> of her most enchanting stories , and sang me some of her sweetest songs .::::some
Even for me life had <<target>> gleams of sunshine .::::its
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January , when <<target>> brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed .::::bessie
I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes <<target>> the light of a half-moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .::::by
I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m. Bessie was the only <<target>> yet risen ; she had lit a fire in the nursery , where she now proceeded to make my breakfast .::::person
`` No , Bessie : she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper , and said I need not disturb her in the morning , or <<target>> cousins either ; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend , and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly . ''::::my
`` What did you <<target>> , Miss ? ''::::say
`` It was quite <<target>> , Bessie .::::right
do n't say <<target>> ! ''::::so
`` Good-bye to <<target>> ! ''::::gateshead
cried I , as we passed through the <<target>> and went out at the front door .::::hall
Raw and chill was the winter morning : my <<target>> chattered as I hastened down the drive .::::teeth
There was a light in the porter 's lodge : when we reached it , we found the porter 's wife just <<target>> her fire : my trunk , which had been carried down the evening before , stood corded at the door .::::kindling
It wanted but a few minutes of six , and shortly after that hour had struck , the distant roll of <<target>> announced the coming coach ; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom .::::wheels
`` Is she going <<target>> herself ? ''::::by
`` And how far <<target>> it ? ''::::is
`` What a <<target>> way !::::long
I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid <<target>> trust her so far alone . ''::::to
The coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guard and <<target>> loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted up ; I was taken from Bessie 's neck , to which I clung with kisses .::::coachman
`` Be sure and take good care of her , '' cried <<target>> to the guard , as he lifted me into the inside .::::she
`` Ay , <<target>> ! ''::::ay
was the answer : the door was slapped to , a <<target>> exclaimed `` All right , '' and on we drove .::::voice
Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead ; thus whirled away to <<target>> , and , as I then deemed , remote and mysterious regions .::::unknown
I remember but little of the journey ; I only know that the day seemed to me <<target>> a preternatural length , and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road .::::of
We passed through several towns , and in one , a very large one , the <<target>> stopped ; the horses were taken out , and the passengers alighted to dine .::::coach
I was carried into an inn , where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but , as I had no appetite , he left me in an <<target>> room with a fireplace at each end , a chandelier pendent from the ceiling , and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments .::::immense
Here I walked about for a long time , feeling very strange , and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in <<target>> kidnapping me ; for I believed in kidnappers , their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie 's fireside chronicles .::::and
At last the guard returned ; once more I was stowed away in the coach , my protector mounted his <<target>> seat , sounded his hollow horn , and away we rattled over the `` stony street '' of L- .::::own
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty : as it waned into dusk , I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead : we ceased to pass through towns ; the country changed ; <<target>> grey hills heaved up round the horizon : as twilight deepened , we descended a valley , dark with wood , and long after night had overclouded the prospect , I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees .::::great
Lulled by the sound , I at last dropped asleep ; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me ; the coach-door <<target>> open , and a person like a servant was standing at it : I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps .::::was
`` Is there a little girl <<target>> Jane Eyre here ? ''::::called
I answered `` Yes , '' and was then lifted out ; <<target>> trunk was handed down , and the coach instantly drove away .::::my
I was stiff with long sitting , and bewildered with the noise and <<target>> of the coach : Gathering my faculties , I looked about me .::::motion
Rain , wind , and darkness filled the air ; nevertheless , I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door <<target>> in it ; through this door I passed with my new guide : she shut and locked it behind her .::::open
I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall , when <<target>> door opened , and an individual carrying a light entered ; another followed close behind .::::the
She considered me attentively for a minute <<target>> two , then further added --::::or
she asked , placing her <<target>> on my shoulder .::::hand
`` And hungry too , no doubt : let her have <<target>> supper before she goes to bed , Miss Miller .::::some
Is this the first time you have left your parents <<target>> come to school , my little girl ? ''::::to
I explained to her that <<target>> had no parents .::::i
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine ; the one who went with me appeared <<target>> years younger : the first impressed me by her voice , look , and air .::::some
Miss Miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who <<target>> always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what I afterwards found she really was , an under-teacher .::::had
Seen by the dim light of the dips , their number to me appeared countless , though not in reality <<target>> eighty ; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion , and long holland pinafores .::::exceeding
It was the hour of study ; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow 's <<target>> , and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions .::::task
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door , <<target>> walking up to the top of the long room she cried out --::::then
`` Monitors , collect the lesson-books <<target>> put them away ! ''::::and
Four tall girls arose from different tables , and <<target>> round , gathered the books and removed them .::::going
Miss Miller again gave <<target>> word of command --::::the
`` Monitors , fetch <<target>> supper-trays ! ''::::the
The tall girls went out and returned presently , each bearing a tray , with portions of something , I <<target>> not what , arranged thereon , and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray .::::knew
The portions were handed round ; those who liked took a <<target>> of the water , the mug being common to all .::::draught
When it came to my turn , I drank , for I was thirsty , but did not touch the food , excitement and <<target>> rendering me incapable of eating : I now saw , however , that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments .::::fatigue
The meal over , prayers were read by Miss Miller , <<target>> the classes filed off , two and two , upstairs .::::and
Overpowered by this time with weariness , I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the <<target>> was , except that , like the schoolroom , I saw it was very long .::::bedroom
To-night I was to be Miss Miller 's bed-fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds , <<target>> of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep .::::each
I was too tired even to dream ; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts , <<target>> the rain fall in torrents , and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side .::::and
I too rose reluctantly ; it was bitter cold , and I dressed as well as I could for shivering , and washed when there was a basin <<target>> liberty , which did not occur soon , as there was but one basin to six girls , on the stands down the middle of the room .::::at
Again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs <<target>> entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by Miss Miller ; afterwards she called out --::::and
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes , during <<target>> Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed , `` Silence ! ''::::which
When it subsided , I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles , before four chairs , placed at the four tables ; all <<target>> books in their hands , and a great book , like a Bible , lay on each table , before the vacant seat .::::held
A pause of some seconds succeeded , filled up by the low , vague hum <<target>> numbers ; Miss Miller walked from class to class , hushing this indefinite sound .::::of
Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair , which was that nearest the door , and around which the smallest of <<target>> children were assembled : to this inferior class I was called , and placed at the bottom of it .::::the
By the time that exercise was <<target>> , day had fully dawned .::::terminated
The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and marched into another <<target>> to breakfast : how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat !::::room
I was now nearly sick from inanition , <<target>> taken so little the day before .::::having
The refectory was a great , low-ceiled , gloomy room ; on two long tables smoked basins of <<target>> hot , which , however , to my dismay , sent forth an odour far from inviting .::::something
I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow <<target>> ; from the van of the procession , the tall girls of the first class , rose the whispered words --::::it
The porridge is <<target>> again ! ''::::burnt
ejaculated a voice ; not that of Miss Miller , but one of the upper teachers , a little and dark personage , smartly dressed , <<target>> of somewhat morose aspect , who installed herself at the top of one table , while a more buxom lady presided at the other .::::but
I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before ; she was not visible : Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I <<target>> , and a strange , foreign-looking , elderly lady , the French teacher , as I afterwards found , took the corresponding seat at the other board .::::sat
A long grace was said and a hymn sung ; then a servant <<target>> in some tea for the teachers , and the meal began .::::brought
The spoons were moved slowly : I saw each girl taste her food and <<target>> to swallow it ; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished .::::try
Breakfast was over , <<target>> none had breakfasted .::::and
Thanks being returned for what we had not got , and a <<target>> hymn chanted , the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom .::::second
I was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge <<target>> taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered --::::and
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began , during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for <<target>> space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely , and they used their privilege .::::that
it was the sole <<target>> they had .::::consolation
Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room : a group <<target>> great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures .::::of
I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips ; at which Miss Miller shook her head <<target>> ; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath ; doubtless she shared in it .::::disapprovingly
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine ; Miss Miller left her <<target>> , and standing in the middle of the room , cried --::::circle
Discipline prevailed : in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into <<target>> , and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues .::::order
Ranged on benches down the sides of the room , the eighty girls sat motionless and erect ; a quaint assemblage they appeared , all with plain locks combed from their faces , not a curl visible ; in brown dresses , made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker <<target>> the throat , with little pockets of holland ( shaped something like a Highlander 's purse ) tied in front of their frocks , and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag : all , too , wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes , fastened with brass buckles .::::about
I was still looking at them , and also at intervals examining the teachers -- none of whom precisely pleased me ; for the stout one <<target>> a little coarse , the dark one not a little fierce , the foreigner harsh and grotesque , and Miss Miller , poor thing !::::was
looked purple , weather-beaten , and over-worked -- when , as my eye wandered from face <<target>> face , the whole school rose simultaneously , as if moved by a common spring .::::to
I had heard no order <<target>> : I was puzzled .::::given
Ere I had gathered my wits , the classes were again seated : but as all eyes were now turned <<target>> one point , mine followed the general direction , and encountered the personage who had received me last night .::::to
She stood at the bottom of the long room , on the hearth ; for there was <<target>> fire at each end ; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely .::::a
Miss Miller approaching , seemed to ask her a question , and having <<target>> her answer , went back to her place , and said aloud --::::received
While the direction was being executed , the <<target>> consulted moved slowly up the room .::::lady
I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration , for I retain <<target>> the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps .::::yet
Seen now , in broad daylight , she looked tall , fair , and shapely ; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids , and a fine pencilling of long lashes round , relieved the whiteness of her large front ; on each of her temples her hair , of a very dark brown , was clustered in round curls , <<target>> to the fashion of those times , when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue ; her dress , also in the mode of the day , was of purple cloth , relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet ; a gold watch ( watches were not so common then as now ) shone at her girdle .::::according
Let the reader add , to complete the picture , refined features ; a complexion , if pale , clear ; and a stately air and carriage , and he will have , at least , as <<target>> as words can give it , a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple -- Maria Temple , as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church .::::clearly
The superintendent of Lowood ( for such was this lady ) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables , summoned the first class round her , and commenced giving a lesson on geography ; the <<target>> classes were called by the teachers : repetitions in history , grammar , & c. , went on for an hour ; writing and arithmetic succeeded , and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls .::::lower
The duration of each lesson was measured by <<target>> clock , which at last struck twelve .::::the
`` I have a word to address <<target>> the pupils , '' said she .::::to
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking <<target>> , but it sank at her voice .::::forth
The teachers looked at her <<target>> a sort of surprise .::::with
`` It is to be done on my responsibility , '' she added , <<target>> an explanatory tone to them , and immediately afterwards left the room .::::in
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed , <<target>> the high delight and refreshment of the whole school .::::to
Each put on a coarse straw bonnet , with strings <<target>> coloured calico , and a cloak of grey frieze .::::of
The garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad <<target>> bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .::::walks
When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty ; but now , at <<target>> latter end of January , all was wintry blight and brown decay .::::the
The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in <<target>> verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .::::the
As yet I had spoken to no one , nor did anybody seem to take notice of me ; I <<target>> lonely enough : but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed ; it did not oppress me much .::::stood
I leant against a pillar of the verandah , drew my grey mantle close about me , and , trying to forget the cold <<target>> nipped me without , and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within , delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking .::::which
My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record : I hardly yet knew where I was ; Gateshead and my past life <<target>> floated away to an immeasurable distance ; the present was vague and strange , and of the future I could form no conjecture .::::seemed
I looked round the convent-like garden , and then up at the house -- a large <<target>> , half of which seemed grey and old , the other half quite new .::::building
The new part , containing the schoolroom and dormitory , was lit by mullioned and latticed windows , <<target>> gave it a church-like aspect ; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription : --::::which
`` Lowood Institution. -- This portion was rebuilt A.D. -- - , <<target>> Naomi Brocklehurst , of Brocklehurst Hall , in this county . ''::::by
`` Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good <<target>> , and glorify your Father which is in heaven . '' -- St .::::works
I read these words over and over again : I felt that an <<target>> belonged to them , and was unable fully to penetrate their import .::::explanation
I was still pondering the signification of `` Institution , '' and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first <<target>> and the verse of Scripture , when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head .::::words
I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near ; she was bent over a book , on the perusal of which she seemed intent : <<target>> where I stood I could see the title -- it was `` Rasselas ; '' a name that struck me as strange , and consequently attractive .::::from
In turning a leaf she happened to look <<target>> , and I said to her directly --::::up
`` Is your <<target>> interesting ? ''::::book
I had already formed the intention of asking <<target>> to lend it to me some day .::::her

`` What is <<target>> about ? ''::::it
I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger ; the step was contrary to my nature and habits : but I think her occupation <<target>> a chord of sympathy somewhere ; for I too liked reading , though of a frivolous and childish kind ; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial .::::touched
`` You may look at it , '' <<target>> the girl , offering me the book .::::replied
I did so ; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title : `` Rasselas '' looked dull <<target>> my trifling taste ; I saw nothing about fairies , nothing about genii ; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages .::::to

But at that moment the summons sounded <<target>> dinner ; all re-entered the house .::::for
I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and <<target>> shreds of rusty meat , mixed and cooked together .::::strange
Of this preparation a tolerably abundant <<target>> was apportioned to each pupil .::::plateful
I ate what I could , and wondered within myself <<target>> every day 's fare would be like this .::::whether
After dinner , we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom : <<target>> recommenced , and were continued till five o'clock .::::lessons
The only marked event of the afternoon was , that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah <<target>> in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class , and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom .::::dismissed
The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious , especially <<target>> so great a girl -- she looked thirteen or upwards .::::for
I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame ; but to my surprise she neither <<target>> nor blushed : composed , though grave , she stood , the central mark of all eyes .::::wept
`` How can she bear it <<target>> quietly -- so firmly ? ''::::so
`` Were I in her place , it seems to me <<target>> should wish the earth to open and swallow me up .::::i
She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment -- <<target>> her situation : of something not round her nor before her .::::beyond
I have heard of day-dreams -- <<target>> she in a day-dream now ?::::is
Her eyes are fixed on the floor , but I am sure they do not see it -- her sight seems turned in , <<target>> down into her heart : she is looking at what she can remember , I believe ; not at what is really present .::::gone
I wonder what sort of a girl she <<target>> -- whether good or naughty . ''::::is
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal , consisting of <<target>> small mug of coffee , and half-a-slice of brown bread .::::a
I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish ; but I <<target>> have been glad of as much more -- I was still hungry .::::should
Half-an-hour 's recreation succeeded , then study ; then the glass of <<target>> and the piece of oat-cake , prayers , and bed .::::water
Such was my first <<target>> at Lowood .::::day
The next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we <<target>> obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen .::::were
A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our <<target>> windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice .::::bedroom
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading <<target>> over , I felt ready to perish with cold .::::was
Breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was <<target>> burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small .::::not
How small my <<target>> seemed !::::portion
I wished it <<target>> been doubled .::::had
At first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and I was glad when , about three o'clock in the <<target>> , Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c. , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .::::afternoon
At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the <<target>> of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance .::::subject
It was English history : among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at <<target>> top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom .::::the
Even in that obscure position , Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of <<target>> notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : --::::constant
`` Burns '' ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys <<target>> elsewhere ) , `` Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . ''::::are
`` Burns , you poke your chin <<target>> unpleasantly ; draw it in . ''::::most
`` Burns , I insist on your holding your head up ; I will <<target>> have you before me in that attitude , '' & c. & c .::::not
A chapter having been read through twice , <<target>> books were closed and the girls examined .::::the
I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention ; <<target>> , instead of that , she suddenly cried out --::::but
you have never cleaned your <<target>> this morning ! ''::::nails
Burns made no answer : <<target>> wondered at her silence .::::i
`` Why , '' thought I , `` does she not explain that she could <<target>> clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? ''::::neither
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether I <<target>> ever been at school before , whether I could mark , stitch , knit , & c. ; till she dismissed me , I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd 's movements .::::had
When I returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import ; but Burns immediately left the class , and <<target>> into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end .::::going
This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , <<target>> her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs .::::unloosed
Not a tear rose to Burns ' eye ; and , while I paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at <<target>> spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression .::::this
exclaimed Miss Scatcherd ; `` nothing can correct you of <<target>> slatternly habits : carry the rod away . ''::::your
Burns obeyed : I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting <<target>> her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek .::::back
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer <<target>> in the morning -- its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty .::::than
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil , Burns , I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when I passed the windows , I now <<target>> then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside .::::and
Probably , if I had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when I should most <<target>> have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace !::::keenly
as it was , I derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , I wished the <<target>> to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour .::::wind
Jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , I made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , I <<target>> Burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers .::::found
I asked , <<target>> behind her .::::coming
`` Yes , '' she said , `` <<target>> I have just finished it . ''::::and
And in five minutes more <<target>> shut it up .::::she
I was glad <<target>> this .::::of
`` Now , '' thought I , `` <<target>> can perhaps get her to talk . ''::::i
I sat down by <<target>> on the floor .::::her
`` What is your <<target>> besides Burns ? ''::::name
`` Do you come a <<target>> way from here ? ''::::long
`` Will you ever <<target>> back ? ''::::go
`` I hope so ; but nobody <<target>> be sure of the future . ''::::can

`` Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , Mr. Brocklehurst <<target>> expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations .::::would

`` But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of <<target>> ; and you are such a great girl : I am far younger than you , and I could not bear it . ''::::people
`` Yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is <<target>> and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be required to bear . ''::::weak
I heard her with wonder : I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and <<target>> less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser .::::still
Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things <<target>> a light invisible to my eyes .::::by
I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the <<target>> deeply ; like Felix , I put it off to a more convenient season .::::matter
To me you seem <<target>> good . ''::::very
This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd , who <<target>> naturally neat , punctual , and particular . ''::::is
`` And cross and cruel , '' I added ; but <<target>> Burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence .::::helen
`` Is Miss Temple as severe <<target>> you as Miss Scatcherd ? ''::::to
At the utterance of Miss Temple 's name , <<target>> soft smile flitted over her grave face .::::a
`` Miss Temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees <<target>> errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if I do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally .::::my
One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me <<target>> my faults ; and even her praise , though I value it most highly , can not stimulate me to continued care and foresight . ''::::of
`` For _you_ I have <<target>> doubt it is .::::no
I observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : <<target>> thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you .::::your
Now , mine continually rove away ; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd , and collecting all she says <<target>> assiduity , often I lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream .::::with
Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland , and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden , near our house ; -- then , when <<target>> comes to my turn to reply , I have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , I have no answer ready . ''::::it
`` Yet how well you <<target>> this afternoon . ''::::replied
`` It was mere chance ; the subject on <<target>> we had been reading had interested me .::::which
This afternoon , instead of dreaming of Deepden , I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First <<target>> did ; and I thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown .::::sometimes
If he had but been able to look to a distance , and <<target>> how what they call the spirit of the age was tending !::::see
Yes , his enemies were the worst : they <<target>> blood they had no right to shed .::::shed

Helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten I could not very well understand <<target>> -- that I was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed .::::her
I recalled her <<target>> my level .::::to
`` Well , then , with <<target>> Temple you are good ? ''::::miss
`` Yes , in a passive way : I make <<target>> effort ; I follow as inclination guides me .::::no
There is no merit <<target>> such goodness . ''::::in
`` A great deal : you are good <<target>> those who are good to you .::::to
It is all I <<target>> desire to be .::::ever
If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their <<target>> way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse .::::own

`` But I feel this , Helen ; I must dislike those who , whatever I do <<target>> please them , persist in disliking me ; I must resist those who punish me unjustly .::::to
It is as natural as that I should love those who show me <<target>> , or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved . ''::::affection

In her turn , Helen Burns asked me to explain , and I proceeded forthwith to <<target>> out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments .::::pour
Bitter and truculent when excited , I spoke <<target>> I felt , without reserve or softening .::::as
Helen heard me patiently to the end : I expected she <<target>> then make a remark , but she said nothing .::::would
`` Well , '' I asked impatiently , `` is <<target>> Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ? ''::::not

No ill-usage so brands its <<target>> on my feelings .::::record
Would you not be happier if you tried to forget <<target>> severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ?::::her
Life appears to me too short to be <<target>> in nursing animosity or registering wrongs .::::spent
We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the <<target>> will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man -- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !::::spirit
Surely it will never , on the contrary , <<target>> suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ?::::be
Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with <<target>> creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end .

Helen 's head , always drooping , sank <<target>> little lower as she finished this sentence .::::a
I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk <<target>> me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts .::::to
She was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great <<target>> girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent --::::rough
`` Helen Burns , if you do n't go and put your drawer in order , and fold <<target>> your work this minute , I 'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it ! ''::::up
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age ; and not the golden age either ; <<target>> comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks .::::it
The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the <<target>> hardships of my lot ; though these were no trifles .::::physical
During January , February , and part of March , the deep snows , and , after their melting , the almost impassable roads , prevented our stirring <<target>> the garden walls , except to go to church ; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air .::::beyond
Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold : we had no boots , the snow got into our shoes and melted there : our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains , as were our <<target>> : I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening , when my feet inflamed ; and the torture of thrusting the swelled , raw , and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning .::::feet
Then the scanty supply of food was distressing : with the keen appetites of <<target>> children , we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid .::::growing
From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse , which pressed hardly on the younger pupils : whenever the <<target>> great girls had an opportunity , they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion .::::famished
Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time ; and after relinquishing to a third half the <<target>> of my mug of coffee , I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears , forced from me by the exigency of hunger .::::contents
Sundays were dreary days <<target>> that wintry season .::::in
We had to walk two miles to <<target>> Church , where our patron officiated .::::brocklebridge
It was too far to return to dinner , and an allowance of cold meat and bread , <<target>> the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals , was served round between the services .::::in
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road , where the bitter winter <<target>> , blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north , almost flayed the skin from our faces .::::wind
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line , her plaid cloak , which the frosty wind fluttered , gathered close about her , <<target>> encouraging us , by precept and example , to keep up our spirits , and march forward , as she said , `` like stalwart soldiers . ''::::and
The other teachers , poor things , were generally themselves <<target>> much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others .::::too
How we longed for the light and heat <<target>> a blazing fire when we got back !::::of
But , to the little ones at least , this was denied : each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a <<target>> row of great girls , and behind them the younger children crouched in groups , wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores .::::double
A little solace came at tea-time , in the shape of a double ration of bread -- a whole , instead of a half , slice -- <<target>> the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter : it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath .::::with
I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for <<target>> ; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with .::::myself
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating , by heart , the Church Catechism , and the fifth , sixth , and seventh chapters <<target>> St. Matthew ; and in listening to a long sermon , read by Miss Miller , whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness .::::of
The remedy was , to thrust them forward into the centre of the <<target>> , and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished .::::schoolroom
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst ; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of <<target>> first month after my arrival ; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon : his absence was a relief to me .::::the
I need not say that I had my own reasons for <<target>> his coming : but come he did at last .::::dreading
One afternoon ( I had then been three weeks at Lowood ) , as I was sitting with a slate in my hand , puzzling over a sum in long division , my eyes , raised in abstraction to the window , caught sight of a figure <<target>> passing : I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline ; and when , two minutes after , all the school , teachers included , rose _en masse_ , it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted .::::just
A long stride measured the schoolroom , and presently beside Miss Temple , who herself had risen , <<target>> the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead .::::stood
I now glanced sideways at <<target>> piece of architecture .::::this
Yes , I was right : it was Mr. Brocklehurst , buttoned up in <<target>> surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .::::a
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition ; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about <<target>> disposition , & c. ; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature .::::my
I listened too ; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the <<target>> , I caught most of what he said : its import relieved me from immediate apprehension .::::room
`` I suppose , Miss Temple , the thread I bought at Lowton will do ; it struck me that <<target>> would be just of the quality for the calico chemises , and I sorted the needles to match .::::it
I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to ! -- when I was here last , I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line ; there was a <<target>> of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time .

`` Well , for once it may pass ; but <<target>> not to let the circumstance occur too often .::::please
And there is another thing which surprised me ; I find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a <<target>> , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight .::::lunch
I looked over the regulations , and I <<target>> no such meal as lunch mentioned .::::find
and by what <<target>> ? ''::::authority
`` I must be responsible for the circumstance , sir , '' replied Miss Temple : `` the breakfast was so ill <<target>> that the pupils could not possibly eat it ; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time . ''::::prepared
`` Madam , allow <<target>> an instant .::::me
You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them <<target>> habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self-denying .::::to
Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur , such as the spoiling of a meal , the under or the over dressing of a dish , the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more <<target>> the comfort lost , thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution ; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils , by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation .::::delicate
A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed , wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians ; to the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself , calling upon His disciples to take up <<target>> cross and follow Him ; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ; to His divine consolations , `` If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake , happy are ye .

Mr. Brocklehurst again paused -- <<target>> overcome by his feelings .::::perhaps
Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her ; but she now gazed straight before her , and her face , naturally pale as marble , appeared to be assuming also <<target>> coldness and fixity of that material ; especially her mouth , closed as if it would have required a sculptor 's chisel to open it , and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity .::::the
Meantime , Mr. Brocklehurst , standing on the hearth with his <<target>> behind his back , majestically surveyed the whole school .::::hands
Suddenly his eye gave a blink , as if it had met something that either dazzled or <<target>> its pupil ; turning , he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used --::::shocked
And extending his cane he pointed to the awful <<target>> , his hand shaking as he did so .::::object
`` It is Julia Severn , '' <<target>> Miss Temple , very quietly .::::replied
And why has she , or <<target>> other , curled hair ?::::any
Why , in defiance of every precept and principle of this house , does she conform to the world so <<target>> -- here in an evangelical , charitable establishment -- as to wear her hair one mass of curls ? ''::::openly
`` Julia 's hair curls naturally , '' <<target>> Miss Temple , still more quietly .::::returned
Yes , but we are not to conform to nature ; I wish <<target>> girls to be the children of Grace : and why that abundance ?::::these

Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips , as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them ; she <<target>> the order , however , and when the first class could take in what was required of them , they obeyed .::::gave
Leaning a little back on my bench , I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre : it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them <<target>> ; he would perhaps have felt that , whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter , the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined .::::too
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals <<target>> five minutes , then pronounced sentence .::::some
These words fell like <<target>> knell of doom --::::the

Miss Temple seemed <<target>> remonstrate .::::to
`` Madam , '' he pursued , `` I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety , not <<target>> braided hair and costly apparel ; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven ; these , I repeat , must be cut off ; think of the time wasted , of -- ''::::with
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted : three other <<target>> , ladies , now entered the room .::::visitors
They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on <<target>> , for they were splendidly attired in velvet , silk , and furs .::::dress
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple , as Mrs. and the Misses <<target>> , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .::::brocklehurst
It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative , and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of <<target>> room upstairs , while he transacted business with the housekeeper , questioned the laundress , and lectured the superintendent .::::the
They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith , who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection <<target>> the dormitories : but I had no time to listen to what they said ; other matters called off and enchanted my attention .::::of
To this end , I had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : I might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened <<target>> slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ; I knew it was all over now , and , as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , I rallied my forces for the worst .::::to
`` A careless <<target>> ! ''::::girl
said Mr. Brocklehurst , and immediately after -- '' <<target>> is the new pupil , I perceive . ''::::it
And before I could draw breath , `` I must not <<target>> I have a word to say respecting her . ''::::forget
Then aloud : how loud <<target>> seemed to me !::::it
`` Let the child who broke <<target>> slate come forward ! ''::::her
Of my own accord I could not have stirred ; I was paralysed : but the two great girls who sit on each side of me , set me <<target>> my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge , and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet , and I caught her whispered counsel --::::on
`` Do n't be afraid , Jane , I saw it <<target>> an accident ; you shall not be punished . ''::::was
The kind whisper went to <<target>> heart like a dagger .::::my
`` Another minute , and she will despise me for a hypocrite , '' thought I ; and <<target>> impulse of fury against Reed , Brocklehurst , and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction .::::an
I was no <<target>> Burns .::::helen
`` Fetch that stool , '' said Mr. Brocklehurst , pointing to a very <<target>> one from which a monitor had just risen : it was brought .::::high
`` Place the child <<target>> it . ''::::upon
`` Ladies , '' said he , turning to his family , `` Miss <<target>> , teachers , and children , you all see this girl ? ''::::temple
Of course they did ; for I felt their <<target>> directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin .::::eyes
`` You see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; God has graciously given <<target>> the shape that He has given to all of us ; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character .::::her
Who would think that the Evil One had <<target>> found a servant and agent in her ?::::already
Yet such , I grieve to <<target>> , is the case . ''::::say
A pause -- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves , and to feel that the <<target>> was passed ; and that the trial , no longer to be shirked , must be firmly sustained .::::rubicon
`` My dear children , '' pursued the black marble clergyman , with pathos , `` this is a sad , a melancholy occasion ; for it becomes my duty to warn you , <<target>> this girl , who might be one of God 's own lambs , is a little castaway : not a member of the true flock , but evidently an interloper and an alien .::::that
You must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , <<target>> her company , exclude her from your sports , and shut her out from your converse .::::avoid
Teachers , you must watch her : keep your eyes on her movements , weigh well her words , scrutinise her actions , punish her body to save her soul : if , indeed , such salvation be possible , for ( my tongue <<target>> while I tell it ) this girl , this child , the native of a Christian land , worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut -- this girl is -- a liar ! ''::::falters
`` This I learned from her benefactress ; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state , reared her as her own daughter , and whose kindness , whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad , so dreadful , that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from <<target>> own young ones , fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has sent her here to be healed , even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda ; and , teachers , superintendent , I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her . ''::::her
With this sublime conclusion , Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout , muttered something to his family , <<target>> rose , bowed to Miss Temple , and then all the great people sailed in state from the room .::::who
`` Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool , and let <<target>> one speak to her during the remainder of the day . ''::::no
There was I , then , mounted aloft ; I , who had said I could not bear the shame of standing <<target>> my natural feet in the middle of the room , was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy .::::on
What my sensations were no language can describe ; but just as they all rose , stifling my breath and <<target>> my throat , a girl came up and passed me : in passing , she lifted her eyes .::::constricting
What a strange <<target>> inspired them !::::light
What an extraordinary sensation that <<target>> sent through me !::::ray
How the new feeling <<target>> me up !::::bore
It was as if a martyr , a hero , had passed <<target>> slave or victim , and imparted strength in the transit .::::a
Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith , was chidden for the triviality <<target>> the inquiry , returned to her place , and smiled at me as she again went by .::::of
I remember it now , and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect , of true courage ; it lit <<target>> her marked lineaments , her thin face , her sunken grey eye , like a reflection from the aspect of an angel .::::up
Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm `` the untidy badge ; '' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her <<target>> by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out .::::condemned
Such is the imperfect <<target>> of man !::::nature
such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet ; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd 's <<target>> only see those minute defects , and are blind to the full brightness of the orb .::::can
Ere the half-hour ended , five o'clock struck ; school was <<target>> , and all were gone into the refectory to tea .::::dismissed
I now ventured to descend : it was deep dusk ; <<target>> retired into a corner and sat down on the floor .::::i
Now I wept : Helen Burns was not here ; nothing sustained me ; <<target>> to myself I abandoned myself , and my tears watered the boards .::::left
I had meant to be so good , and to do so much at <<target>> : to make so many friends , to earn respect and win affection .::::lowood
Already I had made visible progress : that very morning I had reached the head of my class ; Miss Miller had praised me warmly ; Miss Temple had smiled approbation ; she had promised to teach me drawing , and to let me learn French , if I continued to <<target>> similar improvement two months longer : and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils ; treated as an equal by those of my own age , and not molested by any ; now , here I lay again crushed and trodden on ; and could I ever rise more ?::::make
`` Never , '' I thought ; <<target>> ardently I wished to die .::::and
While sobbing out this wish in broken accents , some one approached : I started up -- again Helen Burns was near <<target>> ; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long , vacant room ; she brought my coffee and bread .::::me
Helen regarded me , probably with surprise : I could not now abate <<target>> agitation , though I tried hard ; I continued to weep aloud .::::my
She sat down on the ground near me , embraced her knees with her arms , <<target>> rested her head upon them ; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian .::::and
I was the <<target>> who spoke --::::first
`` Helen , why do you stay with a <<target>> whom everybody believes to be a liar ? ''::::girl
Why , there are only eighty people who have heard you <<target>> so , and the world contains hundreds of millions . ''::::called
`` But what have I <<target>> do with millions ?::::to
`` Jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises <<target>> dislikes you : many , I am sure , pity you much . ''::::or
`` How can they pity me after <<target>> Mr. Brocklehurst has said ? ''::::what
`` Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great and admired <<target>> : he is little liked here ; he never took steps to make himself liked .::::man
Had he treated you as an especial favourite , you would have found enemies , declared or covert , <<target>> around you ; as it is , the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared .::::all
Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two , but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts ; <<target>> if you persevere in doing well , these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression .::::and
`` Well , <<target>> ? ''::::helen
said I , putting my hand into hers : she chafed <<target>> fingers gently to warm them , and went on --::::my
`` If all the world hated you , and believed you wicked , while your own conscience <<target>> you , and absolved you from guilt , you would not be without friends . ''::::approved
Look here ; to gain some real affection from you , or Miss Temple , or any other whom I truly love , I would willingly submit to have the bone <<target>> my arm broken , or to let a bull toss me , or to stand behind a kicking horse , and let it dash its hoof at my chest -- ''::::of
you think too much of the love of human beings ; you are too impulsive , too vehement ; the sovereign hand that created your <<target>> , and put life into it , has provided you with other resources than your feeble self , or than creatures feeble as you .::::frame
Besides this earth , and besides the race of men , there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits : that world is round us , for it is everywhere ; and those spirits watch us , for they are commissioned to guard us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame , if scorn smote us on all sides , and hatred crushed us , <<target>> see our tortures , recognise our innocence ( if innocent we be : as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed ; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front ) , and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward .::::angels
Why , then , should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress , when life is so <<target>> over , and death is so certain an entrance to happiness -- to glory ? ''::::soon
I was silent ; Helen had calmed me ; but in <<target>> tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness .::::the
I felt the impression of woe as she spoke , but I could not tell whence it came ; and when , having done speaking , <<target>> breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough , I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her .::::she
Resting my head on Helen 's shoulder , I put my arms round her <<target>> ; she drew me to her , and we reposed in silence .::::waist
Some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in <<target>> a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as Miss Temple .::::through
`` I came on purpose to find you , Jane Eyre , '' said she ; `` I want <<target>> in my room ; and as Helen Burns is with you , she may come too . ''::::you
We went ; following the superintendent 's guidance , we had to thread some intricate passages , and <<target>> a staircase before we reached her apartment ; it contained a good fire , and looked cheerful .::::mount
Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side <<target>> the hearth , and herself taking another , she called me to her side .::::of
`` Is it <<target>> over ? ''::::all
she asked , looking <<target>> at my face .::::down
`` Have you cried <<target>> grief away ? ''::::your
`` I am afraid I <<target>> shall do that . ''::::never
`` We shall think you what you <<target>> yourself to be , my child .::::prove
`` Shall I , <<target>> Temple ? ''::::miss
`` And now tell me who is the <<target>> whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ? ''::::lady
`` Mrs. Reed , <<target>> uncle 's wife .::::my
My uncle is dead , and he <<target>> me to her care . ''::::left
`` Did she not , then , <<target>> you of her own accord ? ''::::adopt
`` No , ma'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle , as I have <<target>> heard the servants say , got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me . ''::::often
`` Well now , Jane , you know , or at least I will tell you , <<target>> when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence .::::that
You have been charged with falsehood ; defend <<target>> to me as well as you can .::::yourself
Say whatever your memory suggests is true ; <<target>> add nothing and exaggerate nothing . ''::::but
I resolved , in the depth of my heart , that I would be most moderate -- most correct ; and , having reflected <<target>> few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say , I told her all the story of my sad childhood .::::a
Exhausted by emotion , my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme ; and mindful of <<target>> 's warnings against the indulgence of resentment , I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary .::::helen
Thus restrained and simplified , it sounded more credible : I <<target>> as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me .::::felt
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit : for I never forgot the , to me , frightful episode of the red-room : in detailing which , my excitement was sure , <<target>> some degree , to break bounds ; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon , and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber .::::in
I had finished : Miss Temple regarded me a <<target>> minutes in silence ; she then said --::::few
Have you coughed <<target>> to-day ? ''::::much
`` Not quite so much , <<target>> think , ma'am . ''::::i
`` And the pain <<target>> your chest ? ''::::in
`` It is a <<target>> better . ''::::little
Miss Temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned <<target>> her own seat : as she resumed it , I heard her sigh low .::::to
She was pensive a few minutes , <<target>> rousing herself , she said cheerfully --::::then
`` Barbara , '' she said to the servant who answered it , `` I have not <<target>> had tea ; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies . ''::::yet
And a tray <<target>> soon brought .::::was
How pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright <<target>> look , placed on the little round table near the fire !::::teapot
of which , however , I , to my dismay ( for I was beginning to <<target>> hungry ) discerned only a very small portion : Miss Temple discerned it too .::::be
`` Barbara , '' said she , `` can <<target>> not bring a little more bread and butter ?::::you
There is not enough <<target>> three . ''::::for
Barbara went out : <<target>> returned soon --::::she
`` Madam , Mrs. Harden says she <<target>> sent up the usual quantity . ''::::has
Mrs. Harden , be it observed , was the housekeeper : a woman after Mr. <<target>> 's own heart , made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron .::::brocklehurst
`` Oh , <<target>> well ! ''::::very
returned Miss Temple ; `` we must make <<target>> do , Barbara , I suppose . ''::::it
And as the girl withdrew she added , smiling , `` Fortunately , <<target>> have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once . ''::::i
`` I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , '' said she , `` but as <<target>> is so little toast , you must have it now , '' and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand .::::there
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia ; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of <<target>> with which our hostess regarded us , as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied .::::gratification
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air , of state in her mien , of refined propriety in her language , which precluded deviation into the ardent , the excited , the eager : something which <<target>> the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her , by a controlling sense of awe ; and such was my feeling now : but as to Helen Burns , I was struck with wonder .::::chastened
They woke , they kindled : first , they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek , which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless ; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her <<target>> , which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple 's -- a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash , nor pencilled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .::::eyes
Then her soul sat on her lips , and language <<target>> , from what source I can not tell .::::flowed
Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough , vigorous enough , <<target>> hold the swelling spring of pure , full , fervid eloquence ?::::to
Such was the characteristic of Helen 's discourse on that , to me , memorable evening ; her spirit <<target>> hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence .::::seemed
What stores of <<target>> they possessed !::::knowledge
Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors : but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father <<target>> taught her , and taking a book from a shelf , bade her read and construe a page of Virgil ; and Helen obeyed , my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line .::::had
She had scarcely finished ere <<target>> bell announced bedtime !::::the
Helen she held a little longer than me : she let her go more reluctantly ; it was Helen her eye followed to the <<target>> ; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh ; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek .::::door
On reaching the bedroom , we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd : she was examining drawers ; she had just pulled out Helen Burns 's , and <<target>> we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand , and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder .::::when
`` My things were indeed in shameful disorder , '' murmured Helen to me , in <<target>> low voice : `` I intended to have arranged them , but I forgot . ''::::a
She wore it till evening , patient , <<target>> , regarding it as a deserved punishment .::::unresentful
The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , I ran to Helen , tore it off , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning <<target>> my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .::::in
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated , Miss Temple , who had written to Mr. <<target>> , received his answer : it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account .::::lloyd
Miss Temple , having assembled the whole school , announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against <<target>> Eyre , and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation .::::jane
The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me , and <<target>> murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions .::::a
I examined , too , in thought , the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story <<target>> Madame Pierrot had that day shown me ; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep .::::which
Well has Solomon said -- '' Better is a dinner of herbs <<target>> love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . ''::::where
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all <<target>> privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries .::::its
But the privations , or rather <<target>> hardships , of Lowood lessened .::::the
Spring drew on : she was indeed already come ; the frosts of <<target>> had ceased ; its snows were melted , its cutting winds ameliorated .::::winter
My wretched feet , flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January , began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April ; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins ; we could now endure the play-hour <<target>> in the garden : sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial , and a greenness grew over those brown beds , which , freshening daily , suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night , and left each morning brighter traces of her steps .::::passed
Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves ; snow-drops , <<target>> , purple auriculas , and golden-eyed pansies .::::crocuses
On Thursday afternoons ( half-holidays ) we now took walks , and <<target>> still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside , under the hedges .::::found
I discovered , too , that a great pleasure , an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded , lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden : this <<target>> consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow , rich in verdure and shadow ; in a bright beck , full of dark stones and sparkling eddies .::::pleasure
How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter , stiffened in frost , shrouded with snow ! -- when mists as chill <<target>> death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks , and rolled down `` ing '' and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck !::::as
That beck itself was then a torrent , turbid and curbless : it tore asunder the wood , and sent a raving sound through the <<target>> , often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet ; and for the forest on its banks , _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons .::::air
April advanced to May : a bright serene May it was ; days of blue <<target>> , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .::::sky
And now vegetation matured with vigour ; Lowood shook loose its tresses ; it became all green , all flowery ; its great elm , ash , and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life ; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its <<target>> ; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows , and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre .::::recesses
All this I enjoyed often and fully , free , unwatched , and almost alone : for this <<target>> liberty and pleasure there was a cause , to which it now becomes my task to advert .::::unwonted
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling , when I speak of it <<target>> bosomed in hill and wood , and rising from the verge of a stream ?::::as
Assuredly , pleasant enough : but whether <<target>> or not is another question .::::healthy
That forest-dell , where Lowood lay , was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence ; which , quickening with the quickening spring , crept into <<target>> Orphan Asylum , breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory , and , ere May arrived , transformed the seminary into an hospital .::::the
The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license ; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise <<target>> keep them in health : and had it been otherwise , no one had leisure to watch or restrain them .::::to
The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who <<target>> fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion .::::were
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood , and death its frequent visitor ; while there was gloom and fear within its walls ; while its rooms and passages steamed with <<target>> smells , the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality , that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors .::::hospital
Its garden , too , glowed with flowers : hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees , lilies had opened , tulips and roses were in bloom ; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies ; the sweetbriars <<target>> out , morning and evening , their scent of spice and apples ; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood , except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin .::::gave
But I , and the rest who continued well , enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season ; they let us ramble in the <<target>> , like gipsies , from morning till night ; we did what we liked , went where we liked : we lived better too .::::wood
Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now : household matters were not scrutinised into ; the cross housekeeper was gone , driven away by the fear <<target>> infection ; her successor , who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary , unused to the ways of her new abode , provided with comparative liberality .::::of
Besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast-basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a <<target>> piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .::::large
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone , rising white and dry from the very middle of the <<target>> , and only to be got at by wading through the water ; a feat I accomplished barefoot .::::beck
The stone was just broad enough to accommodate , comfortably , another girl and me , at that time my chosen comrade -- one Mary Ann Wilson ; a shrewd , <<target>> personage , whose society I took pleasure in , partly because she was witty and original , and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease .::::observant
Some years older than I , she knew more of the world , and could tell me many things I liked to hear : with <<target>> my curiosity found gratification : to my faults also she gave ample indulgence , never imposing curb or rein on anything I said .::::her
She had a turn for narrative , I for analysis ; she liked to inform , I to question ; <<target>> we got on swimmingly together , deriving much entertainment , if not much improvement , from our mutual intercourse .::::so
Why did I not spend these <<target>> days of liberty with her ?::::sweet
or was I so worthless as to <<target>> grown tired of her pure society ?::::have
Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance : she could only tell me amusing stories , and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to <<target>> in ; while , if I have spoken truth of Helen , she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things .::::indulge
True , reader ; and I knew and felt this : and though I am a defective being , with many faults and few redeeming points , yet I never tired <<target>> Helen Burns ; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment , as strong , tender , and respectful as any that ever animated my heart .::::of
How could it be otherwise , when Helen , at all times and under all circumstances , evinced <<target>> me a quiet and faithful friendship , which ill-humour never soured , nor irritation never troubled ?::::for
But Helen was ill at present : for some weeks she had <<target>> removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs .::::been
She was not , I was told , in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients ; for her complaint was consumption , <<target>> typhus : and by consumption I , in my ignorance , understood something mild , which time and care would be sure to alleviate .::::not
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons , and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden ; but , on these occasions , I <<target>> not allowed to go and speak to her ; I only saw her from the schoolroom window , and then not distinctly ; for she was much wrapped up , and sat at a distance under the verandah .::::was
One evening , in the beginning of June , I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood ; we had , as usual , separated ourselves from the others , and had wandered far ; so <<target>> that we lost our way , and had to ask it at a lonely cottage , where a man and woman lived , who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood .::::far
When we got back , it was after moonrise : a pony , which <<target>> knew to be the surgeon 's , was standing at the garden door .::::we
Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill , <<target>> Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening .::::as
She went into the house ; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots <<target>> had dug up in the forest , and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning .::::i
I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might , <<target>> it entered my mind as it had never done before : --::::when
`` How sad to be lying now on a sick <<target>> , and to be in danger of dying !::::bed
This world is pleasant -- it would be dreary to be called <<target>> it , and to have to go who knows where ? ''::::from
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before <<target>> , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood -- the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .::::it
After she had seen him mount his horse and depart , she was <<target>> to close the door , but I ran up to her .::::about
`` How is <<target>> Burns ? ''::::helen
`` Is it her Mr. Bates <<target>> been to see ? ''::::has
`` And what does he <<target>> about her ? ''::::say
`` He says she 'll <<target>> be here long . ''::::not
This phrase , uttered in my hearing yesterday , would have only conveyed the notion <<target>> she was about to be removed to Northumberland , to her own home .::::that
I should not have suspected that it meant she <<target>> dying ; but I knew instantly now !::::was
It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world , and <<target>> she was going to be taken to the region of spirits , if such region there were .::::that
I experienced a shock of horror , then a strong thrill of grief , then a <<target>> -- a necessity to see her ; and I asked in what room she lay .::::desire
`` She is in Miss Temple 's <<target>> , '' said the nurse .::::room
`` May I go up <<target>> speak to her ? ''::::and
It is not likely ; and now it is time for you to come in ; <<target>> 'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling . ''::::you
The nurse closed the front door ; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom : I <<target>> just in time ; it was nine o'clock , and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed .::::was
It might be two hours later , probably near eleven , when I -- not having been able to fall asleep , and deeming , from the perfect silence of the dormitory , that my companions were <<target>> wrapt in profound repose -- rose softly , put on my frock over my night-dress , and , without shoes , crept from the apartment , and set off in quest of Miss Temple 's room .::::all
It was quite at the other end of the house ; but I knew my way ; and the light of <<target>> unclouded summer moon , entering here and there at passage windows , enabled me to find it without difficulty .::::the
An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room : and <<target>> passed its door quickly , fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me .::::i
I dreaded being discovered and sent back ; for I _must_ see Helen , -- I must embrace her <<target>> she died , -- I must give her one last kiss , exchange with her one last word .::::before
Having descended a staircase , traversed a portion of the house below , and succeeded in opening and shutting , without noise , two <<target>> , I reached another flight of steps ; these I mounted , and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple 's room .::::doors
A light shone through the keyhole and from under <<target>> door ; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity .::::the
Coming near , I found the door slightly ajar ; probably <<target>> admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness .::::to
Indisposed to hesitate , and full of impatient impulses -- soul and senses <<target>> with keen throes -- I put it back and looked in .::::quivering
My eye sought Helen , <<target>> feared to find death .::::and
Close by Miss Temple 's bed , and half covered <<target>> its white curtains , there stood a little crib .::::with
I saw the outline of a form under the clothes , but the face was hid by the hangings : the nurse <<target>> had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep ; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table .::::i

I advanced ; then paused by the crib side : my hand was <<target>> the curtain , but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it .::::on
I still recoiled at the <<target>> of seeing a corpse .::::dread
I whispered softly , `` <<target>> you awake ? ''::::are
She stirred herself , put back the curtain , and I saw her face , pale , <<target>> , but quite composed : she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated .::::wasted
`` Can it be <<target>> , Jane ? ''::::you
she asked , in <<target>> own gentle voice .::::her
I got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was cold , and her cheek both <<target>> and thin , and so were her hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old .::::cold
`` Why are you <<target>> here , Jane ?::::come
It is past eleven o'clock : I <<target>> it strike some minutes since . ''::::heard
`` I came to see you , Helen : I heard you were very <<target>> , and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you . ''::::ill

`` Yes ; to my long <<target>> -- my last home . ''::::home
`` Jane , your little feet are bare ; <<target>> down and cover yourself with my quilt . ''::::lie
I did so : she put her arm over <<target>> , and I nestled close to her .::::me
After a long silence , <<target>> resumed , still whispering --::::she
We all must die one day , and the illness which is removing me is <<target>> painful ; it is gentle and gradual : my mind is at rest .::::not
I leave no one to regret me much : I have only a <<target>> ; and he is lately married , and will not miss me .::::father

`` You are sure , then , Helen , that there is such a place <<target>> heaven , and that our souls can get to it when we die ? ''::::as

`` You will come to the same region of happiness : be received by <<target>> same mighty , universal Parent , no doubt , dear Jane . ''::::the
Again I questioned , but <<target>> time only in thought .::::this
`` Where is <<target>> region ?::::that
And I clasped my arms closer round Helen ; she seemed dearer to me than ever ; I felt <<target>> if I could not let her go ; I lay with my face hidden on her neck .::::as
Presently she said , <<target>> the sweetest tone --::::in
`` How comfortable <<target>> am !::::i
`` Good-night , <<target>> . ''::::jane
`` Good-night , <<target>> . ''::::helen
When I awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ; I looked up ; I was in <<target>> 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory .::::somebody
I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards I learned <<target>> Miss Temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against Helen Burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .::::that
I was asleep , and <<target>> was -- dead .::::helen
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; <<target>> now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word `` Resurgam . ''::::but
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence : to <<target>> first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters .::::the
But this is not to <<target>> a regular autobiography .::::be
I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest ; therefore I now pass <<target>> space of eight years almost in silence : a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection .::::a
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood , it gradually disappeared from thence ; <<target>> not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school .::::but
Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge , and by degrees <<target>> facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree .::::various
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation ; new <<target>> were made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee .::::regulations
Mr. Brocklehurst , who , from his wealth and family connections , could not be overlooked , still retained the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen <<target>> rather more enlarged and sympathising minds : his office of inspector , too , was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness , comfort with economy , compassion with uprightness .::::of
The school , thus improved , became in <<target>> a truly useful and noble institution .::::time
During these eight years my life was uniform : <<target>> not unhappy , because it was not inactive .::::but
I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , <<target>> with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , urged me on : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .::::together
In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class ; then I was invested with the office <<target>> teacher ; which I discharged with zeal for two years : but at the end of that time I altered .::::of
Miss Temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements ; <<target>> friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion .::::her
At this period she married , removed with her husband ( a clergyman , an excellent man , <<target>> worthy of such a wife ) to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me .::::almost
From the day she left I was no longer the same : with her was gone every <<target>> feeling , every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me .::::settled
I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more <<target>> thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind .::::harmonious
I had given in allegiance to duty and order ; I was quiet ; I believed I was content : <<target>> the eyes of others , usually even to my own , I appeared a disciplined and subdued character .::::to
But destiny , in the <<target>> of the Rev .::::shape
Mr. Nasmyth , came between me and Miss Temple : I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise , shortly after the marriage ceremony ; I watched the chaise mount <<target>> hill and disappear beyond its brow ; and then retired to my own room , and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion .::::the
I walked about the chamber <<target>> of the time .::::most
I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval I had undergone a <<target>> process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple -- or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity -- and that now I was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions .::::transforming
It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn , but rather as if a motive were gone : it <<target>> not the power to be tranquil which had failed me , but the reason for tranquillity was no more .::::was
My world had for some years been in Lowood : my experience had been of its rules and systems ; now I remembered that the real world was wide , and that a <<target>> field of hopes and fears , of sensations and excitements , awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse , to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils .::::varied
I went to my window , <<target>> it , and looked out .::::opened
My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote , the blue peaks ; it was <<target>> I longed to surmount ; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground , exile limits .::::those
I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and <<target>> in a gorge between two ; how I longed to follow it farther !::::vanishing
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach ; I remembered descending that hill at twilight ; <<target>> age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood , and I had never quitted it since .::::an
My vacations had all been spent at school : Mrs. Reed had never sent for me <<target>> Gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me .::::to
And now I felt that it was not enough ; I <<target>> of the routine of eight years in one afternoon .::::tired
I desired liberty ; for liberty I gasped ; for liberty I uttered <<target>> prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing .::::a
I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication ; for change , stimulus : that petition , too , seemed swept off into <<target>> space : `` Then , '' I cried , half desperate , `` grant me at least a new servitude ! ''::::vague
Here a bell , ringing the hour <<target>> supper , called me downstairs .::::of
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied the same <<target>> with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur , by a prolonged effusion of small talk .::::room
How I wished sleep <<target>> silence her .::::would
It seemed as if , could I but go back to the idea which had last entered <<target>> mind as I stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief .::::my
Miss Gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy Welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other <<target>> than as a nuisance ; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; I was debarrassed of interruption ; my half-effaced thought instantly revived .::::light
There is something in that , '' I soliloquised ( mentally , be it understood ; I did not talk aloud ) , `` I know there is , because it does not sound too sweet ; it is <<target>> like such words as Liberty , Excitement , Enjoyment : delightful sounds truly ; but no more than sounds for me ; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them .::::not
That must be <<target>> of fact .::::matter
Any one may serve : I have served here eight <<target>> ; now all I want is to serve elsewhere .::::years
Can I not get so <<target>> of my own will ?::::much
Is not the <<target>> feasible ?::::thing
Yes -- yes -- the end is not so difficult ; if I had <<target>> a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it . ''::::only
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; <<target>> covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then I proceeded _to think_ again with all my might .::::i
`` What do <<target>> want ?::::i
A new place , in a new house , amongst new faces , under new <<target>> : I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better .::::circumstances
How do people do to <<target>> a new place ?::::get
They apply to friends , I <<target>> : I have no friends .::::suppose
There are many others who have no friends , who must look about for <<target>> and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ? ''::::themselves
I could not tell : nothing answered me ; I then <<target>> my brain to find a response , and quickly .::::ordered
It worked and worked faster : I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; <<target>> for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts .::::but
Feverish with vain labour , I got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the <<target>> , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .::::curtain
A kind fairy , in my absence , had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow ; for as I lay down , it <<target>> quietly and naturally to my mind. -- '' Those who want situations advertise ; you must advertise in the _ -- -shire Herald_ . ''::::came
I know nothing <<target>> advertising . ''::::about
Replies rose smooth and <<target>> now : --::::prompt
`` You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_ ; you must put it , the first opportunity you have , into the post at <<target>> ; answers must be addressed to J.E. , at the post-office there ; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter , if any are come , and act accordingly . ''::::lowton
This scheme I went over twice , thrice ; it was then digested in my mind ; <<target>> had it in a clear practical form : I felt satisfied , and fell asleep .::::i
With earliest day , I was up : I had my advertisement written , enclosed , <<target>> directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus : --::::and
`` A young lady accustomed to tuition '' ( <<target>> I not been a teacher two years ? )::::had
`` is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen ( I thought that <<target>> I was barely eighteen , it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age ) .::::as
`` Address , J.E. , Post-office , <<target>> , -- - shire . ''::::lowton
This document remained locked in my drawer all day : after tea , I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton , <<target>> order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers ; permission was readily granted ; I went .::::in
It was a walk of two miles , and the evening was wet , but the days were still long ; I visited a shop or <<target>> , slipped the letter into the post-office , and came back through heavy rain , with streaming garments , but with a relieved heart .::::two
The succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end at last , however , like all sublunary things , and <<target>> more , towards the close of a pleasant autumn day , I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton .::::once
A picturesque track it was , by the way ; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale : but that day I thought <<target>> of the letters , that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound , than of the charms of lea and water .::::more
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes ; so I discharged that business first , and when it was done , I stepped across the clean <<target>> quiet little street from the shoemaker 's to the post-office : it was kept by an old dame , who wore horn spectacles on her nose , and black mittens on her hands .::::and
`` Are there any <<target>> for J.E. ? ''::::letters
She peered at me over her spectacles , and then she opened a drawer and fumbled <<target>> its contents for a long time , so long that my hopes began to falter .::::among
At last , having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes , she presented it <<target>> the counter , accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance -- it was for J.E .::::across
`` Is there <<target>> one ? ''::::only
`` There are no more , '' said she ; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward : <<target>> could not open it then ; rules obliged me to be back by eight , and it was already half-past seven .::::i
Various duties awaited me <<target>> my arrival .::::on
I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study ; then it was my turn <<target>> read prayers ; to see them to bed : afterwards I supped with the other teachers .::::to
Even when we finally retired for the night , the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion : we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick , and I dreaded lest <<target>> should talk till it was all burnt out ; fortunately , however , the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect : she was already snoring before I had finished undressing .::::she
There still remained an inch of candle : I now took out my letter ; <<target>> seal was an initial F. ; I broke it ; the contents were brief .::::the
`` If J.E. , who advertised in the _ -- -shire Herald_ of last Thursday , possesses the acquirements mentioned , and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character <<target>> competency , a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil , a little girl , under ten years of age ; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum .::::and
`` Mrs. Fairfax , Thornfield , <<target>> Millcote , -- -shire . ''::::near
I examined the document long : the writing was old-fashioned <<target>> rather uncertain , like that of an elderly lady .::::and
This circumstance was satisfactory : a private fear had haunted me , that in thus acting for myself , and by my own guidance , I ran the <<target>> of getting into some scrape ; and , above all things , I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable , proper , _en regle_ .::::risk
I now felt that an elderly lady was no <<target>> ingredient in the business I had on hand .::::bad

Next day new steps were to be taken ; my plans could no longer be confined <<target>> my own breast ; I must impart them in order to achieve their success .::::to
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation , I told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received ( for at Lowood <<target>> only got 15 pounds per annum ) ; and requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst , or some of the committee , and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references .::::i
She obligingly consented to act <<target>> mediatrix in the matter .::::as
A note was accordingly addressed to that lady , who returned for answer , that `` I <<target>> do as I pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . ''::::might

The box was corded , <<target>> card nailed on .::::the
In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton , whither <<target>> myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach .::::i
I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress , prepared my bonnet , gloves , and muff ; sought in all my drawers to <<target>> that no article was left behind ; and now having nothing more to do , I sat down and tried to rest .::::see
I could not ; though I had been on foot all day , <<target>> could not now repose an instant ; I was too much excited .::::i
A phase of my life was closing to-night , a new one opening to-morrow : impossible <<target>> slumber in the interval ; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished .::::to
`` Miss , '' said a servant who met me in the lobby , where I <<target>> wandering like a troubled spirit , `` a person below wishes to see you . ''::::was
`` The carrier , no doubt , '' <<target>> thought , and ran downstairs without inquiry .::::i
I was passing the back-parlour or teachers ' sitting-room , the door of which was <<target>> open , to go to the kitchen , when some one ran out --::::half
cried the individual who stopped my <<target>> and took my hand .::::progress
I looked : I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant , matronly , yet <<target>> young ; very good-looking , with black hair and eyes , and lively complexion .::::still
`` Well , who <<target>> it ? ''::::is
In another second I was embracing and <<target>> her rapturously : `` Bessie !::::kissing

`` Yes ; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven , the coachman ; and <<target>> 've a little girl besides Bobby there , that I 've christened Jane . ''::::i

but Bobby preferred sidling <<target>> to his mother .::::over

`` Georgiana is handsome , <<target>> suppose , Bessie ? ''::::i
She went up to London last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were <<target>> the match ; and -- what do you think ? -- he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away ; but they were found out and stopped .::::against

`` No , indeed : but I have long wanted to see you , and when I heard that there had been a letter from you , and that you were <<target>> to another part of the country , I thought I 'd just set off , and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach . ''::::going
`` I am afraid you are <<target>> in me , Bessie . ''::::disappointed
I said this laughing : I perceived that Bessie 's glance , <<target>> it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .::::though
`` No , Miss Jane , not exactly : you are genteel enough ; you look like a lady , <<target>> it is as much as ever I expected of you : you were no beauty as a child . ''::::and
I smiled at Bessie 's frank answer : I felt that it was correct , but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import : <<target>> eighteen most people wish to please , and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification .::::at
`` What can <<target>> do ?::::you
Can you play on <<target>> piano ? ''::::the

`` Very likely , '' I returned ; `` <<target>> perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant . ''::::or
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer , and then she was obliged to leave me : I <<target>> her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton , while I was waiting for the coach .::::saw
We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there : each went her separate way ; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance <<target>> was to take her back to Gateshead , I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote .::::which
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play ; and when I draw up the curtain this time , reader , you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote , with such large figured papering on <<target>> walls as inn rooms have ; such a carpet , such furniture , such ornaments on the mantelpiece , such prints , including a portrait of George the Third , and another of the Prince of Wales , and a representation of the death of Wolfe .::::the
All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling , and by that of an excellent fire , near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet ; my muff and umbrella lie on the <<target>> , and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours ' exposure to the rawness of an October day : I left Lowton at four o'clock a.m. , and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight .::::table
Reader , though I look comfortably accommodated , <<target>> am not very tranquil in my mind .::::i
I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me ; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the `` <<target>> '' placed for my convenience , expecting to hear my name pronounced , and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield .::::boots
Nothing of the sort was visible ; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre , I was answered in the negative : so <<target>> had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room : and here I am waiting , while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts .::::i
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world , cut adrift from every connection , uncertain <<target>> the port to which it is bound can be reached , and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted .::::whether
The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation , the glow of pride warms it ; but then the throb <<target>> fear disturbs it ; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone .::::of
I bethought myself to <<target>> the bell .::::ring
`` Is there a place in <<target>> neighbourhood called Thornfield ? ''::::this
I asked of the waiter <<target>> answered the summons .::::who
I do n't know , ma'am ; <<target>> 'll inquire at the bar . ''::::i
He vanished , <<target>> reappeared instantly --::::but
`` Is your name <<target>> , Miss ? ''::::eyre
`` Person here waiting <<target>> you . ''::::for
I jumped up , took my muff and umbrella , and hastened into the inn-passage : a man <<target>> standing by the open door , and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance .::::was
`` This will be your <<target>> , I suppose ? ''::::luggage
He hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then I <<target>> in ; before he shut me up , I asked him how far it was to Thornfield .::::got
`` A matter of <<target>> miles . ''::::six
`` How long shall we be <<target>> we get there ? ''::::before
`` Happen an hour <<target>> a half . ''::::and
He fastened the car door , climbed to his <<target>> seat outside , and we set off .::::own
Our progress was leisurely , and gave me ample time to reflect ; I was content to be at length so near the end <<target>> my journey ; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance , I meditated much at my ease .::::of
`` I suppose , '' thought I , `` judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , Mrs. Fairfax is not a very <<target>> person : so much the better ; I never lived amongst fine people but once , and I was very miserable with them .::::dashing
I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl ; if so , and if she is in any degree amiable , I shall surely be <<target>> to get on with her ; I will do my best ; it is a pity that doing one 's best does not always answer .::::able
At Lowood , indeed , I took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in <<target>> ; but with Mrs. Reed , I remember my best was always spurned with scorn .::::pleasing
I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed ; <<target>> if she does , I am not bound to stay with her !::::but
let the worst come to the <<target>> , I can advertise again .::::worst
How far are we on our <<target>> now , I wonder ? ''::::road
I let down the window and looked out ; Millcote was behind us ; judging by the <<target>> of its lights , it seemed a place of considerable magnitude , much larger than Lowton .::::number
We were now , as far as I could see , on a sort of common ; but there were houses scattered all over the <<target>> ; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood , more populous , less picturesque ; more stirring , less romantic .::::district
The roads were heavy , the night misty ; my conductor let his horse walk all the way , and the hour <<target>> a half extended , I verily believe , to two hours ; at last he turned in his seat and said --::::and
`` You 're noan so far <<target>> ' Thornfield now . ''::::fro
Again I looked out : we were passing a church ; I saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell <<target>> tolling a quarter ; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .::::was
About ten minutes after , the driver got down and opened a pair <<target>> gates : we passed through , and they clashed to behind us .::::of
We now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a <<target>> : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window ; all the rest were dark .::::house
The car stopped at the front door ; it was <<target>> by a maid-servant ; I alighted and went in .::::opened
`` Will you walk this <<target>> , ma'am ? ''::::way
said the girl ; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round : she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me , <<target>> as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured ; when I could see , however , a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view .::::contrasting
A snug small room ; a round table by a cheerful fire ; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned , wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady , <<target>> widow 's cap , black silk gown , and snowy muslin apron ; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax , only less stately and milder looking .::::in
A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived ; there was no grandeur to overwhelm , no stateliness to <<target>> ; and then , as I entered , the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me .::::embarrass
`` How do you <<target>> , my dear ?::::do
I am afraid you have had a tedious ride ; John drives so <<target>> ; you must be cold , come to the fire . ''::::slowly
`` Mrs. Fairfax , <<target>> suppose ? ''::::i
She conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl <<target>> untie my bonnet-strings ; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble .::::and
`` Oh , it is no trouble ; I dare <<target>> your own hands are almost numbed with cold .::::say
Leah , make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich <<target>> two : here are the keys of the storeroom . ''::::or
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch <<target>> keys , and delivered them to the servant .::::of
`` Now , then , draw nearer <<target>> the fire , '' she continued .::::to
`` She treats me like a <<target>> , '' thought I .::::visitor
`` I little expected such a reception ; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness : this is not like <<target>> I have heard of the treatment of governesses ; but I must not exult too soon . ''::::what
`` Shall I have the pleasure <<target>> seeing Miss Fairfax to-night ? ''::::of
I asked , when I had <<target>> of what she offered me .::::partaken
`` What did you <<target>> , my dear ?::::say
I am a little deaf , '' returned the <<target>> lady , approaching her ear to my mouth .::::good
I repeated the <<target>> more distinctly .::::question
Oh , you <<target>> Miss Varens !::::mean
Varens is the name of <<target>> future pupil . ''::::your
Then she is not <<target>> daughter ? ''::::your
`` No , -- I <<target>> no family . ''::::have
I should have followed up my first inquiry , by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her ; but <<target>> recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions : besides , I was sure to hear in time .::::i
`` I am so glad , '' she continued , as she sat down opposite to me , and took the cat on <<target>> knee ; `` I am so glad you are come ; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion .::::her
I say alone -- Leah is a nice girl to be sure , and John and his wife are very decent people ; but then you see they are only <<target>> , and one ca n't converse with them on terms of equality : one must keep them at due distance , for fear of losing one 's authority .::::servants
I 'm sure last winter ( it was a very severe one , if you recollect , and when it did not snow , it rained and blew ) , not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house , from <<target>> till February ; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone ; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes ; but I do n't think the poor girl liked the task much : she felt it confining .::::november
In spring and summer one got on better : sunshine and long days make such a difference ; and then , just at the commencement of this autumn , <<target>> Adela Varens came and her nurse : a child makes a house alive all at once ; and now you are here I shall be quite gay . ''::::little
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk ; and I drew my chair a little <<target>> to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .::::nearer
`` But I 'll not keep you sitting up late to-night , '' said she ; `` it is <<target>> the stroke of twelve now , and you have been travelling all day : you must feel tired .::::on
I 've had the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small apartment , but I thought you would like it better than one <<target>> the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer furniture , but they are so dreary and solitary , I never sleep in them myself . ''::::of
I thanked her for her considerate choice , and as I really <<target>> fatigued with my long journey , expressed my readiness to retire .::::felt
She took her candle , and <<target>> followed her from the room .::::i
First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened ; having <<target>> the key from the lock , she led the way upstairs .::::taken
The steps and banisters were of oak ; the staircase window was high and latticed ; both it and the <<target>> gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house .::::long
A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery , suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude ; and I was <<target>> , when finally ushered into my chamber , to find it of small dimensions , and furnished in ordinary , modern style .::::glad
The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart , and I knelt down at the bedside , and offered up thanks where thanks were due ; not forgetting , ere <<target>> rose , to implore aid on my further path , and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned .::::i
My couch had no thorns in it that <<target>> ; my solitary room no fears .::::night
At once weary and content , I slept soon and <<target>> : when I awoke it was broad day .::::soundly
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains , showing papered <<target>> and a carpeted floor , so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood , that my spirits rose at the view .::::walls
Externals have a great effect on the young : I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for <<target>> , one that was to have its flowers and pleasures , as well as its thorns and toils .::::me
My faculties , roused by the change of scene , <<target>> new field offered to hope , seemed all astir .::::the
I can not precisely define what they expected , but it was something pleasant : <<target>> perhaps that day or that month , but at an indefinite future period .::::not
I rose ; I dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain -- for I had no article <<target>> attire that was not made with extreme simplicity -- I was still by nature solicitous to be neat .::::of
It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made : on the contrary , I <<target>> wished to look as well as I could , and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit .::::ever
And why had I these <<target>> and these regrets ?::::aspirations
It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to <<target>> ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .::::myself
Having opened my chamber window , and seen that I left all <<target>> straight and neat on the toilet table , I ventured forth .::::things
Traversing the long and matted gallery , I descended the slippery steps of oak ; then I gained the hall : I halted there a minute ; I looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , I remember , represented a grim man <<target>> a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .::::in
Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me ; <<target>> then I was so little accustomed to grandeur .::::but
The hall-door , which was half of glass , <<target>> open ; I stepped over the threshold .::::stood
It was a fine autumn morning ; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green <<target>> ; advancing on to the lawn , I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion .::::fields
Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery , whose cawing tenants were now on the wing : they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow , from which <<target>> were separated by a sunk fence , and where an array of mighty old thorn trees , strong , knotty , and broad as oaks , at once explained the etymology of the mansion 's designation .::::these
Farther off were hills : not so lofty as those round Lowood , nor so craggy , nor so like barriers of separation from the living world ; but <<target>> quiet and lonely hills enough , and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote .::::yet
A little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; <<target>> church of the district stood nearer Thornfield : its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .::::the
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air , yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks , yet surveying the wide , hoary front <<target>> the hall , and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit , when that lady appeared at the door .::::of
`` I see you are <<target>> early riser . ''::::an
I went up to her , and was received <<target>> an affable kiss and shake of the hand .::::with
`` How do you <<target>> Thornfield ? ''::::like
`` Yes , '' she said , `` it is a pretty place ; but I fear it will be getting out of order , unless Mr. Rochester should take it into <<target>> head to come and reside here permanently ; or , at least , visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor . ''::::his
`` Who is <<target>> ? ''::::he
`` Did you not know <<target>> was called Rochester ? ''::::he
Of course I did not -- I had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed <<target>> regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .::::to
I am only the <<target>> -- the manager .::::housekeeper
To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he <<target>> a clergyman , incumbent of Hay -- that little village yonder on the hill -- and that church near the gates was his .::::was
The present Mr. Rochester 's mother was a Fairfax , and second cousin to my husband : but I never presume on the connection -- in fact , it <<target>> nothing to me ; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper : my employer is always civil , and I expect nothing more . ''::::is
`` She is Mr. Rochester 's ward ; he <<target>> me to find a governess for her .::::commissioned
He intended to have her brought up <<target>> -- -shire , I believe .::::in
The enigma then was explained : this affable and kind little <<target>> was no great dame ; but a dependant like myself .::::widow
I did not like her the worse for that ; <<target>> the contrary , I felt better pleased than ever .::::on
The equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension <<target>> her part : so much the better -- my position was all the freer .::::on
I looked at my pupil , who did not at first appear to notice me : she was quite a child , perhaps seven or <<target>> years old , slightly built , with a pale , small-featured face , and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist .::::eight
`` C'est la <<target>> gouverante ! ''::::ma
said she , pointing to me , <<target>> addressing her nurse ; who answered --::::and
`` Are they <<target>> ? ''::::foreigners
I inquired , amazed at <<target>> the French language .::::hearing
When she first came here she could speak no English ; now she can make shift to talk it a little : I do n't <<target>> her , she mixes it so with French ; but you will make out her meaning very well , I dare say . ''::::understand
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady ; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could , and had besides , during the last seven years , learnt a portion of French by heart <<target>> -- applying myself to take pains with my accent , and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher , I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language , and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela .::::daily
She will be glad : nobody here understands <<target>> : Madame Fairfax is all English .::::her
Sophie is my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked -- <<target>> it did smoke ! -- and I was sick , and so was Sophie , and so was Mr. Rochester .::::how
Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the <<target>> , and Sophie and I had little beds in another place .::::salon
And Mademoiselle -- what <<target>> your name ? ''::::is
`` Eyre -- <<target>> Eyre . ''::::jane
I can not <<target>> it .::::say
We stayed there nearly a week : I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the <<target>> ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that I fed with crumbs . ''::::park
`` Can you understand her when <<target>> runs on so fast ? ''::::she
I understood her very well , for I had <<target>> accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot .::::been
`` I wish , '' continued the good lady , `` you would ask her <<target>> question or two about her parents : I wonder if she remembers them ? ''::::a
`` Adele , '' I inquired , `` with whom did you live <<target>> you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ? ''::::when
`` I lived long ago with mama ; <<target>> she is gone to the Holy Virgin .::::but
Mama used to teach me to dance <<target>> sing , and to say verses .::::and
A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama , and I used to dance before <<target>> , or to sit on their knees and sing to them : I liked it .::::them
Shall I let you hear <<target>> sing now ? ''::::me
She had finished her breakfast , so I permitted <<target>> to give a specimen of her accomplishments .::::her
Descending from her chair , she came and placed herself on my knee ; then , folding her little hands demurely before <<target>> , shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling , she commenced singing a song from some opera .::::her
It was the strain of a forsaken lady , who , after bewailing the perfidy of her lover , calls pride to her aid ; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and <<target>> robes , and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball , and prove to him , by the gaiety of her demeanour , how little his desertion has affected her .::::richest
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of <<target>> and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least I thought so .::::love
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough , <<target>> with the _naivete_ of her age .::::and
This achieved , she jumped from my knee and said , `` <<target>> , Mademoiselle , I will repeat you some poetry . ''::::now
Assuming an attitude , she began , `` La <<target>> des Rats : fable de La Fontaine . ''::::ligue
She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis , a flexibility of voice and an <<target>> of gesture , very unusual indeed at her age , and which proved she had been carefully trained .::::appropriateness
`` Was it your mama who <<target>> you that piece ? ''::::taught
`` Yes , and she just used to say it <<target>> this way : 'Qu ' avez vous donc ?::::in
lui dit un de ces <<target>> ; parlez ! '::::rats
She made me lift my hand -- so -- to <<target>> me to raise my voice at the question .::::remind
Now shall I dance <<target>> you ? ''::::for
`` No , that will do : but after your mama went to the <<target>> Virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ? ''::::holy
`` With Madame Frederic and her husband : she took care <<target>> me , but she is nothing related to me .::::of
I think she is poor , for she <<target>> not so fine a house as mama .::::had
I was not <<target>> there .::::long
Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and <<target>> me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him . ''::::gave
After breakfast , Adele and I withdrew to the library , which room , <<target>> appears , Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom .::::it
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works , and several volumes of light literature , poetry , biography , travels , a few romances , & c. I suppose he had <<target>> that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal ; and , indeed , they contented me amply for the present ; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood , they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information .::::considered
In this room , too , there was a cabinet piano , quite new and <<target>> superior tone ; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes .::::of
I found my pupil sufficiently docile , though disinclined to apply : <<target>> had not been used to regular occupation of any kind .::::she
I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first ; so , when I had talked to her a great deal , <<target>> got her to learn a little , and when the morning had advanced to noon , I allowed her to return to her nurse .::::and
I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time <<target>> drawing some little sketches for her use .::::in
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils , Mrs. Fairfax called to <<target>> : `` Your morning school-hours are over now , I suppose , '' said she .::::me
She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood <<target>> : I went in when she addressed me .::::open
Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine <<target>> spar , which stood on a sideboard .::::purple
`` What a <<target>> room ! ''::::beautiful
I exclaimed , as I looked round ; for <<target>> had never before seen any half so imposing .::::i
`` Yes ; this <<target>> the dining-room .::::is
I have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything <<target>> so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault . ''::::gets
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window , and <<target>> like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain , now looped up .::::hung
Mounting to it by two broad steps , and looking through , I thought I caught <<target>> glimpse of a fairy place , so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond .::::a
Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room , and within it a boudoir , both spread with white carpets , on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers ; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves , beneath <<target>> glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans ; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass , ruby red ; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire .::::which
`` In what order you <<target>> these rooms , Mrs .::::keep
`` No dust , no canvas coverings : except that the air <<target>> chilly , one would think they were inhabited daily . ''::::feels
`` Why , Miss Eyre , though Mr. Rochester 's visits here are rare , they are always sudden and unexpected ; and as I observed that it put him <<target>> to find everything swathed up , and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival , I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness . ''::::out
`` Do you <<target>> him ?::::like
Is he generally <<target>> ? ''::::liked
`` Oh , yes ; the <<target>> have always been respected here .::::family
Almost all the land in this neighbourhood , as far as you can <<target>> , has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind . ''::::see
`` Well , but , leaving his land out <<target>> the question , do you like him ?::::of
Is he liked <<target>> himself ? ''::::for
`` I have no cause to do otherwise than like him ; and I believe he is considered <<target>> just and liberal landlord by his tenants : but he has never lived much amongst them . ''::::a
`` But has <<target>> no peculiarities ?::::he
What , in short , <<target>> his character ? ''::::is
I dare say he is clever , but <<target>> never had much conversation with him . ''::::i
`` In what way <<target>> he peculiar ? ''::::is
`` I do n't know -- it is not easy to describe -- nothing striking , but you feel it when he speaks to you ; you can not be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest , <<target>> he is pleased or the contrary ; you do n't thoroughly understand him , in short -- at least , I do n't : but it is of no consequence , he is a very good master . ''::::whether
There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character , or observing and describing salient points , either in <<target>> or things : the good lady evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puzzled , but did not draw her out .::::persons
Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes ; a gentleman , a landed proprietor -- nothing more : she inquired <<target>> searched no further , and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity .::::and
When we left the dining-room , she proposed to show me over the rest of the house ; and <<target>> followed her upstairs and downstairs , admiring as I went ; for all was well arranged and handsome .::::i
The large front chambers I thought especially grand : and some of the third-storey <<target>> , though dark and low , were interesting from their air of antiquity .::::rooms
The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here , as fashions changed : and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old ; chests in oak or walnut , looking , with their strange carvings of <<target>> branches and cherubs ' heads , like types of the Hebrew ark ; rows of venerable chairs , high-backed and narrow ; stools still more antiquated , on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries , wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust .::::palm
All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the <<target>> of a home of the past : a shrine of memory .::::aspect
`` Do the servants sleep <<target>> these rooms ? ''::::in
`` No ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back ; no one ever sleeps here : one <<target>> almost say that , if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall , this would be its haunt . ''::::would
`` So I think : you <<target>> no ghost , then ? ''::::have
`` Nor any <<target>> of one ?::::traditions
no legends or <<target>> stories ? ''::::ghost
And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their <<target>> : perhaps , though , that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now . ''::::time
`` Yes -- 'after life 's fitful fever <<target>> sleep well , ' '' I muttered .::::they
`` Where are you <<target>> now , Mrs .::::going
for she was <<target>> away .::::moving
`` On to the leads ; will you <<target>> and see the view from thence ? ''::::come
I followed still , up a very narrow staircase to the attics , and <<target>> by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall .::::thence
I was now on a level with the crow <<target>> , and could see into their nests .::::colony
Leaning over the battlements and looking far down , I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map : the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion ; the field , wide as a park , dotted with its ancient timber ; the wood , dun and sere , <<target>> by a path visibly overgrown , greener with moss than the trees were with foliage ; the church at the gates , the road , the tranquil hills , all reposing in the autumn day 's sun ; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky , azure , marbled with pearly white .::::divided
No feature in the scene was <<target>> , but all was pleasing .::::extraordinary
When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door , I could scarcely see my way down the ladder ; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I <<target>> been looking up , and to that sunlit scene of grove , pasture , and green hill , of which the hall was the centre , and over which I had been gazing with delight .::::had
I lingered in the long passage to which this led , separating the front and back rooms of the third storey : narrow , low , and dim , with only <<target>> little window at the far end , and looking , with its two rows of small black doors all shut , like a corridor in some Bluebeard 's castle .::::one
While I paced softly on , the last sound I expected to hear <<target>> so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear .::::in
It was a curious laugh ; <<target>> , formal , mirthless .::::distinct
It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber ; though <<target>> originated but in one , and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued .::::it
I called out : for I now <<target>> her descending the great stairs .::::heard
`` Did you hear <<target>> loud laugh ?::::that
`` Did you <<target>> it ? ''::::hear
Sometimes Leah is with her ; <<target>> are frequently noisy together . ''::::they
The laugh was repeated in its low , syllabic <<target>> , and terminated in an odd murmur .::::tone
I really did not expect any Grace to answer ; for the laugh was as tragic , as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard ; and , but that <<target>> was high noon , and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation ; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear , I should have been superstitiously afraid .::::it
However , the event showed me I was a <<target>> for entertaining a sense even of surprise .::::fool
Grace curtseyed silently <<target>> went in .::::and
By-the-bye , how have you got on <<target>> your new pupil this morning ? ''::::with
The conversation , thus turned on Adele , continued <<target>> we reached the light and cheerful region below .::::till
Adele came running to meet us <<target>> the hall , exclaiming --::::in
`` Mesdames , vous <<target>> servies ! ''::::etes
adding , `` J'ai bien <<target>> , moi ! ''::::faim
We found dinner ready , and waiting <<target>> us in Mrs. Fairfax 's room .::::for
For several subsequent days I <<target>> little of Mr. Rochester .::::saw
In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business , and , in the afternoon , <<target>> from Millcote or the neighbourhood called , and sometimes stayed to dine with him .::::gentlemen
During this interval , even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence , and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall , on the stairs , or <<target>> the gallery , when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly , just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance , and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability .::::in
His changes of mood did not offend me , because I saw that I had nothing to <<target>> with their alternation ; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me .::::do
One day he had had company to dinner , and had sent for my portfolio ; in order , doubtless , to exhibit its contents : the gentlemen went away <<target>> , to attend a public meeting at Millcote , as Mrs. Fairfax informed me ; but the night being wet and inclement , Mr. Rochester did not accompany them .::::early
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell : a <<target>> came that I and Adele were to go downstairs .::::message
I brushed Adele 's hair and made her neat , and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim , where there was nothing to retouch -- all being too close and plain , <<target>> locks included , to admit of disarrangement -- we descended , Adele wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come ; for , owing to some mistake , its arrival had hitherto been delayed .::::braided
She was gratified : there it stood , a little <<target>> , on the table when we entered the dining-room .::::carton
She appeared to know <<target>> by instinct .::::it
exclaimed she , <<target>> towards it .::::running
`` Yes , there is your 'boite ' at last : take it into a corner , you genuine daughter of Paris , and amuse yourself with <<target>> it , '' said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester , proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside .::::disembowelling
`` And mind , '' he continued , `` do n't bother me with any details of the anatomical process , or any <<target>> of the condition of the entrails : let your operation be conducted in silence : tiens-toi tranquille , enfant ; comprends-tu ? ''::::notice
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning -- she had already retired to a sofa <<target>> her treasure , and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid .::::with
Having removed this impediment , and lifted certain silvery <<target>> of tissue paper , she merely exclaimed --::::envelopes
and then remained absorbed <<target>> ecstatic contemplation .::::in
`` Is Miss <<target>> there ? ''::::eyre
now demanded the master , half rising from his seat to <<target>> round to the door , near which I still stood .::::look
well , come forward ; <<target>> seated here . ''::::be
He drew a chair <<target>> his own .::::near
It would be intolerable to me to pass <<target>> whole evening _tete-a-tete_ with a brat .::::a
Do n't draw that chair farther off , Miss Eyre ; sit down <<target>> where I placed it -- if you please , that is .::::exactly
Nor do I particularly <<target>> simple-minded old ladies .::::affect
By-the-bye , I must have mine in mind ; it wo n't do to neglect her ; she is <<target>> Fairfax , or wed to one ; and blood is said to be thicker than water . ''::::a
He rang , and despatched an invitation to Mrs. <<target>> , who soon arrived , knitting-basket in hand .::::fairfax
`` Good evening , madam ; I <<target>> to you for a charitable purpose .::::sent
I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents , and she is bursting with repletion : have the goodness <<target>> serve her as auditress and interlocutrice ; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed . ''::::to
Adele , indeed , no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax , than she summoned her to her sofa , and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain , the <<target>> , the waxen contents of her `` boite ; '' pouring out , meantime , explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of .::::ivory
`` Now I have performed the part of a good host , '' pursued Mr. Rochester , `` put my guests <<target>> the way of amusing each other , I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure .::::into
Miss Eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ; I can <<target>> see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which I have no mind to do . ''::::not
I did as I was bid , though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade ; but Mr. <<target>> had such a direct way of giving orders , it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly .::::rochester
We were , as I have said , in the dining-room : the lustre , which had been lit for dinner , filled the room with a festal breadth of light ; the large fire was all red and clear ; the purple curtains hung <<target>> and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch ; everything was still , save the subdued chat of Adele ( she dared not speak loud ) , and , filling up each pause , the beating of winter rain against the panes .::::rich
Mr. Rochester , as he sat in his damask-covered chair , looked different to what <<target>> had seen him look before ; not quite so stern -- much less gloomy .::::i
There was a smile on his lips , and his eyes sparkled , whether with <<target>> or not , I am not sure ; but I think it very probable .::::wine
He was , in short , in his after-dinner mood ; more expanded and genial , and also more self- indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning ; still he looked preciously grim , cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair , and receiving the light of the fire <<target>> his granite- hewn features , and in his great , dark eyes ; for he had great , dark eyes , and very fine eyes , too -- not without a certain change in their depths sometimes , which , if it was not softness , reminded you , at least , of that feeling .::::on

`` You examine me , Miss Eyre , '' said <<target>> : `` do you think me handsome ? ''::::he
there is something singular about you , '' said he : `` you have the air of a little _nonnette_ ; quaint , quiet , grave , and simple , as you sit with your hands before you , and your eyes generally bent on the carpet ( except , by-the-bye , when <<target>> are directed piercingly to my face ; as just now , for instance ) ; and when one asks you a question , or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply , you rap out a round rejoinder , which , if not blunt , is at least brusque .::::they

`` Sir , I was too <<target>> ; I beg your pardon .::::plain

And so , under pretence of softening the previous outrage , of stroking and <<target>> me into placidity , you stick a sly penknife under my ear !::::soothing

`` Mr. Rochester , allow me to disown my first answer : <<target>> intended no pointed repartee : it was only a blunder . ''::::i
`` Just so : I think so : <<target>> you shall be answerable for it .::::and
Criticise me : does my <<target>> not please you ? ''::::forehead
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow , and showed a solid <<target>> mass of intellectual organs , but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen .::::enough
`` Now , ma'am , <<target>> I a fool ? ''::::am
`` Far from <<target>> , sir .::::it
You would , perhaps , think me rude if I <<target>> in return whether you are a philanthropist ? ''::::inquired
Another stick of the penknife , when she pretended to pat my head : and that is because I <<target>> I did not like the society of children and old women ( low be it spoken ! ) .::::said
No , young lady , I am not a general philanthropist ; but I bear a conscience ; '' and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty , and which , fortunately <<target>> him , were sufficiently conspicuous ; giving , indeed , a marked breadth to the upper part of his head : `` and , besides , I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart .::::for
When I was as old as you , I was a feeling fellow enough , partial to the unfledged , unfostered , and unlucky ; but Fortune has knocked me about since : she has even kneaded me with her <<target>> , and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball ; pervious , though , through a chink or two still , and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump .::::knuckles
Yes : does that leave <<target>> for me ? ''::::hope
`` Decidedly he has had too much wine , '' I thought ; and I did not know what <<target>> to make to his queer question : how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed ?::::answer
`` You looked very much puzzled , Miss Eyre ; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome , yet a puzzled air becomes you ; besides , <<target>> is convenient , for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy , and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on .::::it
Young lady , I am disposed to <<target>> gregarious and communicative to-night . ''::::be
With this announcement he rose from his chair , and stood , leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece : in that attitude his <<target>> was seen plainly as well as his face ; his unusual breadth of chest , disproportionate almost to his length of limb .::::shape
I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man ; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port ; so much ease in his demeanour ; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance ; so haughty a reliance on <<target>> power of other qualities , intrinsic or adventitious , to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness , that , in looking at him , one inevitably shared the indifference , and , even in a blind , imperfect sense , put faith in the confidence .::::the
`` I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night , '' he repeated , `` and that is why I sent for you : <<target>> fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me ; nor would Pilot have been , for none of these can talk .::::the

I have almost forgotten you since : other ideas have driven yours from my head ; but to-night <<target>> am resolved to be at ease ; to dismiss what importunes , and recall what pleases .::::i
It would please me now to draw you out -- <<target>> learn more of you -- therefore speak . ''::::to
Instead of speaking , I smiled ; and <<target>> a very complacent or submissive smile either .::::not
I leave both the choice of subject and the <<target>> of treating it entirely to yourself . ''::::manner
Accordingly I sat and said nothing : `` If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking <<target>> showing off , he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person , '' I thought .::::and
He bent his head a little towards me , and with <<target>> single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes .::::a
I put my request in an <<target>> , almost insolent form .::::absurd
Miss Eyre , I <<target>> your pardon .::::beg
This is legitimate , _et j ' y tiens_ , as Adele would say ; and it is by virtue of this superiority , and this alone , that I desire you <<target>> have the goodness to talk to me a little now , and divert my thoughts , which are galled with dwelling on one point -- cankering as a rusty nail .

He had deigned an explanation , almost an apology , and I did <<target>> feel insensible to his condescension , and would not seem so .::::not
`` I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir -- quite willing ; <<target>> I can not introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ?::::but
Ask me questions , and I will <<target>> my best to answer them . ''::::do
`` Then , in the first place , do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful , abrupt , perhaps exacting , sometimes , on the grounds I stated , namely , that I am old <<target>> to be your father , and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations , and roamed over half the globe , while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house ? ''::::enough
`` Do as you <<target>> , sir . ''::::please
`` That is no answer ; or rather it is <<target>> very irritating , because a very evasive one .::::a
`` I do n't think , sir , you have a right to command me , merely because you are older than I , or because you <<target>> seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience . ''::::have
But I wo n't allow that , seeing that it would never suit my case , as <<target>> have made an indifferent , not to say a bad , use of both advantages .::::i
Leaving superiority out of the question , then , you must still agree to receive my <<target>> now and then , without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command .::::orders
I smiled : I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar -- he seems <<target>> forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders .::::to
`` The smile is very well , '' said he , <<target>> instantly the passing expression ; `` but speak too . ''::::catching
`` I was thinking , sir , that very few masters would trouble themselves to <<target>> whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders . ''::::inquire
you are my paid <<target>> , are you ?::::subordinate
Oh yes , I <<target>> forgotten the salary !::::had
Well then , on that mercenary ground , will <<target>> agree to let me hector a little ? ''::::you
`` And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms <<target>> phrases , without thinking that the omission arises from insolence ? ''::::and
`` I am sure , sir , I should never mistake informality for insolence : one I <<target>> like , the other nothing free-born would submit to , even for a salary . ''::::rather
Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary ; therefore , keep to <<target>> , and do n't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant .::::yourself
However , I mentally shake hands with you for your answer , despite its inaccuracy ; and as much for the manner in which it was said , as for the substance of the speech ; the manner was <<target>> and sincere ; one does not often see such a manner : no , on the contrary , affectation , or coldness , or stupid , coarse-minded misapprehension of one 's meaning are the usual rewards of candour .::::frank
Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would <<target>> answered me as you have just done .::::have
But I do n't mean to flatter you : if you are cast in a different <<target>> to the majority , it is no merit of yours : Nature did it .::::mould
And then , after all , I go too fast in my conclusions : for what I yet know , you <<target>> be no better than the rest ; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points . ''::::may
My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind : he seemed to read <<target>> glance , answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined --::::the
`` Yes , yes , you are right , '' said he ; `` I have plenty of faults of <<target>> own : I know it , and I do n't wish to palliate them , I assure you .::::my

I started , or rather ( for like other defaulters , I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances ) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age <<target>> one-and-twenty , and have never recovered the right course since : but I might have been very different ; I might have been as good as you -- wiser -- almost as stainless .::::of

Ere long , Adele 's little foot <<target>> heard tripping across the hall .::::was
She entered , transformed as <<target>> guardian had predicted .::::her
A dress of rose-coloured satin , very short , and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered , replaced the brown frock <<target>> had previously worn ; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead ; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals .::::she
`` Est-ce que ma <<target>> va bien ? ''::::robe
Tenez , je crois que <<target>> vais danser ! ''::::je
And spreading out her dress , she chasseed across the room till , having reached Mr. Rochester , she <<target>> lightly round before him on tip-toe , then dropped on one knee at his feet , exclaiming --::::wheeled
`` Monsieur , je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte ; '' then rising , <<target>> added , `` C'est comme cela que maman faisait , n'est-ce pas , monsieur ? ''::::she

It was one afternoon , when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds : and while she played with <<target>> and her shuttlecock , he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her .::::pilot
This passion Celine had professed to <<target>> with even superior ardour .::::return
`` And , Miss Eyre , so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome , that I installed her in an hotel ; gave her a complete <<target>> of servants , a carriage , cashmeres , diamonds , dentelles , & c. In short , I began the process of ruining myself in the received style , like any other spoony .::::establishment
Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me , I found her out ; but it was a warm night , and I <<target>> tired with strolling through Paris , so I sat down in her boudoir ; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence .::::was
No , -- I exaggerate ; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her : it was rather a <<target>> of pastille perfume she had left ; a scent of musk and amber , than an odour of sanctity .::::sort
I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences , <<target>> I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony .::::when
The balcony was furnished with a chair or two ; I sat down , and took out <<target>> cigar , -- I will take one now , if you will excuse me . ''::::a
Here ensued a pause , filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar ; having placed it to <<target>> lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air , he went on --::::his
`` I liked bonbons too in those days , Miss Eyre , and I was _croquant_ -- ( overlook the barbarism ) -- _croquant_ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the <<target>> streets towards the neighbouring opera-house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night , I recognised the 'voiture ' I had given Celine .::::fashionable
She was returning : of course my heart thumped <<target>> impatience against the iron rails I leant upon .::::with
The carriage stopped , as I had expected , at the hotel door ; my flame ( that is the very word for an opera inamorata ) alighted : though muffed in a cloak -- an <<target>> encumbrance , by-the-bye , on so warm a June evening -- I knew her instantly by her little foot , seen peeping from the skirt of her dress , as she skipped from the carriage-step .::::unnecessary
Bending over the balcony , I was about to murmur 'Mon ange ' -- in a tone , of course , which should be audible to the ear of love alone -- when a figure jumped from the <<target>> after her ; cloaked also ; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement , and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte cochere_ of the hotel .::::carriage
`` You never felt jealousy , <<target>> you , Miss Eyre ?::::did
Of course not : I need not ask <<target>> ; because you never felt love .::::you

But I tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into <<target>> and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current -- as I am now .::::whirl

He ground his teeth and was silent : he arrested <<target>> step and struck his boot against the hard ground .::::his
Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip , <<target>> to hold him so tightly that he could not advance .::::and
We were ascending the avenue when he thus <<target>> ; the hall was before us .::::paused
Lifting his eye to its battlements , he cast over them <<target>> glare such as I never saw before or since .::::a
Pain , shame , ire , impatience , disgust , detestation , seemed momentarily <<target>> hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow .::::to
Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount ; but another feeling rose and triumphed : something hard and <<target>> : self-willed and resolute : it settled his passion and petrified his countenance : he went on --::::cynical

Continuing then to pursue his walk in silence , I ventured <<target>> recall him to the point whence he had abruptly diverged --::::to

`` Oh , I <<target>> forgotten Celine !::::had
When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier , I seemed to hear a hiss , and the green snake of jealousy , <<target>> on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony , glided within my waistcoat , and ate its way in two minutes to my heart 's core .::::rising
he exclaimed , suddenly starting <<target>> from the point .::::again
`` Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this , young lady ; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly , as if <<target>> were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint , inexperienced girl like you !::::it
But the last singularity explains the first , as I intimated once before : you , <<target>> your gravity , considerateness , and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets .::::with
Besides , I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own : I know <<target>> is one not liable to take infection : it is a peculiar mind : it is a unique one .::::it
Happily I do not mean to harm it : but , <<target>> I did , it would not take harm from me .::::if

After this digression <<target>> proceeded --::::he
`` I remained <<target>> the balcony .::::in
So putting my hand in through the open window , I drew the curtain over it , leaving only an opening through which I could take observations ; then I closed the casement , <<target>> but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers ' whispered vows : then I stole back to my chair ; and as I resumed it the pair came in .::::all
My eye was quickly <<target>> the aperture .::::at
Celine 's chamber-maid entered , lit a lamp , <<target>> it on the table , and withdrew .::::left
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly : both removed their cloaks , and there was 'the Varens , ' shining in satin and jewels , -- my gifts of course , -- and there was her companion in an <<target>> 's uniform ; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte -- a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society , and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely .::::officer
On recognising him , the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken ; <<target>> at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an extinguisher .::::because
A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for ; she <<target>> only scorn ; less , however , than I , who had been her dupe .::::deserved

Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly , but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in <<target>> little way : especially Celine , who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects -- deformities she termed them .::::their

Opening the window , I walked in upon them ; liberated Celine from my protection ; gave her notice to vacate her hotel ; offered her a purse for <<target>> exigencies ; disregarded screams , hysterics , prayers , protestations , convulsions ; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne .::::immediate
Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him ; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms , <<target>> as the wing of a chicken in the pip , and then thought I had done with the whole crew .::::feeble
But unluckily the Varens , six months before , had given me this filette Adele , who , she affirmed , was my daughter ; and <<target>> she may be , though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance : Pilot is more like me than she .::::perhaps
Some years after I had broken with the mother , she abandoned her <<target>> , and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer .::::child
I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele 's part to be supported by me , nor do I now acknowledge any , for I am not her father ; but hearing that she was quite <<target>> , I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris , and transplanted it here , to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden .::::destitute
Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it ; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl , you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee : <<target>> will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place -- that you beg me to look out for a new governess , & c. -- Eh ? ''::::you
`` No : Adele is not answerable for either her mother 's faults or yours : I have a regard for her ; and now that I know <<target>> is , in a sense , parentless -- forsaken by her mother and disowned by you , sir -- I shall cling closer to her than before .::::she
How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family , who would hate her governess <<target>> a nuisance , to a lonely little orphan , who leans towards her as a friend ? ''::::as
`` Oh , that is the <<target>> in which you view it !::::light
Well , I must go in now ; <<target>> you too : it darkens . ''::::and
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot -- ran <<target>> race with her , and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock .::::a
When we went in , and I had removed her bonnet and coat , I took her on my knee ; kept her there an hour , allowing her to prattle as she liked : not rebuking even <<target>> little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed , and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character , inherited probably from her mother , hardly congenial to an English mind .::::some
Still she had her merits ; and I was disposed to <<target>> all that was good in her to the utmost .::::appreciate
I sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester , <<target>> found none : no trait , no turn of expression announced relationship .::::but
It was a pity : if she could but have been proved <<target>> resemble him , he would have thought more of her .::::to
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the <<target>> , that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me .::::night
As he had said , there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself : a wealthy Englishman 's passion for a French dancer , and her treachery to him , were every-day matters enough , no doubt , in <<target>> ; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood , and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs .::::society
I meditated wonderingly on this incident ; but gradually quitting it , as I found it for <<target>> present inexplicable , I turned to the consideration of my master 's manner to myself .::::the
The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a <<target>> to my discretion : I regarded and accepted it as such .::::tribute
His deportment had now for some weeks been <<target>> uniform towards me than at the first .::::more
I never seemed in his way ; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur : when he met me unexpectedly , the encounter seemed welcome ; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me : when summoned by formal <<target>> to his presence , I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him , and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit .::::invitation
I , indeed , talked comparatively little , <<target>> I heard him talk with relish .::::but
It was his nature to be communicative ; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways ( I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways , but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted , <<target>> strange novelty by which they were characterised ) ; and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered , in imagining the new pictures he portrayed , and following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed , never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion .::::the
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint : the friendly frankness , <<target>> correct as cordial , with which he treated me , drew me to him .::::as
I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master : yet he was <<target>> sometimes still ; but I did not mind that ; I saw it was his way .::::imperious
So happy , so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life , that I ceased to pine after kindred : my <<target>> crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge ; the blanks of existence were filled up ; my bodily health improved ; I gathered flesh and strength .::::thin
And was Mr. Rochester now <<target>> in my eyes ?::::ugly
No , reader : gratitude , and many associations , all pleasurable and genial , made his face the <<target>> I best liked to see ; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire .::::object
Yet I had not forgotten his faults ; indeed , I <<target>> not , for he brought them frequently before me .::::could
He was proud , sardonic , harsh to inferiority of every description : in my secret soul <<target>> knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others .::::i
I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies , higher principles , and <<target>> tastes than such as circumstances had developed , education instilled , or destiny encouraged .::::purer
I thought there were excellent materials in him ; though <<target>> the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled .::::for
I can not deny that I grieved for his grief , whatever <<target>> was , and would have given much to assuage it .::::that
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed , I could not sleep for thinking of his look when he <<target>> in the avenue , and told how his destiny had risen up before him , and dared him to be happy at Thornfield .::::paused
`` What alienates him <<target>> the house ?::::from
Will he leave <<target>> again soon ?::::it
Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at <<target>> time ; and he has now been resident eight weeks .::::a
If he does go , <<target>> change will be doleful .::::the
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing ; at any rate , I started wide <<target>> on hearing a vague murmur , peculiar and lugubrious , which sounded , I thought , just above me .::::awake
I wished I had kept my candle burning : the <<target>> was drearily dark ; my spirits were depressed .::::night
I rose and sat up <<target>> bed , listening .::::in
I tried again to sleep ; but my heart <<target>> anxiously : my inward tranquillity was broken .::::beat
The clock , far down in <<target>> hall , struck two .::::the
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched ; as if fingers had <<target>> the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside .::::swept
I said , `` <<target>> is there ? ''::::who
I was chilled <<target>> fear .::::with
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot , who , when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open , not <<target>> found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester 's chamber : I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings .::::unfrequently
Silence composes the nerves ; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again <<target>> the whole house , I began to feel the return of slumber .::::through
But it was not fated that <<target>> should sleep that night .::::i
A dream had scarcely approached my ear , when it <<target>> affrighted , scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough .::::fled
The head of my bed was near the door , and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside -- or rather , crouched by my pillow : but I <<target>> , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as I still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and I knew it came from behind the panels .::::rose
My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt ; my <<target>> , again to cry out , `` Who is there ? ''::::next
Ere long , steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase : a door had lately been <<target>> to shut in that staircase ; I heard it open and close , and all was still .::::made
`` Was that <<target>> Poole ?::::grace
and is she possessed <<target>> a devil ? ''::::with
I hurried on my frock and a shawl ; I withdrew <<target>> bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand .::::the
There was a candle burning just outside , <<target>> on the matting in the gallery .::::and
I was surprised at this circumstance : but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim , as if filled with smoke ; and , <<target>> looking to the right hand and left , to find whence these blue wreaths issued , I became further aware of a strong smell of burning .::::while
In the midst of blaze and vapour , Mr. <<target>> lay stretched motionless , in deep sleep .::::rochester
I shook him , but he only murmured <<target>> turned : the smoke had stupefied him .::::and
Not a moment could be lost : the very sheets were kindling , I rushed to his basin and <<target>> ; fortunately , one was wide and the other deep , and both were filled with water .::::ewer
The hiss of the quenched element , the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied <<target>> , and , above all , the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed , roused Mr. Rochester at last .::::it
Though it was now dark , I knew he was awake ; because I <<target>> him fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of water .::::heard
`` Is there <<target>> flood ? ''::::a
`` No , sir , '' I answered ; `` but there has been a fire : <<target>> up , do ; you are quenched now ; I will fetch you a candle . ''::::get
`` In the name of all the elves <<target>> Christendom , is that Jane Eyre ? ''::::in
`` What have you done with <<target>> , witch , sorceress ?::::me
Who is in the <<target>> besides you ?::::room
Have you plotted to <<target>> me ? ''::::drown
`` I will fetch you a candle , sir ; <<target>> , in Heaven 's name , get up .::::and
Somebody has plotted something : you can not too <<target>> find out who and what it is . ''::::soon
I am up now ; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet : wait two minutes till <<target>> get into some dry garments , if any dry there be -- yes , here is my dressing-gown .::::i
I did run ; I brought the <<target>> which still remained in the gallery .::::candle
He took it from my hand , held it up , and surveyed the bed , <<target>> blackened and scorched , the sheets drenched , the carpet round swimming in water .::::all
and who did <<target>> ? ''::::it
I briefly related to him what had transpired : the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery : the step ascending to the third storey ; the smoke , -- the smell of <<target>> which had conducted me to his room ; in what state I had found matters there , and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on .::::fire
{ `` What is it <<target>> who did it ? ''::::and
He listened very gravely ; his face , as I went on , expressed <<target>> concern than astonishment ; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded .::::more
`` Shall I <<target>> Mrs .::::call
No ; what the deuce <<target>> you call her for ?::::would
Let her sleep <<target>> . ''::::unmolested
`` Then I will fetch Leah , <<target>> wake John and his wife . ''::::and

I shall take <<target>> candle .::::the
I must pay a visit <<target>> the second storey .::::to
Do n't move , remember , <<target>> call any one . ''::::or
He went : I <<target>> the light withdraw .::::watched
He passed up the gallery very softly , unclosed the staircase door with as little <<target>> as possible , shut it after him , and the last ray vanished .::::noise
I was left <<target>> total darkness .::::in
A very long <<target>> elapsed .::::time
I grew weary : it was cold , in spite of the cloak ; and then I <<target>> not see the use of staying , as I was not to rouse the house .::::did
I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester 's displeasure by disobeying his orders , when the light <<target>> more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall , and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting .::::once
`` I hope it is he , '' thought <<target>> , `` and not something worse . ''::::i
He re-entered , pale <<target>> very gloomy .::::and
`` I have found it all out , '' said he , setting his <<target>> down on the washstand ; `` it is as I thought . ''::::candle
`` How , <<target>> ? ''::::sir
He made no reply , but stood with <<target>> arms folded , looking on the ground .::::his
At the end of a few minutes <<target>> inquired in rather a peculiar tone --::::he
`` I forget whether you said you saw <<target>> when you opened your chamber door . ''::::anything
`` No , sir , only <<target>> candlestick on the ground . ''::::the
`` But you heard <<target>> odd laugh ?::::an

Well , I shall <<target>> on the subject .::::reflect
Meantime , I am glad that you are the only person , <<target>> myself , acquainted with the precise details of to-night 's incident .::::besides
I will account for this state of affairs '' ( pointing to <<target>> bed ) : `` and now return to your own room .::::the
I shall do very well on the sofa in <<target>> library for the rest of the night .::::the
It is near four : -- in two <<target>> the servants will be up . ''::::hours
He seemed surprised -- very inconsistently so , <<target>> he had just told me to go .::::as
he exclaimed , `` are you quitting me <<target>> , and in that way ? ''::::already
`` You said I might <<target>> , sir . ''::::go
`` But not without taking leave ; not without a word or two of acknowledgment <<target>> good-will : not , in short , in that brief , dry fashion .::::and
Why , you have saved my life ! -- <<target>> me from a horrible and excruciating death !::::snatched
and you walk past me as <<target>> we were mutual strangers !::::if
At least shake <<target>> . ''::::hands
He held out his hand ; I gave him mine : he <<target>> it first in one , them in both his own .::::took
`` You have saved my life : I have <<target>> pleasure in owing you so immense a debt .::::a
I can not <<target>> more .::::say
Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an <<target>> : but you : it is different ; -- I feel your benefits no burden , Jane . ''::::obligation
He paused ; gazed at me : words almost visible trembled <<target>> his lips , -- but his voice was checked .::::on
`` I knew , '' he continued , `` you would do me good in some way , at some time ; -- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you : <<target>> expression and smile did not '' -- ( again he stopped ) -- '' did not '' ( he proceeded hastily ) `` strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing .::::their

But he still retained my hand , <<target>> I could not free it .::::and
I bethought myself <<target>> an expedient .::::of
`` I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax <<target>> , sir , '' said I .::::move
`` Well , leave me : '' he <<target>> his fingers , and I was gone .::::relaxed
I regained my couch , <<target>> never thought of sleep .::::but
Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet <<target>> , where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy .::::sea
I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore , sweet as the hills of Beulah ; and now and then a freshening gale , wakened by hope , <<target>> my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne : but I could not reach it , even in fancy -- a counteracting breeze blew off land , and continually drove me back .::::bore
Sense would resist delirium : <<target>> would warn passion .::::judgment
Too feverish to rest , I <<target>> as soon as day dawned .::::rose
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless <<target>> : I wanted to hear his voice again , yet feared to meet his eye .::::night
During the early part of the morning , I momentarily expected his coming ; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom , <<target>> he did step in for a few minutes sometimes , and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day .::::but
There were exclamations of `` What a mercy <<target>> was not burnt in his bed ! ''::::master
`` It is always dangerous to keep <<target>> candle lit at night . ''::::a
`` How providential that he had presence of <<target>> to think of the water-jug ! ''::::mind
`` I wonder he <<target>> nobody ! ''::::waked
`` It is to be hoped he will not take cold <<target>> sleeping on the library sofa , '' & c .::::with
Leah stood up in the window-seat , rubbing <<target>> panes of glass dimmed with smoke .::::the
I was about to address her , for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair : but , on advancing , <<target>> saw a second person in the chamber -- a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside , and sewing rings to new curtains .::::i
That woman was no <<target>> than Grace Poole .::::other
There she sat , staid and taciturn-looking , as usual , in her <<target>> stuff gown , her check apron , white handkerchief , and cap .::::brown
She was intent on her work , in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed : on her hard forehead , and in her commonplace features , was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see <<target>> the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder , and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair , and ( as I believed ) , charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate .::::marking
She looked up , while I still gazed at her : no start , no increase <<target>> failure of colour betrayed emotion , consciousness of guilt , or fear of detection .::::or
`` I will put her to some test , '' thought <<target>> : `` such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension . ''::::i
`` Has anything <<target>> here ?::::happened
I thought I heard the servants all <<target>> together a while ago . ''::::talking
`` Only master had been reading in his bed last night ; he fell asleep with his candle lit , and the curtains got on fire ; <<target>> , fortunately , he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught , and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer . ''::::but
`` A strange <<target>> ! ''::::affair
I said , in a low voice : then , looking <<target>> her fixedly -- '' Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ?::::at
Did no one hear <<target>> move ? ''::::him
She again raised her eyes to me , and this <<target>> there was something of consciousness in their expression .::::time
She seemed to examine me <<target>> ; then she answered --::::warily
Mrs. Fairfax 's room and yours are the nearest to master 's ; but Mrs. Fairfax <<target>> she heard nothing : when people get elderly , they often sleep heavy . ''::::said
She paused , and then added , with a sort of assumed indifference , but still in a marked and significant tone -- '' <<target>> you are young , Miss ; and I should say a light sleeper : perhaps you may have heard a noise ? ''::::but
`` I did , '' said I , dropping my voice , so that Leah , who was still polishing the panes , could not hear me , `` <<target>> at first I thought it was Pilot : but Pilot can not laugh ; and I am certain I heard a laugh , and a strange one . ''::::and
She took a new needleful of thread , waxed it carefully , threaded her <<target>> with a steady hand , and then observed , with perfect composure --::::needle
`` I was not dreaming , '' I said , <<target>> some warmth , for her brazen coolness provoked me .::::with
Again she looked at me ; and <<target>> the same scrutinising and conscious eye .::::with
`` Have you told master that <<target>> heard a laugh ? ''::::you
`` I have not had the opportunity <<target>> speaking to him this morning . ''::::of
`` You did not think of opening your <<target>> and looking out into the gallery ? ''::::door
She appeared to be cross-questioning me , <<target>> to draw from me information unawares .::::attempting
The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt , she would be playing <<target>> some of her malignant pranks on me ; I thought it advisable to be on my guard .::::of
`` Then you are not in the habit of bolting <<target>> door every night before you get into bed ? ''::::your
she wants to know my habits , that <<target>> may lay her plans accordingly ! ''::::she
Indignation again prevailed over prudence : I replied sharply , `` Hitherto I have <<target>> omitted to fasten the bolt : I did not think it necessary .::::often
I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall : but in future '' ( and I laid <<target>> stress on the words ) `` I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down . ''::::marked
`` It will be wise so to do , '' was her answer : `` this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know , and I never heard of <<target>> hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house ; though there are hundreds of pounds ' worth of plate in the plate-closet , as is well known .::::the
A deal of people , Miss , are for trusting all to Providence ; but I say Providence <<target>> not dispense with the means , though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly . ''::::will
And here she closed her harangue : a long one for <<target>> , and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress .::::her
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her <<target>> self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy , when the cook entered .::::miraculous
`` Mrs. Poole , '' said she , addressing Grace , `` the <<target>> ' dinner will soon be ready : will you come down ? ''::::servants
`` No ; just put my pint of porter and bit of <<target>> on a tray , and I 'll carry it upstairs . ''::::pudding
`` You 'll have <<target>> meat ? ''::::some
`` Just a morsel , and a taste <<target>> cheese , that 's all . ''::::of
`` And the <<target>> ? ''::::sago
`` Never mind it at present : I shall be coming <<target>> before teatime : I 'll make it myself . ''::::down
The cook here turned to me , saying that Mrs. <<target>> was waiting for me : so I departed .::::fairfax
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax 's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner , so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole , and still more in <<target>> the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning , or , at the very least , dismissed from her master 's service .::::pondering
He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality <<target>> night : what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her ?::::last
It was strange : a bold , vindictive , and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants ; so much in her <<target>> , that even when she lifted her hand against his life , he dared not openly charge her with the attempt , much less punish her for it .::::power
`` Yet , '' I reflected , `` she has been young once ; her youth would be <<target>> with her master 's : Mrs. Fairfax told me once , she had lived here many years .::::contemporary
Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided <<target>> eccentric : Grace is eccentric at least .::::and
What if a former caprice ( a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his ) has delivered him into her power , and she <<target>> exercises over his actions a secret influence , the result of his own indiscretion , which he can not shake off , and dare not disregard ? ''::::now
But , having reached this point of conjecture , Mrs. Poole 's square , flat figure , and uncomely , dry , <<target>> coarse face , recurred so distinctly to my mind 's eye , that I thought , `` No ; impossible !::::even
my supposition can <<target>> be correct .::::not
Yet , '' suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts , `` you are not beautiful either , and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you : <<target>> any rate , you have often felt as if he did ; and last night -- remember his words ; remember his look ; remember his voice ! ''::::at
I well remembered all ; language , glance , <<target>> tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed .::::and
She looked up with <<target>> sort of start .::::a
`` Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille , et vos joues <<target>> rouges : mais , rouges comme des cerises ! ''::::sont
`` I am hot , <<target>> , with stooping ! ''::::adele
She went on sketching ; <<target>> went on thinking .::::i
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I <<target>> been conceiving respecting Grace Poole ; it disgusted me .::::had
I compared myself with her , <<target>> found we were different .::::and
Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady ; <<target>> she spoke truth -- I was a lady .::::and
And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me ; I had more colour <<target>> more flesh , more life , more vivacity , because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments .::::and
`` I have never heard Mr. Rochester 's voice or step in the house to-day ; but surely I shall see him before night : I <<target>> the meeting in the morning ; now I desire it , because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient . ''::::feared
When dusk actually closed , and when Adele left me to go and <<target>> in the nursery with Sophie , I did most keenly desire it .::::play
I listened for the bell to ring below ; I listened for Leah coming up with a message ; I fancied sometimes <<target>> heard Mr. Rochester 's own tread , and I turned to the door , expecting it to open and admit him .::::i
The door remained shut ; darkness <<target>> came in through the window .::::only
Still it was not late ; he often sent for me at <<target>> and eight o'clock , and it was yet but six .::::seven
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night , when <<target>> had so many things to say to him !::::i
I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole , and to hear what he would answer ; I wanted to ask him plainly if <<target>> really believed it was she who had made last night 's hideous attempt ; and if so , why he kept her wickedness a secret .::::he
It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him ; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns ; it was one I chiefly delighted in , and a <<target>> instinct always prevented me from going too far ; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured ; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill .::::sure
Retaining every minute form of respect , every propriety of my station , I could still <<target>> him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint ; this suited both him and me .::::meet
A tread creaked on <<target>> stairs at last .::::the
Leah made her appearance ; but it was only to <<target>> that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax 's room .::::intimate
Thither I repaired , glad at least to go downstairs ; for that <<target>> me , I imagined , nearer to Mr. Rochester 's presence .::::brought
`` You must want your tea , '' said the good lady , <<target>> I joined her ; `` you ate so little at dinner .::::as
I am afraid , '' she continued , `` you are <<target>> well to- day : you look flushed and feverish . ''::::not
`` Oh , <<target>> well !::::quite
I never felt <<target>> . ''::::better
`` Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite ; <<target>> you fill the teapot while I knit off this needle ? ''::::will
Having completed her task , she rose to draw down the blind , which she had hitherto kept up , by <<target>> , I suppose , of making the most of daylight , though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity .::::way
`` It is fair to-night , '' said she , as she looked through the panes , `` though <<target>> starlight ; Mr. Rochester has , on the whole , had a favourable day for his journey . ''::::not
I did not know <<target>> was out . ''::::he
`` Oh , he set off <<target>> moment he had breakfasted !::::the
He is gone to the Leas , Mr. Eshton 's <<target>> , ten miles on the other side Millcote .::::place
`` Do you expect <<target>> back to-night ? ''::::him
Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions ; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society , that I believe he is a general favourite : the ladies are very fond of him ; though <<target>> would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes : but I suppose his acquirements and abilities , perhaps his wealth and good blood , make amends for any little fault of look .

`` Are there ladies <<target>> the Leas ? ''::::at
`` There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters -- very elegant young ladies indeed ; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram , <<target>> beautiful women , I suppose : indeed I have seen Blanche , six or seven years since , when she was a girl of eighteen .::::most
She came here to a Christmas <<target>> and party Mr. Rochester gave .::::ball
You should have seen the dining-room that day -- how <<target>> it was decorated , how brilliantly lit up !::::richly
I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present -- all of the first <<target>> families ; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening . ''::::county
`` Yes , <<target>> saw her .::::i
The dining-room doors were thrown open ; and , as it was Christmas-time , the servants were <<target>> to assemble in the hall , to hear some of the ladies sing and play .::::allowed
Mr. Rochester would have me to come in , and <<target>> sat down in a quiet corner and watched them .::::i
I never saw a more splendid scene : the ladies were magnificently dressed ; most of them -- at <<target>> most of the younger ones -- looked handsome ; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen . ''::::least
`` And what was <<target>> like ? ''::::she
`` Tall , fine bust , sloping shoulders ; long , graceful neck : olive complexion , dark and clear ; <<target>> features ; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester 's : large and black , and as brilliant as her jewels .::::noble
And then she had such a fine head of hair ; raven-black and so becomingly arranged : a <<target>> of thick plaits behind , and in front the longest , the glossiest curls I ever saw .::::crown
She was dressed in pure white ; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her <<target>> , tied at the side , and descending in long , fringed ends below her knee .::::breast
She wore an amber-coloured flower , too , in her hair : <<target>> contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls . ''::::it
`` Yes , indeed : and not only <<target>> her beauty , but for her accomplishments .::::for

`` And Miss Ingram : what sort <<target>> a voice had she ? ''::::of
`` A very rich and powerful one : she sang delightfully ; it <<target>> a treat to listen to her ; -- and she played afterwards .::::was

When once more alone , I reviewed the information I had got ; looked into my heart , examined its thoughts and feelings , and endeavoured to <<target>> back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination 's boundless and trackless waste , into the safe fold of common sense .::::bring
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life ; that a more <<target>> idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies , and swallowed poison as if it were nectar .::::fantastic

`` Whenever , in future , you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well <<target>> you , take out these two pictures and compare them : say , 'Mr .::::of
Rochester might probably win that noble lady 's love , if he chose to strive for it ; <<target>> it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian ? ' ''::::is
`` I 'll do it , '' I resolved : and having <<target>> this determination , I grew calm , and fell asleep .::::framed
An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons ; and in <<target>> than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram .::::less
It looked a lovely face enough , and when compared with the real head <<target>> chalk , the contrast was as great as self- control could desire .::::in
I derived benefit from the task : it had kept my head and hands employed , and <<target>> given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart .::::had
Ere long , I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of <<target>> discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit .::::wholesome
Thanks to it , I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm , which , <<target>> they found me unprepared , I should probably have been unequal to maintain , even externally .::::had
Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London , and thence to the Continent , and <<target>> show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come ; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected .::::not
When I heard this , I was beginning to <<target>> a strange chill and failing at the heart .::::feel
I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment ; but rallying my wits , and recollecting my principles , I at once called my sensations to order ; and it was <<target>> how I got over the temporary blunder -- how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester 's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest .::::wonderful
Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of <<target>> : on the contrary , I just said --::::inferiority
`` You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield , further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee , and <<target>> be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as , if you do your duty , you have a right to expect at his hands .::::to
Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him ; so do n't <<target>> him the object of your fine feelings , your raptures , agonies , and so forth .::::make
He is not of your order : keep to your caste , and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of <<target>> whole heart , soul , and strength , where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised . ''::::the
I went on with my day 's business tranquilly ; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield ; and <<target>> kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations : these thoughts I did not think to check ; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could .::::i
`` It is from the master , '' said <<target>> , as she looked at the direction .::::she
`` Now I suppose we shall know whether we <<target>> to expect his return or not . ''::::are
Why my hand shook , and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents <<target>> my cup into my saucer , I did not choose to consider .::::of
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation , I tied the string of Adele 's pinafore , which happened to <<target>> loose : having helped her also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk , I said , nonchalantly --::::be
`` Mr. Rochester is not likely to <<target>> soon , I suppose ? ''::::return
I do n't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him : he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared ; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out ; I am <<target>> get more kitchen hands from the George Inn , at Millcote , and from wherever else I can ; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets : so we shall have a full house of it . ''::::to
And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast <<target>> hastened away to commence operations .::::and
The three days were , as <<target>> had foretold , busy enough .::::she
I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean <<target>> well arranged ; but it appears I was mistaken .::::and
Three women were got to help ; and such scrubbing , such brushing , such washing of paint and beating of carpets , such taking down and putting up of pictures , <<target>> polishing of mirrors and lustres , such lighting of fires in bedrooms , such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths , I never beheld , either before or since .::::such
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it : the preparations for company <<target>> the prospect of their arrival , seemed to throw her into ecstasies .::::and
She would have Sophie to look over all her `` toilettes , '' as she called frocks ; <<target>> furbish up any that were `` _passees_ , '' and to air and arrange the new .::::to
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday <<target>> , in time for dinner at six .::::afternoon
During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras ; and <<target>> believe I was as active and gay as anybody -- Adele excepted .::::i
Still , now and then , I received a damping check to my cheerfulness ; and was , <<target>> spite of myself , thrown back on the region of doubts and portents , and dark conjectures .::::in
This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door ( which of late had always been kept locked ) open slowly , and give passage to the form of Grace Poole , in prim cap , white apron , and handkerchief ; when I watched her glide along the gallery , her quiet tread <<target>> in a list slipper ; when I saw her look into the bustling , topsy-turvy bedrooms , -- just say a word , perhaps , to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate , or clean a marble mantelpiece , or take stains from papered walls , and then pass on .::::muffled
She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day , eat her dinner , smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth , and <<target>> back , carrying her pot of porter with her , for her private solace , in her own gloomy , upper haunt .::::go
Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below ; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled , oaken chamber <<target>> the second storey : there she sat and sewed -- and probably laughed drearily to herself , -- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon .::::of
The strangest thing of all was , that not a soul in the house , except me , noticed her habits , <<target>> seemed to marvel at them : no one discussed her position or employment ; no one pitied her solitude or isolation .::::or
I once , indeed , overheard part of a dialogue between Leah <<target>> one of the charwomen , of which Grace formed the subject .::::and
Leah had been saying something I had <<target>> caught , and the charwoman remarked --::::not
And she is laying by : she goes <<target>> quarter to the bank at Millcote .::::every
I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave ; but I suppose <<target>> 's got used to the place ; and then she 's not forty yet , and strong and able for anything .::::she
It is too soon for her <<target>> give up business . ''::::to
`` She is a good hand , <<target>> daresay , '' said the charwoman .::::i
`` That it <<target>> not ! ''::::is
`` I wonder whether <<target>> master -- ''::::the
The charwoman was going on ; but here Leah turned and <<target>> me , and she instantly gave her companion a nudge .::::perceived
`` Does n't <<target>> know ? ''::::she
I heard the <<target>> whisper .::::woman
Leah shook her head , and <<target>> conversation was of course dropped .::::the
All I had gathered from it amounted to this , -- that there was a <<target>> at Thornfield ; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded .::::mystery
Thursday came : all work had been completed the previous evening ; carpets were laid down , bed-hangings festooned , radiant white counterpanes spread , toilet <<target>> arranged , furniture rubbed , flowers piled in vases : both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them .::::tables
The hall , too , was scoured ; and the great carved clock , as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase , were polished to the <<target>> of glass ; in the dining-room , the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate ; in the drawing-room and boudoir , vases of exotics bloomed on all sides .::::brightness
Afternoon arrived : Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown , her gloves , and her gold watch ; for it was her part to receive the company , -- to conduct <<target>> ladies to their rooms , & c. Adele , too , would be dressed : though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least .::::the
However , to please her , I allowed Sophie to apparel <<target>> in one of her short , full muslin frocks .::::her
For myself , I had no need to make any change ; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the <<target>> ; for a sanctum it was now become to me , -- '' a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble . ''::::schoolroom
It had been a mild , serene spring day -- one of those days which , towards the <<target>> of March or the beginning of April , rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer .::::end
`` I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the <<target>> Mr. Rochester mentioned ; for it is past six now .::::time
I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the <<target>> : one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote . ''::::road
She went to <<target>> window .::::the
`` Here he <<target>> ! ''::::is
`` Well , John '' ( leaning <<target>> ) , `` any news ? ''::::out
`` They 'll be here <<target>> ten minutes . ''::::in
Adele flew to <<target>> window .::::the
Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles ; two of the cavaliers were young , dashing-looking gentlemen ; the third was Mr. Rochester , on his <<target>> horse , Mesrour , Pilot bounding before him ; at his side rode a lady , and he and she were the first of the party .::::black
Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground , her veil streamed long on the breeze ; <<target>> with its transparent folds , and gleaming through them , shone rich raven ringlets .::::mingling
exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax , and away <<target>> hurried to her post below .::::she
The cavalcade , following the sweep of the drive , quickly turned <<target>> angle of the house , and I lost sight of it .::::the
Adele now petitioned to go down ; but I took her on my knee , and gave her to understand that she must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies , either now or at any other time , <<target>> expressly sent for : that Mr. Rochester would be very angry , & c. `` Some natural tears she shed '' on being told this ; but as I began to look very grave , she consented at last to wipe them .::::unless
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall : gentlemen 's deep tones and ladies ' silvery accents blent harmoniously together , and distinguishable above <<target>> , though not loud , was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall , welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof .::::all
Then light steps ascended the stairs ; and there was a tripping through the gallery , and soft <<target>> laughs , and opening and closing doors , and , for a time , a hush .::::cheerful
`` Elles changent de toilettes , '' said Adele ; who , <<target>> attentively , had followed every movement ; and she sighed .::::listening
`` Chez maman , '' said she , `` quand il y avait du monde , je le suivais partout , au salon et a leurs <<target>> ; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames , et c'etait si amusant : comme cela on apprend . ''::::chambres
`` Do n't you feel <<target>> , Adele ? ''::::hungry
`` Mais oui , mademoiselle : voila cinq ou <<target>> heures que nous n'avons pas mange . ''::::six
`` Well now , while the ladies are in their rooms , <<target>> will venture down and get you something to eat . ''::::i
And issuing from my asylum with precaution , I <<target>> a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen .::::sought
All in that region was fire and commotion ; the soup and fish were in the last stage of <<target>> , and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion .::::projection
In the servants ' hall two coachmen and three gentlemen 's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire ; the abigails , I <<target>> , were upstairs with their mistresses ; the new servants , that had been hired from Millcote , were bustling about everywhere .::::suppose
Threading this chaos , I at last reached the larder ; there I took possession of a cold chicken , a roll of <<target>> , some tarts , a plate or two and a knife and fork : with this booty I made a hasty retreat .::::bread
I had regained the gallery , and was just shutting the back-door behind me , when <<target>> accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers .::::an
I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors , and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage ; so <<target>> stood still at this end , which , being windowless , was dark : quite dark now , for the sun was set and twilight gathering .::::i
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another : each came <<target>> gaily and airily , with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk .::::out
For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery , conversing in a key of <<target>> subdued vivacity : they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill .::::sweet
Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high- <<target>> elegance , such as I had never before received .::::born
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom <<target>> , which she held ajar .::::door
`` What beautiful <<target>> ! ''::::ladies
`` Oh , I wish <<target>> might go to them !::::i
Do you think Mr. Rochester will send <<target>> us by-and-bye , after dinner ? ''::::for
Never mind the ladies to-night ; perhaps you will <<target>> them to-morrow : here is your dinner . ''::::see
She was really hungry , so the chicken and <<target>> served to divert her attention for a time .::::tarts
It was well I secured this forage , or both she , I , and Sophie , to whom I conveyed a share of our <<target>> , would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all : every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us .::::repast
The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten <<target>> were still running to and fro with trays and coffee- cups .::::footmen
I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual ; for she declared she could not <<target>> go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below , and people bustling about .::::possibly
Besides , she added , a message might possibly come from Mr. <<target>> when she was undressed ; `` et alors quel dommage ! ''::::rochester
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them ; <<target>> then for a change I took her out into the gallery .::::and
The hall lamp was now lit , and it amused her to <<target>> over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards .::::look
When the evening was far advanced , a sound of music issued from the drawing-room , whither the piano <<target>> been removed ; Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen .::::had
Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument ; it <<target>> a lady who sang , and very sweet her notes were .::::was
The solo over , a duet followed , and then a <<target>> : a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals .::::glee
I listened long : suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds , and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. <<target>> ; and when it caught them , which it soon did , it found a further task in framing the tones , rendered by distance inarticulate , into words .::::rochester
I looked at Adele , whose head leant against my shoulder ; her eyes were waxing <<target>> , so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed .::::heavy
It was near one before the <<target>> and ladies sought their chambers .::::gentlemen
The next day was as fine as its predecessor : it was devoted <<target>> the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood .::::by
They set out early in the forenoon , some on horseback , the <<target>> in carriages ; I witnessed both the departure and the return .::::rest
I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax , <<target>> was standing at the window with me --::::who
`` Yes , I daresay : <<target>> doubt he admires her . ''::::no
`` And she him , '' I added ; `` look how she leans her head towards him as if she were <<target>> confidentially ; I wish I could see her face ; I have never had a glimpse of it yet . ''::::conversing
`` You will see her this <<target>> , '' answered Mrs. Fairfax .::::evening
`` I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished <<target>> be introduced to the ladies , and he said : 'Oh !::::to
let her come into the drawing-room after dinner ; <<target>> request Miss Eyre to accompany her . ' ''::::and
`` Yes ; he said that from mere politeness : I <<target>> not go , I am sure , '' I answered .::::need
`` Well , I observed to him that as you were unused to company , I did not think you would <<target>> appearing before so gay a party -- all strangers ; and he replied , in his quick way -- 'Nonsense !::::like
If she objects , tell her it is my particular wish ; and if she <<target>> , say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy . ' ''::::resists
`` I will not give him <<target>> trouble , '' I answered .::::that
`` I will go , if no better may <<target>> ; but I do n't like it .::::be
Shall you be <<target>> , Mrs .::::there
I 'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of <<target>> a formal entrance , which is the most disagreeable part of the business .::::making
You must go into the drawing- room while it is empty , before the ladies leave the dinner-table ; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like ; you need <<target>> stay long after the gentlemen come in , unless you please : just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away -- nobody will notice you . ''::::not
`` Perhaps two or three <<target>> , certainly not more .::::weeks
After the Easter recess , Sir George Lynn , who was lately elected member for Millcote , will have to go up to town and take <<target>> seat ; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him : it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield . ''::::his
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach <<target>> I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room .::::when
Adele had been in a state of ecstasy all day , after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies <<target>> the evening ; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down .::::in
Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her , and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed , drooping clusters , <<target>> pink satin frock put on , her long sash tied , and her lace mittens adjusted , she looked as grave as any judge .::::her
No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire : when she was dressed , she sat demurely down in her little chair , taking care <<target>> to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it , and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready .::::previously
This I quickly was : my best dress ( the silver-grey one , purchased for Miss Temple 's wedding , and never worn <<target>> ) was soon put on ; my hair was soon smoothed ; my sole ornament , the pearl brooch , soon assumed .::::since
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that <<target>> the saloon where they were all seated at dinner .::::through
We found the apartment vacant ; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth , and <<target>> candles shining in bright solitude , amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned .::::wax
The crimson curtain hung before the arch : slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining <<target>> , they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur .::::saloon
Adele , who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression , <<target>> down , without a word , on the footstool I pointed out to her .::::sat
I retired to a window-seat , and taking a <<target>> from a table near , endeavoured to read .::::book
`` Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie <<target>> seule de ces fleurs magnifiques , mademoiselle ?::::une
Seulement pour completer <<target>> toilette . ''::::ma
`` You think too much of your 'toilette , ' <<target>> : but you may have a flower . ''::::adele
And I took a rose from a <<target>> and fastened it in her sash .::::vase
She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction , as <<target>> her cup of happiness were now full .::::if
I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress : there was something ludicrous <<target>> well as painful in the little Parisienne 's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress .::::as
A soft sound of rising now became audible ; the curtain was swept back from the arch ; through it appeared the dining-room , with its lit lustre pouring down light on <<target>> silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table ; a band of ladies stood in the opening ; they entered , and the curtain fell behind them .::::the
There were but eight ; yet , somehow , as they flocked <<target>> , they gave the impression of a much larger number .::::in
Some of them were very tall ; many were dressed in white ; and all had a <<target>> amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon .::::sweeping
I rose and curtseyed to them : one or two bent <<target>> heads in return , the others only stared at me .::::their
They dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and <<target>> of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds .::::buoyancy
I knew their names afterwards , and <<target>> as well mention them now .::::may
First , there was Mrs. Eshton <<target>> two of her daughters .::::and
Of her daughters , the eldest , Amy , was rather little : naive , and child-like in face <<target>> manner , and piquant in form ; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well .::::and
The second , Louisa , was taller and more elegant in figure ; with a very pretty <<target>> , of that order the French term _minois chiffone_ : both sisters were fair as lilies .::::face
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty , very erect , very haughty-looking , richly dressed in a satin robe of <<target>> sheen : her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume , and within the circlet of a band of gems .::::changeful
Her black satin dress , her scarf of rich foreign lace , and her <<target>> ornaments , pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame .::::pearl
But the three most distinguished -- partly , perhaps , because the tallest figures of <<target>> band -- were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters , Blanche and Mary .::::the
They were all three of <<target>> loftiest stature of women .::::the
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty : her shape was still fine ; her hair ( <<target>> candle-light at least ) still black ; her teeth , too , were still apparently perfect .::::by
She had Roman features and a double chin , disappearing into a throat like a pillar : these features appeared to me not only inflated and <<target>> , but even furrowed with pride ; and the chin was sustained by the same principle , in a position of almost preternatural erectness .::::darkened
She had , likewise , a fierce and a hard eye : it reminded me of Mrs. Reed 's ; she mouthed her <<target>> in speaking ; her voice was deep , its inflections very pompous , very dogmatical , -- very intolerable , in short .::::words
Mary was too slim for her height , <<target>> Blanche was moulded like a Dian .::::but
I regarded her , of <<target>> , with special interest .::::course
First , I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax 's description ; secondly , whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had <<target>> of her ; and thirdly -- it will out ! -- whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester 's taste .::::painted
The noble bust , the sloping shoulders , the graceful neck , the <<target>> eyes and black ringlets were all there ; -- but her face ?::::dark
Her face was like her mother 's ; a youthful unfurrowed likeness : <<target>> same low brow , the same high features , the same pride .::::the
she laughed continually ; her laugh was satirical , and so <<target>> the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip .::::was
Genius is said <<target>> be self-conscious .::::to
She entered into a discourse on <<target>> with the gentle Mrs. Dent .::::botany
I presently perceived she was ( what is vernacularly termed ) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent ; that is , <<target>> on her ignorance -- her _trail_ might be clever , but it was decidedly not good- natured .::::playing
She played : her execution was brilliant ; she sang : her voice was fine ; she talked French <<target>> to her mamma ; and she talked it well , with fluency and with a good accent .::::apart
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche ; softer features too , and a skin some shades fairer ( Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard ) -- but Mary was <<target>> in life : her face lacked expression , her eye lustre ; she had nothing to say , and having once taken her seat , remained fixed like a statue in its niche .::::deficient
The sisters were both <<target>> in spotless white .::::attired
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a <<target>> as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make ?::::choice
I could not tell -- I did <<target>> know his taste in female beauty .::::not
If he liked the majestic , she was the very <<target>> of majesty : then she was accomplished , sprightly .::::type
Most gentlemen would admire her , I thought ; and that he _did_ admire her , I already seemed to <<target>> obtained proof : to remove the last shade of doubt , it remained but to see them together .::::have
You are not to suppose , reader , that Adele has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at my feet : <<target>> ; when the ladies entered , she rose , advanced to meet them , made a stately reverence , and said with gravity --::::no
Lady Lynn had remarked , `` It is Mr. Rochester 's ward , <<target>> suppose -- the little French girl he was speaking of . ''::::i
And then they had called her to a sofa , where she now sat , ensconced between them , chattering alternately in French and broken English ; <<target>> not only the young ladies ' attention , but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn , and getting spoilt to her heart 's content .::::absorbing
I sit in the shade -- if any shade there be <<target>> this brilliantly-lit apartment ; the window-curtain half hides me .::::in
Mr. Eshton , the magistrate of the district , is gentleman-like : his hair is quite white , his eyebrows <<target>> whiskers still dark , which gives him something of the appearance of a `` pere noble de theatre . ''::::and
Lord Ingram , like his sisters , is very tall ; like them , also , he is handsome ; but he shares <<target>> 's apathetic and listless look : he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain .::::mary
He comes in last : I am not looking <<target>> the arch , yet I see him enter .::::at
I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles , on the meshes of the purse I am forming -- I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands , to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap ; whereas , I distinctly behold his figure , and I inevitably <<target>> the moment when I last saw it ; just after I had rendered him , what he deemed , an essential service , and he , holding my hand , and looking down on my face , surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow ; in whose emotions I had a part .::::recall
How near had I approached <<target>> at that moment !::::him
What had occurred since , calculated to <<target>> his and my relative positions ?::::change
Yet now , how distant , <<target>> far estranged we were !::::how
So far estranged , that I did not <<target>> him to come and speak to me .::::expect
I did not wonder , when , without looking at me , he took a seat <<target>> the other side of the room , and began conversing with some of the ladies .::::at
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them , and that I might gaze without being observed , than my eyes were <<target>> involuntarily to his face ; I could not keep their lids under control : they would rise , and the irids would fix on him .::::drawn
I looked , and had an acute pleasure in looking , -- a precious yet poignant pleasure ; pure gold , with a steely point of agony : <<target>> pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned , yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless .::::a
Most true is it that `` beauty is <<target>> the eye of the gazer . ''::::in
My master 's colourless , olive face , square , massive brow , broad and jetty eyebrows , deep eyes , strong features , firm , grim mouth , -- all energy , decision , will , -- were not beautiful , <<target>> to rule ; but they were more than beautiful to me ; they were full of an interest , an influence that quite mastered me , -- that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his .::::according
I had not intended to love him ; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of <<target>> there detected ; and now , at the first renewed view of him , they spontaneously arrived , green and strong !::::love
He made me love him <<target>> looking at me .::::without
I compared him <<target>> his guests .::::with
What was the gallant grace of the Lynns , the languid elegance of Lord Ingram , -- even <<target>> military distinction of Colonel Dent , contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power ?::::the
I had no sympathy in their appearance , their expression : yet I could imagine that most observers would <<target>> them attractive , handsome , imposing ; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking .::::call
I saw them smile , laugh -- it was nothing ; the light of the candles had as much <<target>> in it as their smile ; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh .::::soul

Yet , with all its faults , the children , who had been real to me , caught , chiefly by the youthful sense of fun and enjoyment , the attention of other children ; and the curious semi-belief one has in the phantoms of one 's brain made me dwell on their after life and share my discoveries with my friends , not , however , <<target>> them down till after the lapse of all these years the tenderness inspired by associations of early days led to taking up once more the old characters in The Two Sides of the Shield ; and the kind welcome this has met with has led to the resuscitation of the crude and inexperienced tale which never pretended to be more than a mere family chronicle .::::writing
'Return , and in the daily round Of duty and of love , <<target>> best wilt find that patient faith That lifts the soul above . '::::thou
The first years of her life <<target>> marked by few events .::::were
She was a quiet , steady , useful girl , finding her chief pleasure in nursing and teaching her brothers and sisters , and her chief annoyance in <<target>> mamma 's attempts to make her a fine lady ; but before she had reached her nineteenth year she had learnt to know real anxiety and sorrow .::::her
Her mother , after suffering much from grief at the loss of her two brothers , fell into so alarming a state of health , that her husband was obliged immediately <<target>> hurry her away to Italy , leaving the younger children under the care of a governess , and the elder boys at school , while Eleanor alone accompanied them .::::to
Their absence lasted nearly three years , and during the last winter , an engagement commenced between Eleanor and Mr. Francis Hawkesworth , rather to the surprise of Lady Emily , who wondered that he had been able to discover the real worth veiled beneath a <<target>> and retiring manner , and to admire features which , though regular , had a want of light and animation , which diminished their beauty even more than the thinness and compression of the lips , and the very pale gray of the eyes .::::formal
The family were about to return to England , where the marriage was to take place , when Lady Emily was attacked with a sudden illness , which her weakened frame was unable <<target>> resist , and in a very few days she died , leaving the little Adeline , about eight months old , to accompany her father and sister on their melancholy journey homewards .::::to
This loss made a great change in the views of Eleanor , who , as she considered the cares and annoyances which would fall on her father , when left to bear <<target>> whole burthen of the management of the children and household , felt it was her duty to give up her own prospects of happiness , and to remain at home .::::the
How could she leave the tender little ones to the care of servants -- trust <<target>> sisters to a governess , and make her brothers ' home yet more dreary ?::::her
She knew her father to be strong in sense and firm in judgment , but indolent , indulgent , and inattentive to details , and she could <<target>> bear to leave him to be harassed by the petty cares of a numerous family , especially when broken in spirits and weighed down with sorrow .::::not
Her brother Henry was the only person who knew what she had done , and he alone perceived something of tremulousness <<target>> her in the midst of the even cheerfulness with which she had from the first supported her father 's spirits .::::about
Mr. Mohun , however , did not long remain in ignorance , for <<target>> Hawkesworth himself arrived at Beechcroft to plead his cause with Eleanor .::::frank
He knew her value too well to give her up , and Mr. <<target>> would not hear of her making such a sacrifice for his sake .::::mohun
But Eleanor was also firm , and after weeks of unhappiness and uncertainty , it was at length arranged that she should remain at <<target>> till Emily was old enough to take her place , and that Frank should then return from India and claim his bride .::::home
Well did she discharge the duties which she had undertaken ; she kept her father 's mind at ease , followed out his views , managed the boys with discretion and gentleness , and made <<target>> sisters well-informed and accomplished girls ; but , for want of fully understanding the characters of her two next sisters , Emily and Lilias , she made some mistakes with regard to them .::::her
The clouds of sorrow , to her so dark and heavy , had been to them but morning mists , and the four years which had changed her from a happy girl into a thoughtful , anxious woman , had brought them to an age which , if it is full of the <<target>> of childhood , also partakes of the earnestness of youth ; an age when deep foundations of enduring confidence may be laid by one who can enter into and direct the deeper flow of mind and feeling which lurks hid beneath the freaks and fancies of the early years of girlhood .::::follies
But Eleanor had little sympathy <<target>> freaks and fancies .::::for
She knew the realities of life too well to build airy castles with younger and gayer spirits ; <<target>> sisters ' romance seemed to her dangerous folly , and their lively nonsense levity and frivolity .::::her
They were too childish to share in her confidence , and she was too busy and too much preoccupied to have <<target>> or mind for visionary trifles , though to trifles of real life she paid no small degree of attention .::::ear
It might have been otherwise had Henry Mohun lived ; but in the midst of the affection of all who knew him , honour from those who could appreciate his noble character , and triumphs <<target>> by his uncommon talents , he was cut off by a short illness , when not quite nineteen , a most grievous loss to his family , and above all , to Eleanor .::::gained
Unlike her , as he was joyous , high-spirited , full of fun , and overflowing with imagination and poetry , there was a very close bond of union between them , in the strong <<target>> of duty , the firmness of purpose , and energy of mind which both possessed , and which made Eleanor feel perfect reliance on him , and look up to him with earnest admiration .::::sense
With him alone she was unreserved ; he was the only person who could ever make her show a spark of liveliness , and <<target>> his death , it was only with the most painful efforts that she could maintain her composed demeanour and fulfil her daily duties .::::on
Years passed on , and still she felt the blank which Harry had left , almost as much as the first day that she <<target>> of his death , but she never spoke of him , and to her sisters it seemed as if he was forgotten .::::heard
The reserve which had begun to thaw under his influence , again returning , placed her a still greater distance <<target>> the younger girls , and unconsciously she became still more of a governess and less of a sister .::::from
Little did she know of the 'blissful dreams in secret shared ' between Emily , Lilias , and their brother Claude , and little <<target>> she perceive the danger that Lilias would be run away with by a lively imagination , repressed and starved , but entirely untrained .::::did
Whatever influenced Lilias , had , through her , nearly the same effect upon Emily , a gentle <<target>> , easily led , especially by Lilias , whom she regarded with the fondest affection and admiration .::::girl
The perils of fancy and romance were not , however , to be dreaded for Jane , the fourth sister , a strong resemblance of Eleanor in her clear common sense , love <<target>> neatness , and active usefulness ; but there were other dangers for her , in her tendency to faults , which , under wise training , had not yet developed themselves .::::of
Such were the three girls who were now left to assist each other in the management of the household , and who looked forward to their new offices with the <<target>> sensations of pleasure , anxiety , self- importance , and self-mistrust , suited to their differing characters , and to the ages of eighteen , sixteen , and fourteen .::::various

The long-delayed wedding took place on the 13th of January , 1845 , and the bride and bridegroom immediately departed for a year 's visit <<target>> Mr. Hawkesworth 's relations in Northumberland , whence they were to return to Beechcroft , merely for a farewell , before sailing for India .::::among
It was half-past nine in the evening , and the wedding over -- Mr. and Mrs. <<target>> gone , and the guests departed , the drawing-room had returned to its usual state .::::hawkesworth
It was a very large room , so spacious that it would have been waste and desolate , had it not been well filled with handsome , but heavy old-fashioned furniture , covered with <<target>> damask , and one side of the room fitted up with a bookcase , so high that there was a spiral flight of library steps to give access to the upper shelves .::::crimson
Opposite were four large windows , now hidden by their ample curtains ; and near them <<target>> at one end of the room a piano , at the other a drawing-desk .::::was
The walls were wainscoted with polished black oak , <<target>> panels reflecting the red fire-light like mirrors .::::the
Over the chimney-piece hung a portrait , by Vandyke , of a pale , dark cavalier , of noble mien , and with arched eyebrows , called by Lilias , in defiance of dates , by the name of Sir Maurice de Mohun , the hero <<target>> the family , and allowed by every one to be a striking likeness of Claude , the youth who at that moment lay , extending a somewhat superfluous length of limb upon the sofa , which was placed commodiously at right angles to the fire .::::of
The other side of the fire was Mr. Mohun 's special domain , and there he sat at his writing-table , abstracted by deafness and letter writing , from the various sounds of mirth and <<target>> , which proceeded from the party round the long narrow sofa table , which they had drawn across the front of the fire , leaving the large round centre table in darkness and oblivion .::::nonsense
This party had within the last half hour been somewhat thinned ; the three younger girls had gone to bed , the Rector of Beechcroft , Mr. Robert Devereux , had been called home <<target>> attend some parish business , and there remained Emily and Lilias -- tall graceful girls , with soft hazel eyes , clear dark complexions , and a quantity of long brown curls .::::to
She was putting her sister 's wedding cards into their shining envelopes , and directing them in readiness for the post the next morning , while they were sealed by <<target>> youth of the same age as Claude , a small slim figure , with light complexion and hair , and dark gray eyes full of brightness and vivacity .::::a

inquired Reginald , with an arch glance <<target>> his brother on the sofa .::::towards

And there is the Baron <<target>> at his watch . '::::looking
It was certain that he was the representative of a family which had been settled at Beechcroft ever since the Norman Conquest , and Lily was <<target>> proud of the name of Sir William de Moune in the battle roll , and of Sir John among the first Knights of the Garter .::::very
Her favourite was Sir Maurice , who had held out Beechcroft Court for six weeks <<target>> the Roundheads , and had seen the greater part of the walls battered down .::::against
Witnesses of the strength of the old castle yet remained in the massive walls and broad green ramparts , which enclosed what was now orchard and farm- <<target>> , and was called the Old Court , while the dwelling-house , built by Sir Maurice after the Restoration , was named the New Court .::::yard
Sir Maurice had lost many an acre in the cause of King Charles , and his new mansion <<target>> better suited to the honest squires who succeeded him , than to the mighty barons his ancestors .::::was
It was substantial and well built , with a square gravelled court in front , and great , solid , folding gates <<target>> into a lane , bordered with very tall well- clipped holly hedges , forming a polished , green , prickly wall .::::opening
There was a little door in one of these gates , which was scarcely ever shut , from whence a well-worn path led <<target>> the porch , where generally reposed a huge Newfoundland dog , guardian of the hoops and walkingsticks that occupied the corners .::::to
On the other side of the house was a terrace sloping down to <<target>> lawn and bowling-green , hedged in by a formal row of evergreens .::::a
In the wood was the cottage of Walter Greenwood , gamekeeper and woodman by hereditary succession , but able and willing to turn <<target>> hand to anything , and , in fact , as Adeline once elegantly termed him , the 'family tee totum . '::::his
To the right of the house there was a field , called Long Acre , bounded on the other side by the <<target>> road to Raynham , which led up the hill to the village green , surrounded by well-kept cottages and gardens .::::turnpike
Beyond was the blacksmith 's shop , more cottages , and Mrs. Appleton 's wondrous village warehouse ; and the lane , after passing by the handsome old <<target>> of Mr. Harrington , Mr. Mohun 's principal tenant , led to a bridge across a clear trout stream , the boundary of the parish of Beechcroft .::::farmhouse
'And wilt thou show no more , quoth <<target>> , Than doth thy duty bind ?::::he
I well perceive thy <<target>> is small . '::::love
On the Sunday evening which followed Eleanor 's wedding , Lilias was sitting next to Emily , and talking in very <<target>> tones , which after a time occasioned Claude to look up and say , 'What is all this about ?::::earnest
Something remarkably absurd <<target>> suspect . '::::i
cried Lily , 'only what must be the feeling <<target>> every person of any warmth of character ? '::::of
'No , no , Claude , I really mean <<target>> ( and Lily sincerely thought she did ) .::::it
I will not tell you if <<target>> are going to laugh . '::::you
'That depends upon what your principle may <<target>> to be , ' said Claude .::::chance
She will be much obliged <<target>> you for telling . '::::to
'She only says she can not bear people to do their duty , <<target>> not to act from a feeling of love , ' said Emily .::::and
'That is not fair , ' returned Lily , 'all I say is , that it is better that <<target>> should act upon love for its own sake , than upon duty for its own sake . '::::people
'What comes in rhyme <<target>> Lily ? '::::with
'Do n't be tiresome , Claude , I <<target>> want you to understand me . '::::really
For about a quarter of an hour he was left in peace , while Lily was busily employed with a pencil <<target>> paper , under the shadow of a book , and at length laid before him the following verses : -::::and
'What is the source of gentleness , The spring of human blessedness , Bringing the wounded spirit healing , The comforts high of heaven revealing , The lightener of each daily care , The wing of hope , the life of prayer , The zest of joy , the balm of sorrow , Bliss of to-day , hope of to-morrow , The glory of the sun 's bright <<target>> , The softness of the pale moon stream , The flow'ret 's grace , the river 's voice , The tune to which the birds rejoice ; Without it , vain each learned page , Cold and unfelt each council sage , Heavy and dull each human feature , Lifeless and wretched every creature ; In which alone the glory lies , Which value gives to sacrifice ?::::beam

'What have you <<target>> ? '::::there
said Mr. Mohun , who had come towards <<target>> while Claude was reading the lines .::::them
Taking the paper from Claude 's hand , he read it to himself , and then saying , 'Tolerable , Lily ; there are some <<target>> to alter , but you may easily make it passable , ' he went on to his own place , leaving Lilias triumphant .::::things
'Well , Claude , you see I have <<target>> great Baron on my side . '::::the
' I am of the Baron 's opinion , ' said <<target>> , 'the only wonder is that you doubted it . '::::claude
'You seemed to say that love <<target>> good for nothing . '::::was
' I said nothing but that <<target>> has a rhyme . '::::lily
'And saying that I was silly , was equivalent to <<target>> that love was nothing , ' said Lily .::::saying
'Well , I know I often am foolish , but not in this , ' <<target>> Lily ; ' I do say that mere duty is not lovable . '::::said
Lily set herself to reconsider some of her lines : but presently Emily left the room , Claude looked <<target>> , and Lily exclaimed , 'Now , Claude , let us make a trial of it . '::::up
'Well , ' said Claude , <<target>> again , and looking resigned .::::yawning
'Think how Eleanor went on telling us of duty , duty , duty -- never making allowances -- never relaxing her stiff rules about trifles -- never unbending from her duenna-like dignity -- never showing one spark of <<target>> -- making great sacrifices , but only because she thought them her duty -- because it was right -- good for herself -- only a higher kind of selfishness -- not because her feeling prompted her . '::::enthusiasm
'Certainly , feeling does not usually prompt people to give up <<target>> lovers for the sake of their brothers and sisters . '::::their
'She did it because it was her duty , ' said <<target>> , 'quite as if she did not care . '::::lily
' I wonder whether Frank thought <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::so
'At any rate you will confess that Emily is <<target>> much more engaging person , ' said Lily .::::a
'Certainly , I had rather talk nonsense <<target>> her , ' said Claude .::::to
'You feel it , though you will <<target>> allow it , ' said Lily .::::not
And then Eleanor , unpoetical -- never thrown off her balance by grief or joy , with no ups and downs -- no enthusiasm -- no <<target>> of the beautiful -- her highest praise `` very right , '' and tell me if there can be a better image of duty . '::::appreciation
Claude might have had some chance of bringing Lily to her senses , if he had allowed that there was some truth in what she had said ; but he thought the <<target>> so unjust in general , that he would not agree to any part of it , and only answered , 'You have very strange views of duty and of Eleanor . '::::accusation
replied Lily , ' I only ask you to watch ; Emily and I are determined to act on the <<target>> of love , and you will see if her government is not more successful than that of duty . '::::principle
Such was the principle upon which Lily intended her sister to govern the household , and <<target>> which Emily listened without knowing what she meant much better than she did herself .::::to
Emily 's own views , as far as she possessed any , were to get on as smoothly as she could , and make everybody pleased and happy , without much trouble to <<target>> , and also to make the establishment look a little more as if a Lady Emily had lately been its mistress , than had been the case in Eleanor 's time .::::herself
Mr. Mohun 's property was good , but he wished to avoid unnecessary display and expense , and he expected his daughters to follow out these views , keeping a wise check upon <<target>> , by looking over her accounts every Saturday , and turning a deaf ear when she talked of the age of the drawing-room carpet , and the ugliness of the old chariot .::::emily
Lily however , thought fit to despise all household affairs , and bestowed the chief of her attention on her own department -- the village school <<target>> poor people ; and she was also much engrossed by her music and drawing , her German and Italian , and her verse writing .::::and
Claude had more power over <<target>> than any one else .::::her
He was a gentle , amiable boy , of high <<target>> , but disposed to indolence by ill health .::::talent
In most matters he was , however , victorious over this propensity , which was chiefly visible in his love <<target>> easy chairs , and his dislike of active sports , which made him the especial companion of his sisters .::::of
A dangerous illness had occasioned his removal from Eton , and he had since been at <<target>> , reading with his cousin Mr. Devereux , and sharing his sisters ' amusements .::::home
Brisk , bold , and blithe -- ever busy and ever restless , she was generally known by <<target>> names of Brownie and Changeling , which were not inappropriate to her active and prying disposition .::::the
Excepting Claude and Emily , the young party were early risers , and Lily <<target>> had generally despatched a good deal of business before the eight o'clock breakfast .::::especially
At nine they went to church , Mr. Devereux having restored the custom of daily service , and after this , Mr. Mohun attended to his multitudinous affairs ; Claude <<target>> to the parsonage , -- Emily to the storeroom , Lily to the village , the younger girls to the schoolroom , where they were presently joined by Emily .::::went
Lily remained in her own room till one o'clock , when she joined the others in the schoolroom , and they read <<target>> some book of history till two , the hour of dinner for the younger , and of luncheon for the elder .::::aloud
They then went out , and on their return from evening service , which began at half-past four , the little ones had their <<target>> to learn , and the others were variously employed till dinner , the time of which was rather uncertain but always late .::::lessons
The evening passed pleasantly and quickly away in <<target>> , work , music , and chatter .::::reading
As Emily had expected , her first troubles were with Phyllis ; called , not the neat handed , <<target>> her sisters ; Master Phyl , by her brothers ; and Miss Tomboy , by the maids .::::by
She seemed born to be a trial of patience to all concerned with her ; <<target>> without many actual faults , except giddiness , restlessness , and unrestrained spirits .::::yet
In the drawing-room , schoolroom , and nursery she was continually in scrapes , and so often reproved and <<target>> , that her loud roaring fits of crying were amongst the ordinary noises of the New Court .::::repentant
She was terribly awkward when under constraint , or in learning any female accomplishment , but swift and <<target>> when at her ease , and glorying in the boyish achievements of leaping ditches and climbing trees .::::ready
She was not tall , but strong , square , firm , and active ; she had a round merry <<target>> , a broad forehead , and large bright laughing eyes , of a doubtful shade between gray and brown .::::face
Her mouth was wide , her nose turned up , her complexion healthy , but not rosy , and her stiff straight <<target>> hair was more apt to hang over her eyes , than to remain in its proper place behind her ears .::::brown
Adeline was very different ; her fair and brilliant complexion , her deep blue eyes and golden ringlets , made her a very lovely little creature ; her quietness <<target>> a relief after her sister 's boisterous merriment , and her dislike of dirt and brambles , continually contrasted with poor Phyllis 's recklessness of such impediments .::::was
A book was the only chance of interesting her ; but very few books took her fancy enough to occupy her long ; -- those few , however , she read over and over again , and when unusual <<target>> reigned in the drawing-room , she was sure to be found curled up at the top of the library steps , reading one of three books -- Robinson Crusoe , Little Jack , or German Popular Tales .::::tranquillity
Then Emily blamed her ungraceful position , Jane laughed at her uniform taste , and Lily proposed some story about modern <<target>> , such as Phyllis never could like , and the constant speech was repeated , 'Only look at Ada ! '::::children
till Phyllis considered her sister as a perfect <<target>> , and sighed over her own naughtiness .::::model
German Popular Tales were a recent introduction of Claude 's , for Eleanor had carefully excluded all fairy tales from her sisters ' library ; so great was her dread of works of fiction , that Emily and Lilias had never been allowed to read any <<target>> the Waverley Novels , excepting Guy Mannering , which their brother Henry had insisted upon reading aloud to them the last time he was at home , and that had taken so strong a hold on their imagination , that Eleanor was quite alarmed .::::of
One day Mr. Mohun chanced to refer to some passage in Waverley , and on finding that <<target>> daughters did not understand him , he expressed great surprise at their want of taste .::::his
Poor things , ' said Claude , 'they can not help it ; do <<target>> you know that Eleanor thinks the Waverley Novels a sort of slow poison ?::::not
They know no more of <<target>> than their outsides . '::::them
'Well , the sooner they know <<target>> inside the better . '::::the
'Then may we really read <<target>> , papa ? '::::them
'And welcome , ' <<target>> her father .::::said
This permission once given , the young ladies had no idea of moderation ; Lily 's heart and soul were wrapped up in whatever tale she chanced <<target>> be reading -- she talked of little else , she neglected her daily occupations , and was in a kind of trance for about three weeks .::::to
'Take care , ' said Mr. Mohun , 'let us be able <<target>> give a good account of ourselves when Eleanor comes . '::::to
' I am afraid , papa , ' said Lily , 'the truth is , that my head <<target>> been so full of Woodstock for the last few days , that I could do nothing . '::::has
'The Bride of <<target>> . '::::lammermoor
papa , I am afraid you must <<target>> very angry with me . '::::be
'No , no , Lily , not yet , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I do not think <<target>> quite knew what an intoxicating draught you had got hold of ; I should have cautioned you .::::you
Your negligence has not yet been a serious fault , <<target>> remember , that it becomes so after warning . '::::though
'Then , ' said Lily , ' I will just finish Peveril at once , and get it out of <<target>> head , and then read no more of the dear books , ' and she gave a deep sigh .::::my
'Lily would take the temperance pledge , on condition that she might <<target>> her bottle at a draught , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::finish
Lily laughed , and looked down , feeling quite unable to offer to give up Peveril before she had finished it , but her father relieved her , by saying in his kind voice , 'No , no , Lily , take my advice , read those books , for most of them are very <<target>> reading , and very pretty reading , and very useful reading , and you can hardly be called a well-educated person if you do not know them ; but read them only after the duties of the day are done -- make them your pleasure , but do not make yourself their slave . '::::good
'Lily , ' said Claude the next morning , as he saw <<target>> prepare her drawing-desk , 'why are you not reading Peveril ? '::::her
but I thought your feelings were with poor <<target>> in the Tower , ' said Claude .::::julian
'My feelings prompt me to sacrifice my pleasure in reading about <<target>> to please papa , after he spoke so kindly . '::::him
'If that is always the effect of your principle , <<target>> shall think better of it , ' said Claude .::::i
Lily , whether from her new principle , or her old habits of obedience , never ventured to touch one of her tempters till after five o'clock , but , as she was a very rapid reader , she generally contrived to devour more than a sufficient quantity every evening , so that she did not <<target>> them as much as she would , had she been less voracious in her appetite , and they made her complain grievously of the dulness of the latter part of Russell 's Modern Europe , which was being read in the schoolroom , and yawn nearly as much as Phyllis over the 'Pragmatic Sanction . '::::enjoy
She could hardly wait till one o'clock , before she settled herself at the schoolroom table with <<target>> work , and summoned every one , however occupied , to listen to the reading .::::her
'Multiplication Is a <<target>> . '::::vexation
It was a bright and beautiful afternoon in March , the song of the blackbird and thrush , and the loud chirp of the titmouse , came merrily through the schoolroom window , mixed with the sounds of happy voices in the garden ; the western sun shone brightly in , and tinged the white <<target>> wall with yellow light ; the cat sat in the window-seat , winking at the sun , and sleepily whisking her tail for the amusement of her kitten , which was darting to and fro , and patting her on the head , in the hope of rousing her to some more active sport .::::wainscoted
But in the midst of all these joyous sights and sounds , was heard a dolorous <<target>> repeating , 'three and four are -- three and four are -- oh dear !::::voice
they are -- seven , no , but I do not think <<target>> is a four after all , is it not a one ?::::it
And on the floor lay Phyllis , her back to the window , kicking <<target>> feet slowly up and down , and yawning and groaning over her slate .::::her
Presently the door opened , and Claude looked in , and very nearly departed again instantly , for Phyllis <<target>> that moment made a horrible squeaking with her slate-pencil , the sound above all others that he disliked .::::at
He , however , stopped , <<target>> asked where Emily was .::::and
'Out in the garden , ' answered <<target>> , with a tremendous yawn .::::phyllis
'Is this your time of <<target>> for arithmetic ? '::::day
'No , ' said Phyllis , 'only I had not done it by one o'clock to-day , and Lily said I must finish <<target>> learning my lessons for to-morrow , but I do not think I shall ever have done , it is so hard .::::after
'And is that the best <<target>> for doing sums ? '::::position
' I was obliged to lie down here to get out of the <<target>> of Ada 's sum , ' said Phyllis , getting up .::::way
'Get out of the way <<target>> Ada 's sum ? '::::of
'Yes , she left it on the table where I was sitting , where I could see it , and it is this <<target>> one , so I must not look at it ; I wish I could do sums as fast as she can . '::::very
'Could you not have turned the other <<target>> of the slate upwards ? '::::side
said Phyllis , as if a new <<target>> had broken in upon her .::::light
'But then I wanted to be out of sight of pussy , for I could not think a bit , while the kitten was at play <<target>> prettily , and I kicked my heels to keep from hearing the voices in the garden , for it does make me so unhappy ! '::::so
Some good-natured brothers would have told the little girl not to mind , and sent her out to enjoy herself , but Claude respected Phyllis 's honesty too much to <<target>> so , and he said , 'Well , Phyl , let me see the sum , and we will try if we can not conquer it between us . '::::do
Phyllis 's face cleared up in an instant , <<target>> she brought the slate to her brother .::::as
said he ; ' I <<target>> not understand . '::::do
'Compound Addition , ' said Phyllis , ' I did one <<target>> Emily yesterday , and this is the second . '::::with
cried Phyllis , <<target>> delighted .::::quite
'Suppose we set it again , more <<target>> ; but how is this ?::::clearly
When I was in the schoolroom we always <<target>> a sponge fastened to the slate . '::::had
'Yes , ' said Phyllis , ' I had one before Eleanor went , but my <<target>> broke , and I lost it , and Emily always forgets to give me another .::::string
I will run and wash the slate in the nursery ; <<target>> how shall we know what the sum is ? '::::but
'Why , I suppose I may look at Ada 's slate , though you must not , ' said Claude , laughing to himself at poor little honest simplicity , <<target>> he applied himself to cut a new point to her very stumpy slate-pencil , and she scampered away , and returned in a moment with her clean slate .::::as
'Oh , how nice and <<target>> it all looks ! '::::fresh
said she as he set <<target>> the clear large figures .::::down
' I can not think how you <<target>> do it so evenly . '::::can
'Now , Phyl , do not let the <<target>> scream if you can help it . '::::pencil
Claude found that Phyllis 's great <<target>> was with the farthings .::::difficulty
She could not understand the fractional figures , and only knew <<target>> far , that 'Emily said it never meant four . '::::thus
Claude began explaining , but his <<target>> attempt was far too scientific .::::first
Phyllis gave a desponding sigh , looking so mystified , that he began to believe that she was hopelessly dull , and to repent of having offered to help her ; but <<target>> last , by means of dividing a card into four pieces , he succeeded in making her comprehend him , and her eyes grew bright with the pleasure of understanding .::::at
Even then the difficulties were not conquered , her addition was very slow , and dividing by twelve and twenty seemed endless work ; at length <<target>> last figure of the pounds was set down , the slate was compared with Adeline 's , and the sum pronounced to be right .::::the
' I should like <<target>> kiss you . '::::to
Then away she bounded , clattered down stairs , and flew across the lawn to tell every one <<target>> met that Claude had helped her to do her sum , and that it was quite right .::::she
'Did you expect that it would be <<target>> hard for him , Phyl ? '::::too
'No , ' said Phyllis , 'but he said he <<target>> not do it as it was set . '::::could
'And whose fault <<target>> that ? '::::was
but he showed me how to set it better , ' said Phyllis , 'and he said that <<target>> he learnt the beginning of fractions , he thought them as hard as I do . '::::when
said Jane , 'you do not fancy <<target>> have come to fractions yet !::::you
Fine work you will make of <<target>> when you do ! '::::them
Regardless of her brother , who had not looked up from his <<target>> , Jane began reading her list of poor Phyllis 's misadventures .::::book
'Rachel had ordered her not to climb ; and she was crying because <<target>> could not see the nest that Wat Greenwood had found . '::::she
'On Tuesday she cried over her French grammar , and <<target>> a leaf out of the old spelling-book . '::::tore
' I do not know of anything on Wednesday , but on <<target>> she threw Ada down the steps out of the nursery . '::::thursday
that accounts for the dreadful screaming that I heard , ' said <<target>> ; ' I forgot to ask the meaning of it . '::::claude
' I am sure it was Phyl that was the most <<target>> , and cried the loudest , ' said Lily .::::dismayed
'On Friday we had an uproar in the schoolroom about her hemming , and on Saturday she tumbled into a wet <<target>> , and tore her bonnet in the brambles ; on Sunday , she twisted her ancles together at church . '::::ditch
'Well , there I did chance to observe her , ' said Lily , 'there seemed to be a constant struggle <<target>> her ancles and herself , they were continually coming lovingly together , but were separated the next moment . '::::between
'And to-day this sum , ' said <<target>> ; 'seven scrapes in one week !::::jane
I really am of opinion , as Rachel says when she is <<target>> , that school is the best place for her . '::::angry
cried Lily , 'you do not mean that you would have that poor dear merry Master Phyl sent to school , she <<target>> pine away like a wild bird in a cage ; but papa will never think of such a thing . '::::would
you think we are too indulgent , ' said Emily ; 'perhaps we are , <<target>> you know we can not torment a poor child all day long . '::::but
'If you call the way you treat her indulgent , <<target>> should like to know what you call severe . '::::i
' I call your indulgence something like the tender <<target>> of the wicked , ' said Claude .::::mercies
'On a fine day , when every one is taking their pleasure in the garden , to shut an unhappy child up in the schoolroom , with a hard sum that <<target>> have not taken the trouble to teach her how to do , and late in the day , when no one 's head is clear for difficult arithmetic -- '::::you
'Hard sum do you <<target>> it ? '::::call
'Indeed I explained it to <<target>> , ' said Emily .::::her
'She might have learnt if she had attended , ' said <<target>> ; 'Ada understood clearly , with the same explanation . '::::emily
'And pray , Mrs. Senior Wrangler , ' said Claude , 'will you tell <<target>> where is the difference between a half-penny and half a penny ? '::::me
After a good laugh at Jane 's expense , Emily went on , 'Now , Claude , I will tell you how it happened ; Phyllis is so slow , and dawdles over her lessons so <<target>> , that it is quite a labour to hear her ; Ada is quick enough , but if you were to hear Phyllis say one column of spelling , you would know what misery is .::::long
Then before she has half finished , the clock strikes one , it is <<target>> to read , and the lessons are put off till the afternoon .::::time
'And the reading at one is as <<target>> as fate , ' said Claude .::::fixed
said Jane , 'when we were about old `` Russell , '' we did not begin till nearly two , but since we have been reading <<target>> book , Lily will never let us rest till we begin ; she walks up and down , and hurries and worries and -- '::::this
'Yes , ' said Emily , in a murmuring voice , 'we should do better if Lily would not make such a point <<target>> that one thing ; but she never minds what else is cut short , and she never thinks of helping me .::::of
It never seems to enter her head how much I have on <<target>> hands , and no one does anything to help me . '::::my
' I knew you would not <<target>> it , ' said Emily .::::like
'No , it is not my way to complain , people may <<target>> how to help me if they choose to do it . '::::see
returned Lily , 'do not say so , you know it was Emily that I called <<target>> example of it , not myself , and see how forbearing she has been .::::an
It must be love , not duty , that calls me to the <<target>> , for no one ever said that was my province . '::::schoolroom
you give it a <<target>> narrow boundary . '::::very
Lilias , who , to say the truth , had been made more careful of her own conduct , by the wish to <<target>> her principle , really betook herself to the schoolroom for an hour every morning , with a desire to be useful .::::establish
She thought she did great things in undertaking those <<target>> of Phyllis 's which Emily most disliked .::::tasks
But Lilias was neither patient nor humble enough to be a good <<target>> , though she could explain difficult rules in a sensible way .::::teacher
Emily 's gentle manner made her instructions far more agreeable , though she was often neither clear nor correct in her explanations ; she was contented if the lessons were droned <<target>> in any manner , so long as she could say they were done ; she disliked a disturbance , and overlooked or half corrected mistakes rather than cause a cry .::::through
Phyllis naturally preferred being taught by her , <<target>> Lily was vexed and unwilling to persevere .::::and
She went to the schoolroom expecting to be annoyed , created vexation <<target>> herself , and taught in anything but a loving spirit .::::for
Still , however , the thought of Claude , and the wish to do more than her duty , kept her constant to her <<target>> , and her love of seeing things well done was useful , though sadly counterbalanced by her deficiency in temper and patience .::::promise
'The deeds we do , the words we say , Into still air they <<target>> to fleet ; We count them past , But they shall last . '::::seem
Soon after Easter , <<target>> went to Oxford .::::claude
He was much missed by his sisters , who wanted him to carve for them at luncheon , to escort them when they rode <<target>> walked , to hear their music , talk over their books , advise respecting their drawings , and criticise Lily 's verses .::::or
A new subject of interest was , however , arising for them in the neighbours who were shortly expected to arrive at Broom <<target>> , a house which had lately been built in a hamlet about a mile and a half from the New Court .::::hill
These new comers were the family of a barrister of the name of Weston , who had taken the house for the sake <<target>> his wife , her health having been much injured by her grief at the loss of two daughters in the scarlet fever .::::of
Two still remained , a grown-up young lady , and a girl of eleven years old , and <<target>> Miss Mohuns learnt with great delight that they should have near neighbours of their own age .::::the
They had never had any young companions as young ladies were scarce among their acquaintance , <<target>> they had not seen their cousin , Lady Florence Devereux , since they were children .::::and
It was with great satisfaction that Emily and Lilias set out with their father to make the <<target>> visit , and they augured well from their first sight of Mrs. Weston and her daughters .::::first
Mrs. Weston was alone , her daughters being out walking , and Lily spent the greater part of the visit in silence , though her mind was made up <<target>> the first ten minutes , as she told Emily on leaving the house , 'that Miss Weston 's tastes were in complete accordance with her own . '::::in
But Mrs. Weston is a <<target>> sweet person . '::::very
'And , Emily , did you see the music-book <<target>> at `` Angels ever bright and fair ? ''::::open
If Miss Weston sings that <<target>> I imagine it ! '::::as
I only saw it <<target>> a beautiful piano .::::was
it made me doubly ashamed of our faded carpet and <<target>> , almost as old as the house itself . '::::chairs
said Lily , in her most earnest tones , ' I would not <<target>> one of those dear old chairs for a king 's ransom ! '::::change
She had the pleasure of lionising the two sisters over the Old Court , telling all she knew and <<target>> she imagined about the siege , Sir Maurice Mohun , and his faithful servant , Walter Greenwood .::::all
'Because they say I am as bad as <<target>> Margaret about the king 's visit . '::::lady
' I have not heard the story often enough to think so , ' <<target>> Miss Weston , ' I will warn you if I do . '::::said
'What , ' she cried , 'have you never seen the tufts of red on the hazel , nor the fragrant golden palms , and never heard the <<target>> rush twittering out of the hedge , nor the first nightingale 's note , nor the nightjar 's low chirr , nor the chattering of the rooks ?::::blackbird
O what a store of <<target>> memories you have lost !::::sweet
Why , how can you understand <<target>> beginning of the Allegro ? '::::the
Both the Miss Westons had so much pleasure in making acquaintance with 'these delights , ' as <<target>> to compensate for their former ignorance , and soon the New Court rang with their praises .::::quite
Mr. Mohun thought very highly of the whole family , and rejoiced in such society for his daughters , and they speedily became <<target>> well acquainted , that it was the ordinary custom of the Westons to take luncheon at the New Court on Sunday .::::so
On her side , however , Alethea Weston felt some reluctance <<target>> become intimate with the young ladies of the New Court .::::to
She was pleased with Emily 's manners , interested by Lily 's earnestness and simplicity , and thought Jane a clever and amusing little creature , but even <<target>> engaging qualities gave her pain , by reminding her of the sisters she had lost , or by making her think how they would have liked them .::::their
A country house and neighbours like these had been the objects of many visions of their childhood , and now all <<target>> sweet sights and sounds around her only made her think how she should have enjoyed them a year ago .::::the
She felt almost jealous of Marianne 's liking for her new friends , lest they should steal her heart from Emma and Lucy ; but knowing that these were morbid and unthankful feelings , she struggled against them , and though she missed her sisters even more than when her mother and Marianne were <<target>> greater need of her attention , she let no sign of her sorrowful feeling appear , and seeing that Marianne was benefited in health and spirits , by intercourse with young companions , she gave no hint of her disinclination to join in the walks and other amusements of the Miss Mohuns .::::in

By Mrs. Weston 's request , Mr. Devereux had pointed out the families which were most in need <<target>> assistance , and Alethea made it her business to find out the best way of helping them .::::of

Mr. Devereux had been Rector of Beechcroft about a year <<target>> a half , and had hitherto been much liked .::::and
His parishioners had known him from a boy , and were interested about him , <<target>> though very young , there was something about him that gained their respect .::::and
Almost all his plans were going on well , and things were , on the whole , in a satisfactory state , though no one but Lilias expected even Cousin <<target>> to make a Dreamland of Beechcroft , and there were days when he looked worn and anxious , and the girls suspected that some one was behaving ill .::::robert

At half-past ten the rude music of the band of the Friendly Society came pealing from the top of the hill , then appeared two tall flags , crowned with guelder roses and peonies , then the great <<target>> drum , the clarionet blown by red-waist-coated and red- faced Mr. Appleton , the three flutes and the triangle , all at their loudest , causing some of the spectators to start , and others to dance .::::blue

You never told me which chapter I was to prepare ; I can not think what would become of your <<target>> if it was not for me , you could not get an answer to one question in three . '::::examinations

Mr. Devereux proceeded without attending to her , 'As I came down the hill from the club-dinner , old Mrs. Gage came out of Naylor 's house , and her daughter with her , <<target>> great anger , calling me to account for having spoken of her in a most unbecoming way , calling her the sour Gage , and trying to set the Squire against them .

Now , Jane , am I doing you any injustice in thinking that it <<target>> have been through you that this history went abroad into the village ? '::::must

'Only the sour Gage will <<target>> a little . '::::ferment
I did not expect that you would <<target>> this matter so lightly . '::::treat

Phyllis and Adeline left the room , and Jane walked up and down , considering whether she should venture to go down to tea ; perhaps her cousin had waited till the little girls had gone <<target>> he spoke to Mr. Mohun , or perhaps her red eyes might cause questions on her troubles ; she was still in doubt when Lily opened the door , a lamp in her hand .::::before

And has it done <<target>> mischief ? '::::much
Mrs. Gage `` pitched '' into Robert , as Wat Greenwood <<target>> say , and the christening is off again . '::::would

'Oh , it will not die , ' said Jane , ' <<target>> great fat healthy thing like that likely to die indeed ! '::::a
'If I had done such a thing , I do not think <<target>> could have a happy minute till it was set right . '::::i

'Oh , tell papa and Robert I <<target>> very sorry , ' said Jane .::::am
On her way downstairs in the dark Lilias was led , by the example of her cousin , to reflect that she was not without <<target>> share in the mischief that had been done ; the words which report imputed to Mr. Devereux were mostly her own or Jane 's .::::some
There was no want of candour in Lily , and as soon as she entered the drawing-room she went straight up to her <<target>> and cousin , and began , 'Poor Jenny is very unhappy ; she desired me to tell you how sorry she is .::::father

But wishes had <<target>> effect .::::no
Lilias and Jane had to mourn over the <<target>> extent of harm done by hasty words .::::full
After the more respectable men had left the Mohun Arms on the evening of Whit-Monday , the rest gave way to <<target>> drunkenness , not so much out of reckless self- indulgence , as to defy the clergyman and the squire .::::unrestrained
They came to the front of the parsonage , yelled and groaned <<target>> some time , and ended by breaking down the gate .::::for
This conduct was repeated on Tuesday , and on many Saturdays following ; some young trees in the churchyard were cut , and abuse of the parson <<target>> on the walls the idle young men taking this opportunity to revenge their own quarrels , caused by Mr. Devereux 's former efforts for their reformation .::::written
On Sunday several children were absent from school ; all those belonging to Farmer Gage 's labourers were <<target>> away , and one man was turned off by the farmers for refusing to remove his child .::::taken
Now that the war was carried on so openly , Mr. Mohun considered it his <<target>> to withdraw his custom from one who chose to set his pastor at defiance .::::duty
He went to the forge , and had a long conversation with the blacksmith , but though he was listened to with respect , it was not easy to make much impression on an ignorant , hot-tempered man , who had been greatly offended , and prided himself on showing that he would support <<target>> quarrel of his wife and her relations against both squire and parson ; and though Mr. Mohun did persuade him to own that it was wrong to be at war with the clergyman , the effect of his arguments was soon done away with by the Gages , and no ground was gained .::::the
Mr. Gage 's farm was unhappily at no great distance from a dissenting chapel and school , in the adjoining parish <<target>> Stoney Bridge , and thither the farmer and blacksmith betook themselves , with many of the cottagers of Broom Hill .::::of
One alone of the family of Tom Naylor refused to join him in his dissent , and that was his sister , Mrs. Eden , a widow , with one little girl about seven years old , who , though in great measure <<target>> upon him for subsistence , knew her duty too well to desert the church , or to take her child from school , and continued her even course , toiling hard for bread , and uncomplaining , though often munch distressed .::::dependent
Jane was grieved at heart , but would not confess it , and Lilias <<target>> so restless and unhappy , that Emily was quite weary of her lamentations .::::was
'Maidens should be mild and meek , Swift <<target>> hear , and slow to speak . '::::to
Miss Weston had been much interested by what she heard respecting Mrs. Eden , and gladly discovered that <<target>> was just the person who could assist in some needlework which was required at Broom Hill .::::she
She asked Lilias to tell her where to find her cottage , and Lily replied by an offer to show her the way ; Miss Weston hesitated , thinking that perhaps <<target>> the present state of things Lily had rather not see her ; but her doubts were quickly removed by this speech , ' I want to see her particularly .::::in
I have been there three <<target>> without finding her .::::times
I think I can set this terrible <<target>> right by speaking to her . '::::matter
Accordingly , Lilias and Phyllis set out with Alethea and Marianne one afternoon to Mrs. Eden 's <<target>> , which stood at the edge of a long field at the top of the hill .::::cottage
Very fast did Lily talk all the way , but she grew more silent as she came to the cottage , and knocked at the door ; it was opened by Mrs. Eden herself , <<target>> pale , but rather pretty young woman , with a remarkable gentle and pleasing face , and a manner which was almost ladylike , although her hands were freshly taken out of the wash-tub .::::a
She curtsied low , and coloured at the sight of Lilias , <<target>> chairs for the visitors , and then returned to her work .::::set
Mrs. Eden , ' Lily began , intending to make her explanation , but feeling confused , thought it better to wait till her <<target>> 's business was settled , and altered her speech into 'Miss Weston is come to speak to you about some work . '::::friend
Mrs. Eden looked quite relieved , and Alethea proceeded to appoint the day for her coming to Broom Hill , and arrange some small matters , <<target>> which Lily not only settled what to say , but worked herself into a fit of impatience at the length of Alethea 's instructions .::::during
When they were concluded , however , and there was a pause , her words failed her , and <<target>> wished that she was miles from the cottage , or that she had never mentioned her intentions .::::she
At last she stammered <<target>> , 'Oh !::::out
Mrs. Eden -- I wanted to speak to you <<target>> -- about Mr. Devereux and your brother . '::::about
Mrs. Eden bent over her wash-tub , Miss Weston examined the shells on the chimney-piece , <<target>> and Phyllis listened with all their ears , and poor Lily was exceedingly uncomfortable .::::marianne
Indeed , he did not say <<target>> things about the Gages . '::::those
' I told my brother I did not think Mr. Devereux would go for to <<target>> such a thing , ' said Mrs. Eden , as much confused as Lily .::::say
The mischief was all my <<target>> and Jane 's .::::making
We said those foolish things , and they <<target>> repeated as if it was he .::::were

It was very good of you to <<target>> it was not Cousin Robert .::::think
I can not bear that things should <<target>> on in this dreadful way . '::::go
'Indeed , Miss , I am very <<target>> , ' said Mrs. Eden .::::sorry
'But , Mrs Eden , I am sure that would set <<target>> right again , ' said Lily , 'are not you ?::::it
I would do anything to have <<target>> poor baby christened . '::::that
Lily 's confidence melted away as she saw that Mrs. Eden 's tears were falling fast , <<target>> she ended with , 'Only tell them , and we shall see what will happen . '::::and
' I am <<target>> sorry . '::::very
'Your brother must soon see that Mr. Devereux <<target>> wishes to do his duty . '::::only
Alethea skilfully covered Lily 's retreat , and the party took <<target>> of Mrs. Eden , and turned into their homeward path .::::leave
Lily at first seemed disposed to be silent , and Miss Weston therefore amused herself <<target>> listening to the chatter of the little girls as they walked on before them .::::with
'There are only thirty-six days to the holidays , ' said Phyllis ; 'Ada and <<target>> keep a paper in the nursery with the account of the number of days .::::i

William was the only one of us who was <<target>> him , even papa was not there .::::with

Well , Harry was very like him , only not so tall and strong , with <<target>> same clear hazel eyes , and more pink in his cheeks -- fairer altogether .::::the
Then Harry wrote , saying that he <<target>> caught one of his bad colds .::::had
We heard no more for a week , and then one morning Eleanor was sent <<target>> out of the schoolroom , and there was Robert come to tell us .::::for
it was such <<target>> thunderbolt .::::a
This was what <<target>> the mischief .::::did
You know papa and mamma being from home so long , the elder boys had no settled place for the holidays ; sometimes they stayed <<target>> one friend , sometimes with another , and so no one saw enough of them to find out how delicate poor Harry really was .::::with
I think papa had been anxious the only winter they were at home together , and Harry had been talked to and <<target>> to take care ; but in the summer and autumn he was well , and did not think about it .::::advised
He went to Oxford by the coach -- it was a bitterly cold frosty day -- there was <<target>> poor woman outside , shivering and looking very ill , and Harry changed places with her .::::a
He was horribly chilled , but thinking he had <<target>> a common cold , he took no care .::::only
Harry just knew him , <<target>> that was all .::::and
He could not speak , <<target>> died that night .::::and
'It must have been <<target>> terrible shock . '::::a
'Such a loss -- he was <<target>> very good and clever .::::so
Every one looked up to him -- William <<target>> as much as the younger ones .::::almost
He never was in any scrape , had all sorts of prizes <<target>> Eton , besides getting his scholarship before he was seventeen . '::::at
Whenever Lily could get Miss Weston alone , it <<target>> her way to talk in this manner .::::was
She loved the sound of her own voice so well , that <<target>> was never better satisfied than when engrossing the whole conversation .::::she
Having nothing to talk of but her books , her poor people , and her family , she gave her friend the full benefit of all she could <<target>> on each subject , while Alethea had kindness enough to listen with real interest to her long rambling discourses , well pleased to see her happy .::::say
The next time they met , Lilias told her all she knew or imagined respecting Eleanor , and of her own debate with Claude , <<target>> ended , 'Now , Miss Weston , tell me your opinion , which would you choose for a sister , Eleanor or Emily ? '::::and
'Now what should <<target>> think ? '::::you

Then Harry died , and when Claude came home , and saw how changed things were , how gray papa 's hair had turned , and <<target>> silent and melancholy William had grown , he set himself with all his might to make up to papa as far as he could .::::how
I can not see that Henry himself could have been more than Claude is now ; he has not spared himself in the least , his tutor says , and he would <<target>> had the Newcastle Scholarship last year , if he had not worked so hard that he brought on one of his bad illnesses , and was obliged to come home .::::have
Now I am sure that he has acted from love , for it was <<target>> much his duty to take pains while Harry was alive as afterwards . '::::as

Is not St. Paul 's description of charity <<target>> like the duty to our neighbour ? '::::very
'The practice is the same , but <<target>> the theory , ' said Lily .::::not

The holidays arrived , and with them the three brothers , for during the first few weeks of the Oxford vacation Claude <<target>> Lord Rotherwood on visits to some college friends , and only came home the same day as the younger ones .::::accompanied
Maurice did not long leave his sisters in doubt as to what was to be his reigning taste , for as soon as dinner was over , he made Jane find the volume of <<target>> Encyclopaedia containing Entomology , and with his elbows on the table , proceeded to study it so intently , that the young ladies gave up all hopes of rousing him from it .::::the
Claude threw himself down on the sofa to enjoy the luxury of a desultory talk with his sisters ; and Reginald , his head on the floor , <<target>> his heels on a chair , talked loud and fast enough for all three , with very little regard to what the damsels might be saying .::::and
Claude , ' said Lily , 'you can not think how much we <<target>> Miss Weston , she lets us call her Alethea , and -- '::::like
Here came an interruption from Mr. Mohun , who perceiving the position of <<target>> 's dusty shoes , gave a loud 'Ah -- h ! '::::reginald

Then he said Faith Longley was of a better set of people , but I am sure it would give one the <<target>> to see her lumbering about the house , and then he talked it over with Robert and with Rachel . '::::nightmare
'And was not Rachel against it , or was <<target>> too kind to her young ladies ? '::::she
she was cross when she talked it over with us , ' said Lily ; 'but <<target>> coaxed her over , and she told the Baron it would do very well . '::::we
'He was quite with us , for he likes Esther <<target>> much as I do , ' said lily .::::as
'Now , Lily , ' said Jane , 'how can you say he was quite with you , when he <<target>> he thought it would be better if she was farther from home , and under some older person ? '::::said
'Yes , but he allowed that she would be much <<target>> here than at home , ' said Lily .::::safer
'But I thought she used to be the head of <<target>> the ill behaviour in school , ' said Claude .::::all

'Since she has been in MY <<target>> , ' Claude repeated .::::class
'Well , ' said Lily , with a slight <<target>> , 'it is just what Robert says .::::blush

And how are the <<target>> , Lily ?::::verses
The next afternoon , as soon as luncheon was over , Lily drew Claude out to his favourite place under the plane-tree , where she proceeded to inflict her poem upon his patient ears , while he lay flat upon the <<target>> looking up to the sky ; Emily and Jane had promised to join them there in process of time , and the four younger ones were , as usual , diverting themselves among the farm buildings at the Old Court .::::grass
Lily began : ' I meant to have two parts about Sir Maurice going out to fight when he was very young , and then about his brothers being killed , and King Charles knighting him , and his betrothed , Phyllis Crossthwayte , embroidering his black engrailed <<target>> on his banner , and then the taking the castle , and his being wounded , and escaping , and Phyllis not thinking it right to leave her father ; but I have not finished that , so now you must hear about his return home .

muttered Claude to himself ; but as Lily did not understand or know whence his quotation <<target>> , it did not hurt her feelings , and she went merrily on : -::::came
'It is a pity they should sing of it in <<target>> lines as those last four , ' said Claude .::::such
'Let me see , I like your bringing in the real names , <<target>> I doubt whether any but Greenwood could have been found here . '::::though

'Yes , Jane has no feeling for poetry , ' said <<target>> , with simplicity , which made her brother smile .::::lily
Jane and Emily now came up , the former with her <<target>> , the latter with a camp-stool and a book .::::work
' I wonder , ' said <<target>> , 'where those boys are !::::she
By the bye , what character did <<target>> bring home from school ? '::::they
'Maurice 's mind only half given to his work , <<target>> Redgie 's whole mind to his play . '::::and
'Maurice 's talent does not lie in the direction <<target>> Latin and Greek , ' said Emily .::::of
'No , ' said Jane , 'it is nonsense to <<target>> him learn it , and so he says . '::::make
'Perhaps he would say the same of mathematics and mechanics , if <<target>> great a point were made of them , ' said Lily .::::as
' I think not , ' said Claude ; 'he <<target>> more notion of them than of Latin verses . '::::has
'Did I say <<target>> ? '::::so
'What is the use of <<target>> knowing those stupid languages ?::::his
I am sure it is wasting time not to improve such <<target>> genius as he has for mechanics and natural history .::::a

' I am sure you think with me , only you <<target>> too grand , and too correct to say so . '::::are
Claude made no answer , but Jane saw she was wrong by his countenance ; before she could <<target>> anything more , however , they were interrupted by a great outcry from the Old Court regions .::::say
'Oh , ' said Emily , ' I thought it was a <<target>> time since we had heard anything of those uproarious mortals . '::::long
' I hope there is nothing <<target>> matter , ' said Lily .::::the
'Aye , but among that party , ' said Emily , 'Redgie 's laugh is not always a proof <<target>> peace : they are too much in the habit of acting the boys and the frogs . '::::of
'We were better off , ' said Lily , 'with the <<target>> Claude , as Miss Middleton used to call him . '::::gentle
'Not even for <<target>> ladies ? '::::young
'No , Phyllis and Ada are much the <<target>> for being teased , ' said Claude .::::better
' I am convinced that I never did <<target>> duty by you in that respect . '::::my
'There were others to do it <<target>> you , ' said Jane .::::for
'His teasing was all performed upon Claude , ' said <<target>> , 'and a great shame it was . '::::lily
'Not at all , ' said Claude , 'only an injudicious <<target>> to put a little life into a tortoise . '::::attempt
' A bad comparison , ' said <<target>> ; 'but what is all this ?::::lily
Here come the <<target>> in dismay !::::children
What is the matter , <<target>> dear child ? '::::my
This was addressed to Phyllis , who was the first to come up at <<target>> speed , sobbing , and out of breath , 'Oh , the dragon-fly !::::full

In the meantime , Maurice came up at his <<target>> , holding his prize by the wings .::::leisure
' A demoiselle dragon-fly , ' <<target>> Lily ; 'what a beauty !::::said
what are you going to <<target>> with it ? '::::do
'Here , Jane , put it under this flower-pot , and take care <<target>> it , while I fetch something to kill it with . '::::of
'Oh , Maurice , <<target>> not ! '::::do
' I will <<target>> it . '::::do
'How came you be <<target>> cruel ? '::::so
'No , a squeeze will not do , ' said Maurice ; 'it would spoil <<target>> beauty ; I must put it ever the fumes of carbonic acid . '::::its
'Maurice , you really must <<target>> , ' said Emily .::::not
'Now do not , dear Maurice , ' said Ada , 'there 's <<target>> dear boy ; I will give you such a kiss . '::::a
'Well , ' interrupted Maurice , 'if you make such a fuss about killing it , I <<target>> stick a pin through it into a cork , and let it shift for itself . '::::will
Poor Phyllis ran away to the other end of the garden , sat down and sobbed , Ada <<target>> and argued , Emily complained , Lily exhorted Claude to interfere , while Reginald stood laughing .::::screamed
'Pray how is any one to make a <<target>> of natural objects without killing things ? '::::collection
' I do not see the use of a collection , ' said <<target>> ; 'you can examine the creatures and let them go . '::::lily
'Such a young lady 's tender-hearted <<target>> , ' said Reginald .::::notion
'Who ever heard of a man of science <<target>> in such a ridiculous way ? '::::managing
exclaimed Lily , 'when he will have forgotten <<target>> next Christmas that insects ever existed . '::::by
It was not convenient to hear this speech , so Maurice turned an empty flower-pot over his prisoner , and left it in Jane 's care while he <<target>> to fetch the means of destruction , probably choosing the lawn for the place of execution , in order to show his contempt for his sisters .::::went
'Fair damsel in boddice blue , ' said Lily , peeping in at the hole at <<target>> top of the flower-pot , ' I wish I could avert your melancholy fate .::::the
I am very sorry for you , <<target>> I can not help it . '::::but
'You might help it now , at <<target>> rate , ' muttered Claude .::::any
'No , ' said Lily , ' I know Monsieur <<target>> too well to arouse his wrath so justly .::::maurice

'There is a carriage coming to the <<target>> gate , ' cried Ada .::::front
'Emily , may I <<target>> into the drawing-room ?::::go
Oh , Jenny , will you <<target>> my brown holland apron ? '::::undo
'That is right , little mincing Miss , ' said Reginald , <<target>> a low bow ; 'how fine we are to-day . '::::with
'How visitors break into the afternoon , ' said <<target>> , with a languid turn of her head .::::emily
'Jenny , brownie , ' called Maurice from his bedroom <<target>> , ' I want the sulphuric acid . '::::window
Jane sprang up and ran into the house , though her sisters called after <<target>> , that she would come full upon the company in the hall .::::her
'They shall not catch me here , ' <<target>> Reginald , rushing off into the shrubbery .::::cried
'Send Ada to call me , if there <<target>> any one worth seeing , ' said Claude::::is
'They will see you from the <<target>> , ' said Emily .::::window
'No , ' said Claude , 'no one ever found <<target>> out last summer , under these friendly branches . '::::me
The old butler , Joseph , now showed himself on the terrace ; and the young ladies , knowing that he had <<target>> intention of crossing the lawn , hastened to learn from him who their visitors were , and entered the house .::::no
Just then Phyllis came running back from the kitchen garden , and without looking round , or perceiving Claude , she took up the flower-pot and released <<target>> captive , which , unconscious of its peril , rested on a blade of grass , vibrating its gauzy wings and rejoicing in the restored sunbeams .::::the
I wish I had not <<target>> you such a fright .::::given

I am very glad God <<target>> you so beautiful .::::made
I must blow upon you <<target>> make you go .::::to
Oh , that is right -- up quite high in the air -- quite safe , ' and she clapped her hands as the dragon-fly rose in <<target>> air , and disappeared behind the laurels , just as Maurice and Reginald emerged from the shrubbery , the former with a bottle in his hand .::::the
'Well , where is <<target>> Libellulla ? '::::the
' I let <<target>> out . '::::it
cried Reginald , laughing at <<target>> brother 's disaster .::::his
'Upon my word , Phyl , <<target>> are very kind ! '::::you
'If I had known you were <<target>> an ill-natured crab -- '::::such
Maurice dear , do n't say <<target>> , ' exclaimed Phyllis .::::so
' I thought I might let it out because I caught it myself ; and I told you I did <<target>> catch it for you to kill ; Maurice , indeed , I am sorry I vexed you . '::::not
'What else did you <<target>> it for ? '::::do
'It is horrid not to be able to <<target>> one 's things a minute -- '::::leave
'But I did not know the dragon-fly belonged <<target>> you , Maurice , ' said Phyllis .::::to
'That is a puzzler , Mohun <<target>> , ' said Reginald .::::senior
'Now , Redgie , do get Maurice to leave off <<target>> angry with me , ' implored his sister .::::being
' I will leave off being angry , ' said Maurice , seeing his <<target>> , 'if you will promise never to let out my things again . '::::advantage
' I do not think I <<target>> promise , ' said Phyllis .::::can
' O yes , you can , ' said <<target>> , 'you know they are not his . '::::reginald
'Promise you will not let out any insects I may get , ' said <<target>> , 'or I shall say you are as cross as two sticks . '::::maurice
' I 'll tell you what , Maurice , ' said Phyllis , ' I do wish you would not make me promise , <<target>> I do not think I CAN keep it , for I can not bear to see the beautiful live things killed . '::::for
'Nonsense , ' said Maurice , fiercely , ' I am <<target>> angry indeed , you naughty child ; promise -- '::::very
' I can not , ' <<target>> Phyllis , beginning to cry .::::said
'Then , ' said Maurice , ' I <<target>> not speak to you all day . '::::will
'No , no , ' shouted Reginald , 'we will only treat her like the horse- stinger ; you wanted a <<target>> , Maurice -- here is one for you , here , give her a dose of the turpentine . '::::puella
'Yes , ' said Maurice , advancing with his bottle ; 'and do you take the poker <<target>> to Naylor 's to be sharpened , it will just do to stick through her back .::::down
no , not Naylor 's -- the girls have made a hash there , as they <<target>> everything else ; but we will settle her before they come out again . '::::do
Phyllis screamed and begged for mercy -- <<target>> last ally had deserted her .::::her
The matter was no joke to any one but Reginald , <<target>> Maurice was very angry and really meant to frighten her .::::for
'Hands off , boys , I will not have <<target>> bullied , ' said Claude , half rising .::::her
Maurice gave a violent start , Reginald looked round laughing , and <<target>> , 'Who would have thought of Claude sneaking there ? '::::exclaimed
and Phyllis ran to the protecting <<target>> , which he stretched out .::::arm
To her great surprise , he drew her to him , and <<target>> her forehead , saying , 'Well done , Phyl ! '::::kissed
'To be sure not , ' said Maurice , ' <<target>> only meant to have a little fun . '::::i
Claude , with his arm still round his sister 's waist , <<target>> Maurice a look , expressing , 'Is that the truth ? '::::gave
and Reginald tumbled head over heels , exclaiming , ' <<target>> would not have been Phyl just them . '::::i
Ada now came running up to them , saying , 'Maurice and Redgie , you are to come in ; Mr. <<target>> Mrs. Burnet heard your voices , and begged to see you , because they never saw you last holidays . '::::and
'More 's the pity they should see <<target>> now , ' said Maurice .::::us
'Papa is there , and he sent <<target>> you , ' said Ada .::::for
'Plague , ' <<target>> the answer .::::was
'See what you get by making such <<target>> row , ' said Claude .::::a
'If you had been as orderly members <<target>> society as I am -- '::::of
'Oh , but Claude , ' said Ada , 'papa <<target>> me to see if I could find you .::::told
'You are not worth it , Ada , ' <<target>> Reginald , and Claude did not contradict him .::::said
'But smiled to hear the creatures he had known So long <<target>> now in class and order shown - Genus and species .::::were
`` Is it meet , '' said he , `` This creature 's name should one so sounding be - 'T <<target>> but a fly , though first-born of the spring , Bombylius Majus , dost thou call the thing ? ''::::is
Claude never spoke to strangers more than he could help , Maurice and Reginald were in the room only a short time ; so that the result of Miss Weston 's observations , when <<target>> in reply to Lily 's eager inquiries , was only that Claude was very like his father and eldest brother , Reginald very handsome , and Maurice looked like a very funny fellow .::::communicated
On Monday , Reginald and Maurice were required to learn what they had always refused <<target>> acknowledge , that the holidays were not intended to be spent in idleness .::::to
A portion of each morning was to be devoted to study , Claude having undertaken the task of tutor -- and hard work he found it ; and much did Lily pity him , when , as not unfrequently happened , the summons to the children 's dinner would bring him from the <<target>> , looking thoroughly fagged -- Maurice in so sulky a mood that he would hardly deign to open his lips -- Reginald talking fast enough , indeed , but only to murmur at his duties in terms , which , though they made every one laugh , were painful to hear .::::study
Then Claude would take his brothers back to the study , and not appear for an hour <<target>> more , and when he did come forth , it was with a bad headache .::::or
Sometimes , as if to show that it was only through their own fault that their tasks were wearisome , one or both boys would finish quite early , when Reginald would betake himself to the schoolroom and employ his idle time in making it nearly impossible for Ada and Phyllis to learn , by talking , laughing , teasing the canary , <<target>> everything in pursuing wasps , making Emily fretful by his disobedience , and then laughing at her , and , in short , proving his right to the title he had given himself at the end of the only letter he had written since he first went to school , and which he had subscribed , 'Your affectionate bother , R .::::overturning
So that , for their own sake , <<target>> would have preferred the inattentive mornings .::::all
Lily often tried to persuade Claude to allow her to tell her <<target>> how troublesome the boys were , but never with any effect .::::father
He once took up a book he had been using with them , and pointing to the name in the first page , in writing , which Lily knew full well , 'Henry Mohun , ' she perceived that he meant to convince her that it was useless to try to dissuade <<target>> , as he thought the patience and forbearance his brother had shown to him must be repaid by his not shrinking from the task he had imposed upon himself with his young brothers , though he was often obliged to sit up part of the night to pursue his own studies .::::him
If Claude had rather injudiciously talked too much to Lilias of 'her principle , ' and thus <<target>> it alive in her mind , yet his example might have made its fallacy evident .::::kept
She believed that what she called love had been the turning point in his character , that it had been his earnest desire to follow in Henry 's steps , and so try to comfort his father for <<target>> loss , that had roused him from his indolence ; but she was beginning to see that nothing but a sense of duty could have kept up the power of that first impulse for six years .::::his
Lily began to enter a little into his principle , and many <<target>> that occurred during these holidays made her mistrust her former judgment .::::things
Did Emily show that softness , which was her most agreeable characteristic , in her whining reproofs- -in her complaints that 'no one listened <<target>> a word she said ' -- in her refusal to do justice even to those who had vainly been seeking for peace ?::::to
Did Lily herself show any of her much valued love , by the <<target>> manner in which she scolded the boys for roughness towards herself ?::::sharp
or for language often used by them on purpose <<target>> make her displeasure a matter of amusement ?::::to
She saw that her want of command of temper was a failure both in love and duty , <<target>> when irritated , the thought of duty came sooner to her aid than the feeling of love .::::and
And Maurice and Reginald <<target>> really very provoking .::::were
Maurice loved no amusement better than teasing his sisters , and this <<target>> almost the only thing in which Reginald agreed with him .::::was
Reginald was affectionate , but too reckless and violent not to be very troublesome , and he too often flew into a passion if Maurice attempted to laugh at him ; the <<target>> girls were often frightened and made unhappy ; Phyllis would scream and roar , and Ada would come sobbing to Emily , to be comforted after some rudeness of Reginald 's .::::little
It was not very often that quarrels went so far , but many a time in thought , word , and deed was the rule of love <<target>> , and more than once did Emily feel ready to give up all her dignity , to have Eleanor 's hand over the boys once more .::::transgressed
Claude , finding that he could do much to prevent mischief , took <<target>> not to leave the two boys long together with the elder girls .::::care
They were far more inoffensive when separate , as Maurice never practised his tormenting tricks when no one was <<target>> to laugh with him , and Reginald was very kind to Phyllis and Ada , although somewhat rude .::::present
It was a day or two after they returned that Phyllis was leaning on the window-sill in the drawing-room , watching <<target>> passing shower , and admiring the soft bright tints of a rainbow upon the dark gray mass of cloud .::::a
' I do set my bow in the cloud , ' repeated she to herself over and over again , until Adeline entering the <<target>> , she eagerly exclaimed , 'Oh Ada , come and look at this beautiful rainbow , green , and pink , and purple .::::room
A double one , with <<target>> many stripes , Ada .::::so
See , there is a <<target>> bit more green . '::::little
'There is no green in a <<target>> , ' said Ada .::::rainbow
'But look , Ada , <<target>> is green . '::::that
'It is not <<target>> green .::::real
said she , turning to her brother , who <<target>> , as usual , deep in entomology .::::was
You are right in saying that blue , <<target>> , and yellow are the prismatic colours .::::red
Now do you know what <<target>> a rainbow ? '::::causes
'It is to show there is never to be <<target>> flood , ' said Phyllis , gravely .::::another
'Oh , I did not mean that , ' said Maurice , addressing himself to Ada , whose love <<target>> hard words made him deem her a promising pupil , and whom he could lecture without interruption .::::of
'The rainbow is <<target>> by -- '::::caused
exclaimed Phyllis , remaining <<target>> mouth wide open .::::with
'The rainbow is occasioned by the refraction of the rays of the sun <<target>> the drops of water of which a cloud is composed . '::::in
'Well , what do you keep on `` <<target>> , Mauricing , '' about ? '::::but
'But , Maurice , I thought it said , `` <<target>> do set my bow in the cloud . ''::::i
' I know that , but I know the iris , or <<target>> , is a natural phenomenon occasioned by the refraction . '::::rainbow
'Why , Maurice , you believe the <<target>> , do n't you ? '::::bible
This last speech was heard by Lilias , who just <<target>> entered the room , and greatly surprised her .::::now
'What can you be <<target>> of ? '::::talking
'But only hear what he <<target>> , ' cried Ada .::::says
'He says the rainbow was not put there to <<target>> there is never to be another flood ! '::::show
'Now , Lily , ' said Maurice , ' I do not think there is much use in talking to you , but I wish you to <<target>> that all I said was , that the rainbow , or iris , is a natural phenomenon occasioned by the refraction of the solar -- '::::understand
'You will certainly bewilder yourself into something dreadful <<target>> that horrid science , ' said Lily .::::with
'What is the matter <<target>> Phyl ? '::::with
'Only crying because of what I <<target>> , ' answered Maurice .::::said
'So childish , and you <<target>> just as bad . '::::are
'But do you mean to say , ' exclaimed Lily , 'that <<target>> set this human theory above the authority of the Bible ? '::::you
Whereupon Phyllis cried the more , <<target>> Lily looked infinitely shocked .::::and
' I ca n't help it -- it is <<target>> allowed , ' said the boy doggedly .::::universally
It was fortunate that the next person who entered the room was Claude , and all at <<target>> he was appealed to by the four disputants , Lily the loudest and most vehement .::::once
'Claude , listen to him , and tell him to throw away these <<target>> new lights , which lead to everything that is shocking ! '::::hateful
'Listen to him , with three <<target>> talking at once ? '::::ladies
'No , not Phyl -- her tears only are eloquent ; but it is <<target>> mighty war about the token of peace and LOVE , Lily . '::::a
'The love would be in driving these horrible philosophical speculations <<target>> of Maurice 's mind , ' said Lily .::::out
'Do n't let her scratch out <<target>> eyes , Claude . '::::my
' I am not so sure of <<target>> maxim , ' said Claude .::::that
'Truth is chiefly injured -- I mean , her <<target>> weakened , by her own supporters . '::::force
'Umph , ' sighed Claude , throwing himself into his <<target>> 's arm-chair , `` tis a Herculean labour !::::father
It seems I agree <<target>> you both . '::::with
'Why , every Christian must be with me , who has not lost <<target>> way in a mist of his own raising , ' said Lilias .::::his
Look at them on those prisms ; ' and <<target>> pointed to an old-fashioned lustre on the chimney-piece .::::he
' I hope this is not a <<target>> of the Christian faith . '::::part
'Take care , Maurice , ' and Claude 's eyes were <<target>> upon him in a manner that made him shrink .::::bent
And he added , 'Of course I <<target>> believe that chapter about Noah .::::do
I only meant that the immediate cause of <<target>> rainbow is the refraction of light .::::the
I did not mean to be irreverent , only the <<target>> took me up in such a way . '::::girls
'And I know well enough that you can make those colours <<target>> light on drops of water , ' said Lily .::::by
'So you agreed all the <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::time
'But , ' added Lily , ' I never liked to know it ; for it always seemed to be explaining <<target>> the Bible , and I can not bear not to regard that lovely bow as a constant miracle . '::::away
'You will remember , ' said Claude , 'that some commentators say it should be , `` I HAVE set <<target>> bow in the cloud , '' which would make what already existed become a token for the future .::::my
' I do n't like that <<target>> , ' said Lily .::::explanation
'Others say , ' added Claude , 'that there might have been no rain at all till the windows of heaven were opened at the flood , and , in that <<target>> , the first recurrence of rain must have greatly alarmed Noah 's family , if they had not been supported and cheered by the sight of the rainbow .

' I hate reason applied to <<target>> , ' said Lily .::::revelation
'It is a happier state of mind which does not seek to apply it , ' said Claude , looking at Phyllis , who <<target>> dried her tears , and stood in the window gazing at him , in the happy certainty that he was setting all right .::::had
Maurice respected Claude for his science as much as his character , and did not make game of this observation as he would <<target>> it had been made by one of his sisters , but he looked at him with an odd expression of perplexity .::::if
'You do not think ignorant credulity <<target>> than reasonable belief ? '::::better
'It is not I only who think most highly of child-like unquestioning faith , Maurice , ' said <<target>> -- 'faith , that is based upon love and reverence , ' added he to Lily .::::claude
'But come , the shower is over , and philosophers , or <<target>> philosophers , I invite you to walk in the wood . '::::no
'Aye , ' said Maurice , ' I daresay <<target>> can find some of the Arachne species there .::::i
By the bye , Claude , do you think papa would let me have a <<target>> of plate-glass , eighteen by twenty , to cover my case of insects ? '::::piece
'Ask , and you will <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::discover
Accordingly , Maurice began the next morning at breakfast , 'Papa , <<target>> I have a piece of plate-glass , eighteen by -- ? '::::may
But no one heard , for Emily was at the moment <<target>> , 'The Westons are to dine here to-day . '::::saying
Claude and Maurice <<target>> looked blank .::::both
'You must expect that I shall not , you have given <<target>> so many orders on the subject , ' said Claude .::::me
'Take care it has not the same effect as to tell Maurice to like <<target>> book , ' said Emily ; 'nothing makes his aversion so certain . '::::a
'Except when he takes it up by mistake , and forgets <<target>> it has been recommended to him , ' said Claude .::::that
'Take care , Redgie , with your knife ; do n't <<target>> out my eyes in your ardour against that wretched wasp .::::put
Wat Greenwood may well say `` there is a <<target>> sight of waspses this year . '' '::::terrible
'And I will tell you what I saw , ' said Phyllis ; ' I was picking <<target>> apples , and the wasps were flying all round , and there came a hornet . '::::up
cried Maurice ; 'oh , <<target>> must have one ! '::::i
'Well , what of <<target>> hornet ? '::::the
' I 'll tell you what , ' resumed Phyllis , 'he saw a wasp flying , and so he <<target>> up in the air , and pounced on the poor wasp as the hawk did on Jane 's bantam .::::went
First he bit off the yellow tail , then the legs , and threw them away , and then <<target>> was nothing left but the head , and so he flew away with it to his nest . '::::there
'Which way did <<target>> go ? '::::he
'To the Old Court , ' answered Phyllis ; ' I think the nest is in the roof of the old cow-house , <<target>> they were flying in and out there yesterday , and one was eating out the wood from the old rails . '::::for
'Well , ' said Mr. Mohun , 'you must show me a hornet hawking for wasps before <<target>> nest is taken , Phyllis ; I suppose you have seen the wasps catching flies ? '::::the
but they pack them <<target>> quite differently .::::up
They do not hang by one leg , but they sit down quite <<target>> on a branch while they bite off the wings and legs . '::::comfortably
'There , Maurice , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I had rather hear of one <<target>> well-observed fact than of a dozen of your hard names and impaled insects . '::::such
Phyllis looked quite radiant with <<target>> at his approbation .::::delight
'But , papa , ' said Maurice , 'may I <<target>> a piece of plate-glass , eighteen by twenty ? '::::have
'When you observe facts in natural history , perhaps I may <<target>> something to your entomology , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::say
'But , papa , all my insects will be spoilt if I <<target>> not have a piece of glass , eighteen by -- '::::may
'He is , ' said Claude , reading the <<target>> , 'but only from Saturday till Wednesday . '::::letter
'He never gave us so little of his good company <<target>> he has this summer , ' said Emily .::::as
'You will have them all in the autumn , to comfort you , ' said Claude , 'for he hereby announces <<target>> marvellous fact , that the Marchioness sends him to see if the castle is fit to receive her . '::::the
'Are you sure he is not <<target>> believing what he wishes ? '::::only
' I think he will gain his <<target>> at last , ' said Claude .::::point
'How stupid of him to <<target>> no longer ! '::::stay
' I think he has some scheme for this vacation , ' said Claude , 'and I suppose <<target>> means to crowd all the Beechcroft diversions of a whole summer into those few days . '::::he
'Emily , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I wish him to know <<target>> Carringtons ; invite them and the Westons to dinner on Tuesday . '::::the
'It will be so jolly to have him to take wasps ' <<target>> ; and may I go out rabbit-shooting with him ? '::::nests
'And may I carry <<target>> gun ? '::::a
'Indeed , I would do no <<target>> , ' said Reginald .::::mischief
Lilias was rather disappointed in her hopes that <<target>> Weston and Claude would become better acquainted .::::miss
At dinner the conversation was almost entirely between the elder gentlemen ; Claude <<target>> spoke , except when referred to by his father or Mr. Devereux .::::scarcely
Miss Weston never liked to incur the danger of having to repeat her insignificant speeches to a deaf ear , and being interested <<target>> the discussion that was going on , she by no means seconded Lily 's attempt to get up an under-current of talk .::::in
In general , Lily liked to listen to conversation in silence , but she was now in very high spirits , and could not be quiet ; fortunately , she had no interest in the subject the <<target>> were discussing , so that she could not meddle with that , and finding Alethea silent and Claude out of reach , she turned to Reginald , and talked and tittered with him all dinner-time .::::gentlemen
In the drawing-room she had it all her own <<target>> , and talked enough for all the sisters .::::way
'Have you heard that Cousin <<target>> is coming ? '::::rotherwood
'Yes , you said <<target>> before dinner . '::::so
'We hope , ' said Emily , 'that you <<target>> Mr. Weston will dine here on Tuesday .::::and
The Carringtons are coming , <<target>> a few others . '::::and
'Thank you , ' said Alethea ; ' I <<target>> papa will be very glad to come . '::::daresay
'Have you ever <<target>> Rotherwood ? '::::seen
'Never , ' <<target>> the reply .::::was
'Do not expect much , ' said Lily , laughing , though she knew not why ; 'he is a <<target>> little fellow ; no one would suppose him to be twenty , he has such a boyish look .::::very
Then he never <<target>> down -- '::::sits
'Literally , ' persisted Lily ; 'such a <<target>> person you never did see . '::::quick
'Is he at <<target>> ? '::::oxford
it was all papa 's doing <<target>> he was sent to Eton .::::that
Aunt Rotherwood never would have <<target>> with him . '::::parted
'Uncle Rotherwood put him quite in papa 's power ; Aunt Rotherwood wanted to keep him at home with a tutor , and what she would have made of him I can not think , ' said Lily ; and regardless <<target>> Emily 's warning frowns , and Alethea 's attempt to change the subject , she went on : 'When he was quite a child he used to seem a realisation of all the naughty Dicks and Toms in story-books .::::of
Miss Middleton had a perfect horror of his coming here , for he would mind no one , and played tricks <<target>> drew Claude into mischief ; but he is quite altered since papa had the management of him -- Oh !::::and
such talks as papa has had with Aunt Rotherwood -- do you know , papa says no one knows what it is <<target>> lose a father but those who have the care of his children , and Aunt Rotherwood is so provoking . '::::to
Here Alethea determined to put an end to this oration , and to Emily 's great relief , she cut short the detail of Lady <<target>> 's offences by saying , 'Do you think Faith Longley likely to suit us , if we took her to help the housemaid ? '::::rotherwood
'Are you thinking of <<target>> her ? '::::taking
As Alethea said , laughing , ' I must confess my respect <<target>> that quality , ' Mr. Devereux and Claude entered the room .::::for
Weston is going to take Faith <<target>> to help the housemaid . '::::longley
' I should be very glad , ' said Mr. Devereux , 'that Faith should have a good place ; the Longleys are very <<target>> people , and they behaved particularly well in refusing to let this girl go and live with some dissenters at Stoney Bridge . '::::respectable
' I like what I have seen of the <<target>> very much , ' said Miss Weston .::::girl
'In spite of her sad want of feeling , ' <<target>> Robert , smiling , as he looked at Lily .::::said
she is a good work-a-day sort of person , ' said <<target>> , 'like all other poor people , hard and passive .::::lily
Now , do not set up your eyebrows , Claude , I <<target>> quite serious , there is no warmth about any except -- '::::am
'So this is what Lily <<target>> come to ! '::::is
cried Emily ; 'the grand supporter of <<target>> poor on poetical principles . '::::the
'The poor not <<target>> ! '::::affectionate
'Not , compared within people whose minds and <<target>> have been cultivated , ' said Lily .::::affections
'Now just hear what Mrs. Wall said to me only yesterday ; she asked for a black stuff gown out of the clothing club , `` for , '' said she , `` I had a <<target>> , Miss ; '' I thought it would be , `` and tore my gown , '' but it was , `` I had a misfortune , Miss , and lost my brother . '' '::::misfortune
' A very harsh conclusion on very <<target>> grounds , ' said Mr. Devereux .::::slight
'Facts would scarcely demonstrate it either <<target>> , ' said Mr. Devereux .::::way
'They would only prove what was the case with individuals who chanced to come in our way , and if we are seldom able to judge <<target>> the depth of feeling of those with whom we are familiar , how much less of those who feel our presence a restraint . '::::of
'Besides , you talk <<target>> cultivating the affections .::::of
Now what do <<target>> mean ?::::you
Exercising them , or <<target>> about them ? '::::talking
said Emily , 'the affection of a poor person is more tried ; we blame a poor man for letting his old mother go <<target>> the workhouse , without considering how many of us would do the same , if we had as little to live upon . '::::to
'Still , ' said Alethea , 'the same man who would refuse to maintain <<target>> if poor , would not bear with her infirmities if rich . '::::her
'Are the poor never <<target>> and peevish ? '::::infirm
how much worse it must be to bear with ill-temper in poverty , ' said Emily , 'when we think it quite wonderful to see a young lady kind and patient with a cross old relation ; what must it be when she is denying herself , not <<target>> her pleasure , but her food for her sake ; not merely sitting quietly with her all day , and calling a servant to wait upon her , but toiling all day to maintain her , and keeping awake half the night to nurse her ? '::::only
'Those are realities , indeed , ' said Alethea ; 'our <<target>> efforts seem but child 's play in comparison . '::::greatest
Lilias could hardly have helped being sobered by this conversation if she had attended <<target>> it , but she had turned away to repeat the story of Mrs .::::to
Walls to Jane , and then , fancying that the others were still remarking upon it , <<target>> said in a light , laughing tone , 'Well , so far I agree with you .::::she
I know of a person who may well be called one of <<target>> , who I could quite fancy making such a speech . '::::ourselves
'Whom do you <<target>> ? '::::mean
Alethea wished she <<target>> not know .::::did
'Lilias , ' said Miss Weston , somewhat abruptly , 'did <<target>> not wish to sing with me this evening ? '::::you
And thus she kept Lilias from <<target>> further public mischief that evening .::::any
Claude , exceedingly vexed by what had passed , with great injustice , laid the blame upon Miss Weston , and instead of rendering her the honour which she really deserved for the tact <<target>> which she had put an end to the embarrassment of all parties , he fancied she was anxious to display her talents for music , and thus only felt fretted by the sounds .::::with
Mr. Weston and his daughter intended to walk home that <<target>> , as it was a beautiful moonlight night .::::evening
'Oh , let us <<target>> you ! '::::convoy
exclaimed Lilias ; ' I do <<target>> to show Alethea a glow-worm .::::long
Feel how still and <<target>> it is .::::warm
A perfect summer night , <<target>> a breath stirring . '::::not
Mr. Mohun consented , and Lily almost hurried Alethea <<target>> , to put on her bonnet and shawl .::::upstairs
When she came down she found <<target>> the walking party had increased .::::that
Jane and Reginald would both have been in despair to have missed such a frolic ; Maurice hoped to fall in with the droning beetle , or to lay violent hands <<target>> a glow-worm ; Emily did not like to be left behind , and even Mr. Mohun was going , being in the midst of an interesting conversation with Mr. Weston .::::on
Lily , with an absurd tragic gesture , told Alethea that amongst so many , <<target>> a crowd , all the grace and sweet influence of the walk was ruined .::::such
The 'sweet influence ' was ruined as far as Lily was <<target>> , but not by the number of her companions .::::concerned
It was the uneasy feeling caused by her over-strained spirits and foolish chattering that prevented her from really entering into the charm of the soft air , the clear moon , <<target>> solemn deep blue sky , the few stars , the white lilies on the dark pond , the long shadows of the trees , the freshness of the dewy fields .::::the
When the last good-night had been exchanged , and Lily had turned homeward , she felt the stillness which succeeded their farewells almost oppressive ; she started at the dark shadow of a tree which lay across the path , <<target>> to shake off a sensation of fear which was coming over her , she put her arm within Claude 's , exclaiming , 'You naughty boy , you will be stupid and silent , say what I will . '::::and
' I heard enough to-night to strike <<target>> dumb , ' said Claude .::::me
For one moment Lily thought he was in jest , but the gravity of his manner showed her <<target>> he was both grieved and displeased , and she changed her tone as she said , 'Oh !::::that
Claude , what do <<target>> mean ? '::::you
'Do you not <<target>> ? '::::know
'What , you mean <<target>> Eleanor ? '::::about
said Lily ; 'you must fall upon Miss <<target>> there -- it was her doing . '::::jenny
'Jane 's tongue is a pest , ' said Claude ; 'but she was <<target>> the first to speak evil falsely of one to whom you owe everything .::::not
Lily , I can not tell you <<target>> that allusion of yours sounded . '::::how
asked Lily in alarm , for she had <<target>> seen her gentle brother so angry .::::never
'Claude , Claude , you must mistake , I <<target>> could have said anything so very shocking . '::::never
' I hope I do , ' said Claude ; ' I could hardly believe that one of the little <<target>> who can not remember him , could have referred to him in that way -- but for you ! '::::ones
' I do not like to mention his name to <<target>> who regards him so lightly , ' said Claude .::::one
'Think over what passed , if you are <<target>> come to yourself to remember it . '::::sufficiently
After a little pause Lily said in a subdued voice , 'Claude , I hope you <<target>> not believe that I was thinking of what really happened when I said that . '::::do
'Pray what were you <<target>> of ? '::::thinking
'The abstract view of <<target>> 's character . '::::eleanor
' A fine demonstration of the rule of love , <<target>> go about the world slandering your sister ! '::::to
'To go about <<target>> world !::::the
I always rejoiced that you had no foolish young <<target>> friend to make missish confidences to . '::::lady
'She is no foolish young lady friend , ' said Lilias , indignant in her turn ; 'she <<target>> five years older than I am , and papa wishes us to be intimate with her . '::::is
'Then the fault is in <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::yourself
'You ought not to have told such things if <<target>> were true , and being utterly false -- '::::they
'But , Claude , I can not <<target>> that they are false . '::::see
'Not false , that Eleanor cared <<target>> a farthing for Harry ! '::::not
Claude , how could <<target>> think that ?::::you
I told you I did not mean what really happened , only that -- Eleanor is cold -- not as warm as some people -- she did care for him , of course she did -- I know that -- I <<target>> she loved him with all her heart -- but yet -- I mean she did not -- she went on as usual -- said nothing -- scarcely cried -- looked the same -- taught us -- never -- Oh !::::believe
it did not make half the difference in <<target>> that it did in William . '::::her
' I can not tell how she behaved at the time , ' said Claude , ' I only <<target>> I never had any idea what a loss Harry was till I came home and saw her face .::::know
I used never to trouble myself to think whether people looked ill <<target>> well , but the change in her did strike me .::::or
She was bearing up to comfort papa , and to cheer William , and to do her duty <<target>> all of us , and you could take such noble resignation for want of feeling ! '::::by
At last she said in a voice broken by sobs , ' I was unjust -- I know Eleanor was all kindness -- all self-sacrifice -- I have been very ungrateful -- I wish I could help it -- and you know well , Claude , how far <<target>> am from regarding dear Harry with indifference -- how the thought of him is a star in my mind -- how happy it makes me to think of him at the end of the Church Militant Prayer ; do not believe I was dreaming of him . '::::i
It was nonsense -- I <<target>> nothing worse . '::::hope
Lily felt that she might <<target>> his arm again .::::take
'Eleanor knew Harry better than you did ; no , Lily , I never could have been what Harry was , <<target>> if I had never wasted my time , and if my headaches had not interfered with my best efforts . '::::even
' I do not believe that , say <<target>> you will , ' said Lily .::::what
' I am sure papa does not think so , ' said Lily ; 'no , <<target>> can not feel that Harry is such a loss when we still have you . '::::i
Lily , it is plain that you <<target>> knew Harry , ' said Claude .::::never
' I do not believe you ever did -- that <<target>> one ting to be said for you . '::::is
Then think how little we saw of him whilst they were abroad ; he was always at school , or spending the holidays <<target>> Aunt Robert , and latterly even farther off , and only coming sometimes for an hour or two to see us .::::with
Then he used to kiss us all round , we went into the garden with him , looked at him , and were rather <<target>> of him ; then he walked off to Wat Greenwood , came back , wished us good-bye , and away he went . '::::afraid
'Then he was a tall youth , and we were silly girls , ' <<target>> Lilias ; 'he avoided Miss Middleton , and we were always with her .::::said
He was good- natured , but he could not get on with us ; he <<target>> very well with the little ones , but we were of the wrong age .::::did
said Claude ; ' I never heard a laugh so full <<target>> glee , except , perhaps , Phyllis 's . '::::of
'The last time he was at home , ' continued Lily , 'we began to know him better ; there was no Miss Middleton <<target>> the way , and after you and William were gone , he used to walk with us , and read to us .::::in
He read Guy Mannering to us , and told us the story of Sir Maurice de Mohun ; but the loss was not the same to us as <<target>> you elder ones ; and then sorrow was almost lost in admiration , and in pleasure at the terms in which every one spoke of him .::::to
Claude , I have no difficulty in not wishing it otherwise ; he is still my brother , and I would not <<target>> the feeling which the thought of his death gives me -- no , not for himself in life and health . '::::change
sighed Claude , 'you have no cause for self-reproach -- no reason <<target>> lament over `` wasted hours and love misspent . '' '::::to
'You will always talk of your old indolence , as <<target>> it was a great crime , ' said Lily .::::if
'As long as we know we are out of the path of duty it does not <<target>> much difference whether we have turned to the right hand or to the left . '::::make
'Was it Harry 's death that made you <<target>> upon it in this light ? '::::look
Indeed , till I came home , and saw this place without <<target>> , I never really knew what a loss he was .::::him
Thoughts of Harry and of my father came afterwards ; <<target>> had not vigour enough for them before . '::::i
Here they reached the house , and parted -- Claude , ashamed of having talked of himself for the first time in <<target>> life , and Lily divided between shame at her own folly and pleasure at Claude 's having thus opened his mind .::::his
Jane , who was most <<target>> fault , escaped censure .::::in
Her father was ignorant <<target>> her improper speech .::::of
Emily forgot it , and it was not Claude 's place to <<target>> his sisters , though to Lily he spoke as a friend .::::reprove
It passed away from her mind like other idle words , which , <<target>> , could not but leave an impression on those who heard her .::::however
An unlooked-for result of the folly of this evening was , that Claude was prevented from appreciating Miss Weston He could not learn to like her , nor shake off an idea , that <<target>> was prying into their family concerns ; he thought her over-praised , and would not even give just admiration to her singing , because he had once fancied her eager to exhibit it .::::she
It was unreasonable to dislike his sister 's friend for his sister 's folly , but Claude 's wisdom <<target>> not yet arrived at its full growth , and he deserved credit for keeping his opinion to himself .::::was
'Whom He hath blessed and called His own , He tries them early , look <<target>> tone , Bent brow and throbbing heart , Tries them with pain . '::::and
The next week Lily had the pleasure of fitting out <<target>> Longley for her place at Mrs. Weston 's .::::faith
She rejoiced at this opportunity of patronising her , because in her secret soul she felt that <<target>> might have done her a little injustice in choosing her own favourite Esther in her stead .::::she
Esther 's popularity at the New Court , however , made Lilias confident in her own judgment ; the servants liked her because she was quick and obliging , Mr. Mohun said she looked very neat , Phyllis liked her because a mischance to her frock was not so brave an offence <<target>> her as with Rachel , and Ada was growing very fond of her , because she was in the habit of bestowing great admiration on her golden curls as she arranged them , and both little girls were glad not to be compelled to put away the playthings they took out .::::with
Lord Rotherwood was as ardent in the cause as even Reginald could desire , and <<target>> have instantly set out with him to reconnoitre had not the evening been rainy .::::would

'It is too much trouble , I perceive , ' <<target>> Lord Rotherwood ; 'just as I told you . '::::said
Lord Rotherwood now detailed his plan to his uncle , who said with a <<target>> smile , 'Well , Claude , what do you think of it ?::::propitious
'Mind you catch a firefly for <<target>> , ' said Maurice .::::me
'Why do n't you <<target>> , Claude ? '::::answer
said Lilias ; 'only imagine <<target>> Undine 's Castle ! '::::seeing
'It would be very pleasant , ' <<target>> Claude , slowly , 'but -- '::::said
' I hope he will have disposed of it by the morning ; I start next Tuesday week ; I would not go later <<target>> the universe ; we shall be just in time for the summer in its beauty , and to have a peep at Switzerland .::::for
We shall not have time for Mont Blanc , without <<target>> faster than any man in his senses would do .::::rattling
I do not mean to leave any place till I have <<target>> seen twice over everything worth seeing that it contains . '::::thoroughly
'Then perhaps you will get as far as Antwerp , and spend the <<target>> of the holidays between the Cathedral and Paul Potter 's bull .::::rest
No , I shall have nothing to say to <<target>> at that rate , ' said Claude .::::you
'Depend upon it , it will be you that will wish to stand still <<target>> I had rather be on the move , ' said the Marquis .::::when
'Then you had better <<target>> me behind .::::leave
I have no intention of being hurried over the world , and never <<target>> my own way , ' said Claude , trying to look surly .::::having
' I am sure I should not mind travelling twice over the world to <<target>> Cologne Cathedral , or the field of Waterloo , ' said Lily .::::see
'Let me only show him my <<target>> , ' said Lord Rotherwood .::::route
'Redgie , look in my greatcoat pocket in the <<target>> for Murray 's Handbook , will you ? '::::hall
'Go and get it , Phyl , ' said Reginald , <<target>> was astride on the window- sill , peeling a stick .::::who
Away darted Lord Rotherwood to fetch it himself , but Phyllis was before him ; her merry laugh was heard , as he <<target>> her round the hall to get possession of his book , throwing down two or three cloaks to intercept her path .::::chased
Mr. Mohun took the opportunity of his absence to tell Claude <<target>> he need not refuse on the score of expense .::::that
'Thank you , ' was <<target>> Claude 's answer .::::all
Lord Rotherwood returned , and after punishing the discourteous Reginald by raising him up by his ears , he proceeded to give a full description of the delights of his <<target>> , the girls joining heartily with him in declaring it as well arranged as possible , and bringing all their knowledge of German travels to bear upon it .::::expedition
Claude sometimes put in a word , but never as if he cared much about the matter , and <<target>> was not to be persuaded to give any decided answer as to whether he would accompany the Marquis .::::he
The next morning at breakfast Lord Rotherwood returned to the charge , <<target>> Claude seemed even more inclined to refuse than the day before .::::but
Lilias could not divine what was the matter with him , and lingered long after her sisters had gone to school , to hear what answer he would make ; and when Mr. Mohun looked at his watch , and asked <<target>> if she knew how late it was , she rose from the breakfast-table with a sigh , and thought while she was putting on her bonnet how much less agreeable the school had been since the schism in the parish .::::her
And besides , now that Faith and Esther , and one or two others of her best scholars , had gone away from school , there seemed to be no one of any intelligence <<target>> knowledge left in the class , except Marianne Weston , who knew too much for the others , and one or two clever inattentive little girls : Lily almost disliked teaching them .::::or
Phyllis never dreamt that she could be happy while standing still and <<target>> , till Miss Weston began to teach at the Sunday school .::::learning
Obedience at school taught her to acquire habits of reverent attention , which <<target>> conquered the idleness and weariness which had once possessed her at church .::::gradually
First , she learnt to be interested in the Historical Lessons , then never to lose her place in the Psalms , then to think about and follow some of the Prayers ; by this time she was far from feeling any fatigue at all on week-days ; she had succeeded in restraining any <<target>> to relieve herself from the irksomeness of sitting still , and had her thoughts in tolerable order through the greater part of the Sunday service , and now it was her great wish , unknown to any one , to abstain from a single yawn through the whole service , including the sermon !::::contortions
Her place ( chosen for her by Eleanor when first she had begun to go to Church , as far <<target>> possible from Reginald ) was at the end of the seat , between her papa and the wall .::::as
This morning , as she put her arm on the book-board , while rising from kneeling , she felt a sudden thrill of sharp pain <<target>> her left elbow , which made her start violently , and would have caused a scream , had she not been in church .::::smear
She saw a wasp fall on the ground , and was just about <<target>> put her foot on it , when she recollected where she was .::::to
She had never in her life intentionally killed anything , and this was <<target>> time to begin in that place , and when she was angry .::::no
The pain was severe -- more so perhaps than any she had felt before -- <<target>> very much frightened , she pulled her papa 's coat to draw his attention .::::and
But her first pull was so slight that he did not feel it , and before she gave a second <<target>> remembered that she could not make him hear what was the matter , without more noise than was proper .::::she
She proceeded to find out the Psalm and join her voice with the others , though her heart was beating very fast , her forehead was <<target>> , and she could not help keeping her right hand clasped round her arm , and sometimes shifting from one foot to the other .::::contracted
The sharpness of the pain soon went off ; she was able to attend to the Lessons , and hoped it would soon be quite well ; <<target>> as soon as she began to think about it , it began to ache and throb , and seemed each moment to be growing hotter .::::but
The sermon especially tried her patience , her cheeks were burning , she felt sick and hardly able to hold up her <<target>> , yet she would not lean it against the wall , because she had often been told not to do so .::::head
She was exceedingly alarmed to find that her arm had swelled so much that she could hardly bend it , and it had received the impression of the gathers of her sleeve ; she thought no sermon had ever <<target>> so long , but she sat quite still and upright , as she could not have done , had she not trained herself unconsciously by her efforts to leave off the trick of kicking her heels together .::::been
'My poor child , it is frightful , ' <<target>> Emily , 'what is the matter ? '::::said
'What is the <<target>> ? '::::matter
'Papa , just look , ' said Emily , ' a wasp stung this dear child quite <<target>> in the service , and she has been bearing it all this time in silence .::::early
Why did you not show <<target>> , Phyl ? '::::me
'Why , Phyllis , you are a <<target>> Spartan , ' said Lord Rotherwood .::::very
'Does it give you much pain <<target>> , my dear ? '::::now
'Not so bad as in church , ' said Phyllis , 'only <<target>> am very tired , and it is so hot . '::::i
'We will help you home , <<target>> , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::then
As he took her up in his arms , Phyllis laughed , thanked him , replied to various inquiries from her sisters and the Westons -- laughed again at sundry <<target>> from her brothers , then became silent , and was almost asleep , with her head on her papa 's shoulder , by the time they reached the hall-door .::::jokes
She thought it very strange to be laid down on the sofa <<target>> the drawing-room , and to find every one attending to her .::::in
Mrs. Weston bathed her forehead with lavender-water , and Lily cut open the sleeve of <<target>> frock ; Jane fetched all manner of remedies , and Emily pitied her .::::her
She was rather frightened : she thought such a fuss would not be made about her unless she was very ill ; she was faint <<target>> tired , and was glad when Mrs. Weston proposed that they should all come away , and leave her to go to sleep quietly .::::and
Marianne was so absorbed in admiration of Phyllis that she did not speak one word all the way from church to the <<target>> Court , and stood in silence watching the operations upon her friend , till Mrs. Weston sent every one away .::::new
Phyllis was waked by the bells ringing for the afternoon service ; Mrs. Weston was sitting by her , reading , Claude came to inquire for <<target>> , and to tell her that as she had lost her early dinner , she was to join the rest of the party at six .::::her
To her great surprise she felt quite well and fresh , and her arm was much better ; Mrs. Weston pinned up her sleeve , <<target>> she set off with her to church , wondering whether Ada would remember to tell her what she had missed that afternoon at school .::::and
Those whose approbation was valuable , honoured Phyllis for her conduct , but she did not perceive it , or seek for it ; she did not look like a heroine while running about and playing <<target>> Reginald and the dogs in the evening , but her papa had told her she was a good child , Claude had given her one of his kindest smiles , and she was happy .::::with
'We care not who says And intends it dispraise , <<target>> an Angler to a fool is next neighbour . '::::that
In the evening Lord Rotherwood renewed his entreaties <<target>> Claude to join him on his travels .::::to
He was very much bent on taking him , for his <<target>> pleasure depended not a little on his cousin 's company .::::own
Claude lay on the glassy slope of the terrace , while Lord Rotherwood paced rapidly up and down before <<target>> , persuading him with all the allurements he could think of , and looking the picture of impatience .::::him
Lily sat by , adding her <<target>> to all his arguments .::::weight
But Claude was almost contemptuous to all the beauties of Germany , and all the promised sights ; he scarcely gave himself the trouble to answer his tormentors , only vouchsafing sometimes to open his lips to say that he never meant to go to a country where people spoke a language that sounded like cracking walnuts ; that he hated steamers ; <<target>> no fancy for tumble-down castles ; that it was so common to travel ; there was more distinction in staying at home ; that the field of Waterloo had been spoilt , and was not worth seeing ; his ideas of glaciers would be ruined by the reality ; and he did not care to see Cologne Cathedral till it was finished .::::had
On this Lily set up <<target>> outcry of horror .::::an
'One comfort is , Lily , ' said Lord Rotherwood , 'he does not <<target>> it ; he did not say it from the bottom of his heart .::::mean
Now , confess you did <<target>> , Claude . '::::not
Claude pretended to <<target>> asleep .::::be
' I see plainly enough , ' said the Marquis to Lily , 'it <<target>> as Wat Greenwood says , `` Mr. Reynold and the grapes . '' '::::is
'But it is not , ' said Lily , 'and that is what provokes me ; papa says he is quite welcome to go if he likes , and that he thinks <<target>> will do him a great deal of good , but that foolish boy will say nothing but `` I will think about it , '' and `` thank you '' '::::it
'Then I give him up <<target>> regularly dense . '::::as
'It is the most delightful plan ever thought of , ' said Lily , 'so easily <<target>> , and just bringing within his compass all he ever wished to see . '::::done
his sole ambition is to stretch those long legs of his on the <<target>> , like a great vegetable marrow , ' said Lord Rotherwood .::::grass
'It is vegetating like a plant that makes him so much <<target>> than any rational creature with a little animal life . '::::taller
' I think Jane has his share of curiosity , ' said Lily , ' I <<target>> sure I had no idea that anything belonging to us could be so stupid . '::::am

'Very much obliged to you they would be <<target>> the suggestion , ' said Claude .::::for

I undertook them these holidays , and <<target>> mean to keep them . '::::i
Lilias was just flying off to her father , when Claude caught hold of her , saying , ' <<target>> desire you will not , ' and she stood still , looking at her cousin in dismay .::::i
I thought you would not go a week later <<target>> the universe , ' said Claude , smiling .::::for
'None whatever ; I meant to spend three weeks with my mother at <<target>> end of the tour , and I shall spend them now instead .::::the
I only talked of going immediately , because nothing is done at all that is not done quickly , and <<target>> hate delays , but it is all the same , and now it stands for Tuesday three weeks .::::i
Now we shall see what he <<target>> to Cologne , Lily . '::::says
Claude sprung up , and began talking over arrangements and possibilities with <<target>> , which showed what his wishes had been from the first .::::zest
All was quickly settled , and as soon as his father had given his cordial approbation to the scheme , it was amusing <<target>> see how animated and active Claude became , and in how different a style he talked of the once slighted Rhine .::::to
Lord Rotherwood told the boys that their brother was a great deal too good for them , but they never troubled themselves to ask in what respect ; Lilias took very great delight in telling Emily of the sacrifice which he had been <<target>> to make , and looked forward to talking it over with Alethea , but she refrained , as long as he was at home , as she knew it would greatly displease him , and she had heard enough about missish confidences .::::willing
The Marquis of Rotherwood was certainly the very reverse of <<target>> chosen travelling companion , in the matter of activity .::::his
Reginald was making contrivances for tying a string round his wrist and hanging the end of it from the window , that Andrew Grey <<target>> give it a pull as he went by to his work , to wake him , when Lord Rotherwood exclaimed , 'What !::::might

'No , ' said Reginald , ' I <<target>> heard of any one that could . '::::never
'Then I advise you to learn the art ; <<target>> the meantime I will call you to-morrow . '::::in
Loud voices and laughter in the hall , and the front door creaking on its hinges at sunrise , convinced the <<target>> that this was no vain boast ; before breakfast was quite over the fishermen were seen approaching the house .::::household
Maurice displayed to Jane the contents of two phials , strange little creatures , with stranger <<target>> , of which he was as proud as Reginald of his three fine trout .::::names
Lord Rotherwood did not appear till he had made himself look like <<target>> people , which he did in a surprisingly short time .::::other
He began estimating the weight of the fish , and talking at his most rapid rate , till at last Claude said , 'Phyllis told us just <<target>> that you were coming back , for that she heard Cousin Rotherwood talking , and it proved to be Jane 's old turkey cock gobbling . '::::now

'And he cut it out with his knife , and caught <<target>> great trout with it directly , ' said Reginald .::::that
'And neither half drowned Maurice , <<target>> sent him home again ? '::::nor
' I contented myself with taking away his weapon , ' said the Marquis ; 'and he wished for nothing better than <<target>> poke about in the gutters for insects ; it was only Redgie that teased him into the nobler sport . '::::to
He and Claude set out as soon as breakfast was over , and came back about three o'clock ; Claude was tired with the heat , and betook himself to the <<target>> , where he fell asleep , under pretence of reading , but the indefatigable Marquis was ready and willing to set out with Reginald and Wat Greenwood to shoot rabbits .::::sofa
Dinner-time came , and Emily sat at the drawing-room window with <<target>> and Lilias , lamenting her cousin 's bad habits .::::claude
'Nothing will ever make him <<target>> , ' said she .::::punctual
' I am in duty bound to let you <<target>> nothing against him , ' said Claude .::::say
'It is very good-natured in him to wait for you , ' said <<target>> , 'but it would be horribly selfish to leave you behind . '::::lily

Lord Rotherwood came in , accounting for being late , as , in <<target>> through a harvest field , he could not help attempting to reap .::::passing
The Beechcroft farming operations had been his especial amusement from very early days , and his plans <<target>> numerous for farming on a grand scale as soon as he should be of age .::::were
He said it was very forlorn ; the rooms looked so dreary and deserted that he could <<target>> bear to be in them , and had been out of doors almost all the time .::::not
Indeed , he was afraid he had disappointed the housekeeper by not complimenting her <<target>> she deserved , for the freezing dismal order in which she kept everything .::::as
'And really , ' said he , ' I must go again to-morrow and make up for it , and Emily , you must come <<target>> me and try to devise something to make the unhappy place less like the abode of the Prince of the Black Islands . '::::with
Emily willingly promised to go , and she went on talking to him , and telling him whom he was to meet <<target>> the next day , when an unusual silence making her look up , she beheld him more than half asleep .::::on
Reginald fidgeted and sighed , and Maurice grew graver <<target>> graver as they thought of the wasps .::::and
Maurice wanted to take a nest entire , <<target>> began explaining his plan to Claude .::::and
'You see , Claude , burning some straw and then digging , spoils the combs , as Wat does it ; now I have got some puff-balls and sulphur to put <<target>> the hole , and set fire to them with a lucifer match , so as to stifle the wasps , and then dig them out quietly to-morrow morning . '::::into
'It is all of no use , if that Rotherwood will do <<target>> but sleep , ' said Reginald , in a disconsolate tone .::::nothing

I thought you were going to <<target>> wasps ' nests . '::::take
'You are much too tired , I <<target>> sure , ' said Emily .::::am
not in the least , I have done nothing to-day to tire me , ' <<target>> Lord Rotherwood , walking up and down the room to keep himself awake .::::said
The whole party went out , and found Wat Greenwood waiting for them <<target>> a bundle of straw , a spade , and a little gunpowder .::::with
Maurice carried a basket containing all his preparations , on which Wat looked with supreme <<target>> , telling him that his puffs were too green to make a smeech .::::contempt
Maurice , not condescending to argue the point , ran on to a nest <<target>> Reginald had marked on one of the green banks of the ancient moat .::::which
'Take care that the wasps are all come in ; mind <<target>> you are about , Maurice , ' called his father .::::what
'Master Maurice , ' shouted Wat , 'you <<target>> better take a green bough . '::::had
'Never mind , Wat , ' said Lord Rotherwood , 'he would <<target>> stay long enough to use it if he had it . '::::not
Reginald ran after Maurice , who <<target>> just reached the nest .::::had
'There is one coming in , the evening is <<target>> warm they are not quiet yet . '::::so
' I 'll quiet them , ' said Maurice , kneeling <<target>> , and putting his first puff-ball into the hole .::::down
Reginald stood by with a sly smile , as <<target>> pulled a branch off a neighbouring filbert-tree .::::he
The next moment Maurice gave a <<target>> yell , 'The wasps !::::sudden
and jumping up , and tripping at his first step , rolled <<target>> the bank , and landed safely at Lord Rotherwood 's feet .::::down
The shouts of laughter were loud , but he regarded them not , and as soon as he <<target>> his feet , rushed past his sisters , and never stopped till he reached the house .::::recovered
Redgie stood alone , in the midst of a cloud of wasps , beating them off with <<target>> bough , roaring with laughter , and calling Wat to bring the straw to burn them .::::a
'No , no , Redgie , come away , leave them <<target>> Maurice to try again , ' said his father .::::for

After a few more nests had been taken in <<target>> usual manner , they returned to the house .::::the

The next day was <<target>> rather more rationally .::::spent
Lord Rotherwood met with a book of Irish Tales , with which he became so engrossed that he did <<target>> like to leave it when Emily and Claude were ready to ride to Devereux Castle with him .::::not
When there he was equally eager and vehement about each matter that came under consideration , and so many presented themselves , <<target>> Emily began to be in agonies lest she should not be at home in time to dress and receive her guests .::::that
They did , however , reach the house before Lilias , who had been walking with Miss Weston , came in , and when she went upstairs , she found Emily full of complaints at the inconvenience of having no Rachel to assist her in dressing , and to see that everything was in <<target>> , and that Phyllis was fit to appear when she came down in the evening ; but , by the assistance of Lily and Jane , she got over her troubles , and when she went into the drawing-room , she was much relieved to find her two gentlemen quite safe and dressed .::::order
She had been in great fear of Lord Rotherwood 's straying away to join in some of <<target>> 's sports , and was grateful to the Irish book for keeping him out of mischief .::::reginald
Emily was in her glory ; it was the first large dinner-party since Eleanor had gone , and though she pitied herself for having the trouble of entertaining the people , she really <<target>> the feeling that she now appeared as the mistress of New Court , with her cousin , the Marquis , by her side , to show how highly she was connected .::::enjoyed
And everything went off just <<target>> could be wished .::::as
Lord Rotherwood talked intelligibly and sensibly , and Mr. Mohun 's <<target>> at dinner had a voice which he could hear .::::neighbour
Lily 's pleasure was not less than her <<target>> 's , though of a different kind .::::sister
She delighted in thinking how well Emily did the honours , in watching the varied expression of Lord Rotherwood 's animated countenance , in imagining Claude 's forehead <<target>> be finer than that of any one else , and in thinking how people must admire Reginald 's tall , active figure , and very handsome face .::::to
She was asked to play , and did tolerably well , but was <<target>> shy to sing , nor , indeed , was Reginald encouraging .::::too
'What is the use of <<target>> singing , Lily ?::::your
If it was like Miss <<target>> 's , now -- '::::weston
Reginald had taken a great fancy to Miss Weston ; he stood by her all the evening , and afterwards let her talk to him , and then began <<target>> chatter himself , at last becoming so confidential as to impart to her the grand object of his ambition , which was to be taller than Claude !::::to
The next morning Lord Rotherwood left Beechcroft , somewhat to Emily 's relief ; for though she was very proud of him , and much enjoyed the dignity of being seen to talk familiarly with him , yet , when <<target>> strangers were present , and he became no more than an ordinary cousin , she was worried by his incessant activity , and desire to see , know , and do everything as fast and as thoroughly as possible .::::no
She could not see the use of such vehemence ; she liked to take things in a <<target>> way , and as Claude said , much preferred the passive to the active voice .::::moderate
Claude , on the contrary , was ashamed of his constitutional indolence , looked on it as a temptation , and struggled against it , almost envying his <<target>> his unabated eagerness and untiring energy , and liking to be with him , because no one else so effectually roused him from his habitual languor .::::cousin
His indolence was , however , so much the effect of ill health , that exertion was sometimes scarcely in his power , especially in hot weather , <<target>> by the time his brothers ' studies were finished each day , he was unfit for anything but to lie on the grass under the plane-tree .::::and
At the same time , Reginald 's devotion to Miss Weston increased ; he never moved from her side when she sang , did not fail to be of the <<target>> when she walked with his sisters , offered her one of his own puppies , named his little ship 'Alethea , ' and was even tolerably civil to Marianne .::::party
At length the day of departure came ; the boys returned to school , Claude <<target>> Lord Rotherwood , and the New Court was again in a state of tranquillity .::::joined
'Prescribe us not <<target>> duties . '::::our
'Well , Phyllis , ' said her father , as he passed through the hall to mount <<target>> horse , 'how do you like the prospect of Monsieur le Roi 's instructions ? '::::his
'Not at all , papa , ' answered Phyllis , running out to the <<target>> door to pat the horse , and give it a piece of bread .::::hall
'Take care you turn out your <<target>> , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::toes
'You must learn to dance like a dragon <<target>> Cousin Rotherwood 's birthday next year . '::::before
'Papa , how do <<target>> dance ? '::::dragons
'That is a question I must decide at my <<target>> , ' said Mr. Mohun , mounting .::::leisure
'Stand out of the way , Phyl , <<target>> you will feel how horses dance . '::::or
Away he rode , while Phyllis turned with unwilling steps to the nursery , to be dressed for her first dancing lesson ; Marianne Weston was to <<target>> with her , and this was some consolation , but Phyllis could not share in the satisfaction Adeline felt in the arrival of Monsieur le Roi .::::learn
Jane was also a pupil , but Lily , whose recollections of her own dancing days were not <<target>> , absented herself entirely from the dancing-room , even though Alethea Weston had come with her sister .::::agreeable
Poor Phyllis danced as awkwardly as was expected , but Adeline seemed likely to be a pupil in whom a master might rejoice ; Marianne was very attentive and not ungraceful , but Alethea soon saw reason to regret the <<target>> that had been made , for she perceived that Jane considered the master a fair subject for derision , and her 'nods and becks , and wreathed smiles , ' called up corresponding looks in Marianne 's face .::::arrangement
'Oh Brownie , you are <<target>> naughty thing ! '::::a
'He really was <<target>> ! '::::irresistible
' I suppose ridicule is one of the disagreeables to which <<target>> dancing- master makes up his mind , ' said Alethea .::::a
'Yes , ' said Jane , 'one can <<target>> no compunction in quizzing that species . '::::have
' I do not think I can quite say <<target>> , Jane , ' said Miss Weston .::::that
'This man especially lays himself open to ridicule , ' said Jane ; 'do you know , Alethea , that he is <<target>> Englishman , and his name is King , only he calls himself Le Roi , and speaks broken English ! '::::an
Though Alethea joined in the general laugh , she did not feel quite satisfied ; she feared that if not checked in time , Jane would proceed to actual impertinence , and that Marianne would <<target>> tempted to follow her example , but she did not like to interfere , and only advised Marianne to be on her guard , hoping that Emily would also speak seriously to her sister .::::be
On the next occasion , however , Jane ventured still farther ; her grimaces were almost irresistible , and she had a most comical manner of imitating the <<target>> 's attitudes when his eye was not upon her , and putting on a demure countenance when he turned towards her , which sorely tried Marianne .::::master
said the little girl , as the sisters walked home together ; ' I do <<target>> know how to help laughing , if Jane will be so very funny . '::::not
' I am afraid we must ask mamma to let us give up the dancing , ' replied Alethea ; 'the <<target>> is almost too strong , and I do not think she would wish to expose you to it . '::::temptation
'But , Alethea , why do <<target>> you speak to Jane ? '::::not
asked Marianne ; 'no one seems to tell her it <<target>> wrong ; Miss Mohun was almost laughing . '::::is
' I do not think Jane would consider that I <<target>> to find fault with her , ' said Alethea .::::ought
'But you would not scold her , ' urged Marianne ; 'only put her in mind that it is <<target>> right , not kind ; that Monsieur le Roi is in authority over her for the time . '::::not
And it was better , for Mr. Mohun happening to be at <<target>> , was dragged into the dancing-room by Emily and Ada .::::home
Once , when she thought he was looking another way , Jane tried to raise <<target>> smile , but a stern 'Jane , what are you thinking of ? '::::a
recalled her to order , and when the lesson was over her father spoke gravely to her , telling her that he thought few things more disgusting in <<target>> young lady than impertinence towards her teachers ; and then added , 'Miss Weston , I hope you keep strict watch over these giddy young things . '::::a
Awed by her father , Jane behaved tolerably well at that time and the next , and Miss Weston hoped her interference would <<target>> be needed , but as if to make up for this restraint , her conduct a fortnight after was quite beyond bearing .::::not
She used every means to make Marianne laugh , and at last went so far as to pretend to think <<target>> M. le Roi had not understood what she said in English , and to translate it into French .::::that
When the exercise was over Miss Weston made her a sign to approach , <<target>> said , 'Jane , do you think your papa would have liked -- '::::and
'What do you <<target>> ? '::::mean
said Jane , ' I <<target>> not been laughing . '::::have
'You know what I mean , ' said Alethea , 'and pray do not be displeased <<target>> I ask you not to make it difficult for Marianne to behave properly . '::::if
Jane drew up her head and <<target>> back to her place .::::went
She played no more tricks that day , but as soon as the guests were <<target>> , began telling Lilias how Miss Weston had been meddling and scolding her .::::gone
'And well you must have deserved <<target>> , ' said Lily .::::it
' I do not say that Jenny was right , ' said Emily , 'but I <<target>> Miss Weston might allow me to correct my own sister in my own house . '::::think
cried Lily , <<target>> Jane laughed .::::and
' I only mean , ' said Emily , 'that it was not very polite , and <<target>> says the closest friendship is no reason for dispensing with the rules of politeness . '::::papa
'Certainly not , ' said Lily , 'the rules of politeness are rules of love , and it was in love that Alethea <<target>> ; she sees how sadly we are left to ourselves , and is kind enough to speak a word in season . '::::spoke
'Perhaps , ' said Jane , 'since it was in love that she spoke , you would like to <<target>> her for our reprover for ever , and I can assure you more unlikely things have happened .::::have
I have heard it from <<target>> who can judge . '::::one
'Then , perhaps , you would like <<target>> have Eleanor back again ? '::::to
' I am sure you want some one to put <<target>> in mind of your duty , ' said Lily .::::you
cried Emily ; 'you who thought so <<target>> of the power of love ! '::::much
'Of Emily and love , she would say , <<target>> it sounded well , ' said Jane .::::if
' I can not see what true love you or Jane are showing now , ' said Lily , 'it is <<target>> kindness to encourage her pertness , or to throw away a friendly reproof because it offends your pride . '::::no
'Nobody reproved me , ' replied Emily ; 'besides , I know love will prevail ; <<target>> my sake Jane will not expose herself and me to a stranger 's interference . '::::for
'What a weathercock <<target>> is ! '::::lily
cried Jane , 'she has fallen in love with <<target>> Weston , and echoes all she says . '::::alethea
'That Alethea Weston , ' exclaimed Jane , in an angry tone ; -- but Emily , beginning to recover some sense of propriety , <<target>> , 'Jenny , you know you were very ill-bred , and you made it difficult for the little ones to behave well . '::::said
Jane , ' said Emily , ' I do not like <<target>> hear you talk of confirmation in that light way . '::::to
'No , no , ' said Jane , ' I do not mean it -- of course I do not mean it -- do n't look shocked -- it was only by <<target>> bye -- and another by the bye , Emily , you know I must have a cap and white ribbons , and I am afraid I must make it myself . '::::the
'Ay , that is the worst of having Esther , ' said Emily , 'she and Hannah have no notion of anything but the plainest work ; I am sure <<target>> I had thought of all the trouble of that kind which having a young girl would entail , I would never have consented to Esther 's coming . '::::if
'That was entirely Lily 's <<target>> , ' said Jane .::::scheme
'Yes ; it is impossible to resist Lily , she is so eager and anxious , and it would have vexed her very much if <<target>> had opposed her , and that I can not bear ; besides , Esther is a very nice girl , and will learn . '::::i
If Jane had heard that conversation she might have perceived that she could not wilfully offend , even in what she thought <<target>> trifling matter , without making it evident , even to others , that there was something very wrong about her .::::a
At that moment the Rector was saying to his uncle , ' I am in doubt about Jane , I can not <<target>> fear she is not in a satisfactory state for confirmation , and I wished to ask you what you think ? '::::but
'Act just as you would with any of <<target>> village girls , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::the
' I should be very sorry to do otherwise , ' said Mr. Devereux ; 'but I thought you might like , since every one knows that <<target>> is a candidate , that she should not be at home at the time of the confirmation , if it is necessary to refuse her . '::::she
'No , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I <<target>> not wish to shield her from the disgrace .::::should
I have not been satisfied with all I saw of little Jane for some time past , <<target>> I am afraid that much passes amongst my poor girls which never comes to my knowledge .::::and
Her pertness especially is probably <<target>> in my presence . '::::restrained
'It is not so much the pertness that I complain of , ' said Mr. Devereux , 'for that might be merely exuberance of <<target>> , but there is a sort of habitual irreverence , which makes one dread to bring her nearer to sacred tings . '::::spirits
' I know what you mean , ' said Mr. Mohun , 'and I think the <<target>> is a branch of it , more noticed because more inconvenient to others . '::::pertness
'Yes , ' said Mr. Devereux , ' I think the fault I speak of is most evident ; when there is <<target>> to reprove her , I am always baffled by a kind of levity which makes every warning glance aside . '::::occasion
'Then I should decidedly say refuse <<target>> , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::her
'Yet , ' said Mr. Devereux , 'if she is eager for confirmation , and regards it in its proper light , it is hard <<target>> say whether it is right to deny it to her ; it may give her the depth and earnestness which she needs . '::::to
'Poor child , ' said Mr. Mohun , 'she has great disadvantages ; <<target>> am quite sure our present system is not fit for her .::::i
Things shall be placed on a different footing , and in another <<target>> or two I hope she may be fitter for confirmation .::::year
However , before you finally decide , I should wish to <<target>> some conversation with her , and speak to you again .::::have

The question of Jane 's confirmation was decided in an unexpected manner ; for the day after Mr. Mohun 's conversation with his nephew she was attacked by <<target>> headache and sore throat , spent a feverish night , and in the morning was so unwell that a medical man was sent for from Raynham .::::a
Phyllis and Adeline were shut up in the drawing-room , and a system of quarantine established , which was happily brought to a conclusion by a note from Mrs. Weston , who kindly begged that they might be sent <<target>> her at Broomhill , and Mr. Mohun gladly availing himself of the offer , the little girls set off , so well pleased to make a visit alone , as almost to forget the occasion of it .::::to
Mrs. Weston had extended her invitation to Lilias , but she begged to be allowed to remain with her sisters , and Mr. <<target>> thought that she had been already so much exposed to the infection that it was useless for her to take any precautions .::::mohun
She was therefore declared head nurse ; and it was well that she had an energetic spirit , and so sweet a temper , that she <<target>> ready to sympathise with all Emily 's petulant complaints , and even to find fault with herself for not being in two places at once .::::was
Two of the maids were ill , and the whole care of Emily <<target>> Jane devolved upon her , with only the assistance of Esther .::::and
Emily was not very seriously ill , but Jane 's fever was very high , <<target>> Lily thought that her father was more anxious than he chose to appear .::::and
Of Jane 's own thoughts little could be guessed ; she was often delirious , <<target>> at all times speaking was so painful that she said as little as possible .::::and
Lily 's troubles seemed at their height one Sunday <<target>> , while her father was at church .::::afternoon
' I will <<target>> Esther . '::::send
'Esther is of <<target>> use . '::::no
'And therefore I do not like to <<target>> her so long alone with Jane .::::leave
Pray spare me a <<target>> smile . '::::little
'Then come back <<target>> . '::::soon
Lily was glad to escape <<target>> no more objections .::::with
She found Jane complaining of thirst , but to swallow gave her great pain , and she required so much attendance <<target>> some little time , that Emily 's bell was twice rung before Esther could be spared to go to her .::::for
She soon came back , saying , 'Miss <<target>> wants you directly , Miss Lilias . '::::mohun
'Tell her I will come presently , ' said Lily , who had one hand <<target>> on Jane 's burning temples , while the other was sprinkling her with ether .::::pressed
Jane drew her breath with so much difficulty that a dreadful <<target>> seized upon Lily , lest she should be suffocated .::::terror
She raised her head , and supported <<target>> till Esther could bring more pillows .::::her
Esther brought a message from Emily to hasten her return ; but Jane could not be left , <<target>> the grateful look she gave her as she arranged the pillows repaid her for all her toils .::::and
After a little time Jane became more comfortable , and said in a <<target>> , 'Dear Lily , I wish I was not so troublesome . '::::whisper
Back came Esther at this moment , saying , 'Miss Emily says <<target>> is worse , and wants you directly , Miss Lilias . '::::she
Lily hurried away to Emily 's room , and <<target>> what might well have tried her temper .::::found
Emily was flushed indeed , and feverish , but her breathing was smooth and even , and her hand and pulse cool and <<target>> , compared with the parched burning hands , and throbbings , too quick to count , which Lily had just been watching .::::slow
'Well , my dear Emily , I am sorry you do <<target>> feel better ; what can I do for you ? '::::not
'How can I be better while I am left so <<target>> , and Esther not coming when I ring ?::::long
What would happen if I <<target>> to faint away ? '::::were
'Indeed , I am very sorry , ' said Lily ; 'but <<target>> you rang , poor Jenny could spare neither of us . '::::when
'How is poor <<target>> ? '::::jenny
'Her throat is very bad , but she is quite <<target>> now , and wishes to have me there .::::sensible
Lily , if you knew how ill I <<target>> you would not leave me . '::::am
'Can I do anything for you -- <<target>> you have some coffee ? '::::will
no , it has a bad taste , <<target>> am sure it is carelessly made . '::::i
'No , I am <<target>> of it .::::tired
I wonder if I might <<target>> some tamarinds ? '::::have
' I will ask as soon <<target>> papa comes from church . '::::as
'Is he gone <<target>> church ?::::to
how could he go when we <<target>> all so ill ? '::::are
'Perhaps he was doing us more good <<target>> church than he could at home .::::at
You will be glad to hear , Emily , that he <<target>> sent for Rachel to come and help us . '::::has
but she lives so far off , and gets her letters so <<target>> , I do n't reckon at all upon her coming .::::seldom
If she could come directly it <<target>> be a comfort . '::::would
'Lily , where <<target>> the ether ?::::is
You are always taking <<target>> away . '::::it
'In Jane 's room ; <<target>> will fetch it . '::::i
Now Emily knew that Jane was very ill , and Lily 's pale cheeks , heavy eyes , and failing voice , might have <<target>> her that two sick persons were a heavy charge upon a girl of seventeen , without the addition of her caprices and fretfulness .::::reminded
And how was it that the kind-hearted , <<target>> Emily never thought of all this ?::::affectionate
It was because she had been giving way to selfishness for nineteen years ; and now the contemplation of her own sufferings was quite enough to hide <<target>> her that others had much to bear ; and illness , instead of teaching her patience and consideration , only made her more exacting and querulous .::::from
To Lily 's unspeakable relief , Miss Weston accompanied Mr. <<target>> from church , and offered to share her attendance .::::mohun
No one knew what it cost Alethea to come into the midst of a scene which constantly reminded her of the sisters she had lost , <<target>> she did not shrink from it , and was glad that her parents saw no objection to her offering to share Lily 's toils .::::but
Her experience was most valuable , and relieved Lilias of the fear that was <<target>> haunting her , lest her ignorance might lead to some fatal mistake .::::continually
The next day brought Rachel , <<target>> both patients began to mend .::::and
Jane 's recovery was quicker than Emily 's , for her constitution was not so languid , and having no pleasure in the importance of being an invalid , she was willing to exert <<target>> , and make the best of everything , while Emily did not much like to be told that she was better , and thought it cruel to hint that exertion would benefit her .::::herself
Both were convalescent before the fever attacked Lily , who was severely ill , but not alarmingly <<target>> , and her gentleness and patience made Alethea delight in having the care of her .::::so
Lily was full of gratitude to her kind friend , and felt quite happy when Alethea chanced one day to call her by the name of Emma ; she almost <<target>> she was taking the place of that sister , and the thought cheered her through many languid hours , and gave double value to all Alethea 's kindness .::::hoped
It happened one day that Jane , having finished her book , looked round for some other occupation ; she knew <<target>> Miss Weston had walked to Broomhill ; Rachael was with Lilias , and there was no amusement at hand .::::that
At last she recollected that her papa had said in the morning , that he hoped to see her and Emily in the <<target>> in the course of the day , and hoping to meet her sister , she resolved to try and get there .::::schoolroom
The room had been Mr. Mohun 's sitting-room since the beginning of their illness , and it looked so very comfortable <<target>> she was glad she had come , though she was so tired she wondered how she should get back again .::::that
Emily was not there , so she lay down on the <<target>> and took up a little book from the table .::::sofa
The title was Susan Harvey , or Confirmation , and she read it with more interest as she remembered with a pang that this was the day of the confirmation , to <<target>> she had been invited ; she soon found herself shedding tears over the book , she who had never yet been known to cry at any story , however affecting .::::which
She had not finished when Mr. Devereux came in to look for Mr. Mohun , and finding her there , was going away as soon <<target>> he had congratulated her on having left her room , but she begged him to stay , and began asking questions about the confirmation .::::as
'Were there many <<target>> ? '::::people
'Did the Stoney Bridge people <<target>> a disturbance ? '::::make
'How many of <<target>> people ? '::::our
'Did all the girls <<target>> caps ? '::::wear
Jane was rather surprised at the shortness of her cousin 's answers , but she <<target>> on , as he stood before the fire , apparently in deep thought .::::went
'Did you give Mary <<target>> a ticket ? '::::wright
'Then , of course , you did <<target>> give one to Ned Long .::::not
I thought you would never succeed in making <<target>> remember which is the ninth commandment . '::::him
' I did not <<target>> him . '::::refuse
did he improve in <<target>> portentous manner ? '::::a
'Well , you must have been <<target>> merciful than I expected . '::::more
'Robert , you must have lost the use of your <<target>> , for want of us to talk to .::::tongue
I shall be affronted if you go into a <<target>> study the first day of seeing me . '::::brown
He smiled in a constrained manner , and after a few minutes said , ' I have <<target>> considering whether this is a fit time to tell you what will give you pain .::::been
You must tell me if <<target>> can bear it . '::::you
'About Lily , or <<target>> little ones ? '::::the
Your father wished me to speak to you , but I would not have done so on this first <<target>> , but what you have just been saying makes me think this is the best occasion . '::::meeting
'Let me know ; I do not like <<target>> , ' said Jane , sharply .::::suspense
' I think it right to tell you , Jane , that neither your father nor <<target>> thought it would be desirable for you to be confirmed at this time . '::::i
'Do you really <<target>> it ? '::::mean
'Look back on the past year , and say if <<target>> sincerely think you are fit for confirmation . '::::you
'As to that , ' said Jane , 'the best people are <<target>> saying that they are not fit for these things . '::::always
'None can call themselves worthy of them ; but I think the conscience of some would bear them witness that they had profited <<target>> far by their present means of grace as to give grounds for hoping that they would derive benefit from further assistance . '::::so
'Well , I suppose I must be very bad , since you see it , ' said Jane , <<target>> a manner rather more subdued ; 'but I did not think myself worse than other people . '::::in
'Is a Christian called , only to <<target>> no worse than others ? '::::be
I see , I mean -- <<target>> tell me my great fault .::::pray
Pertness , I suppose -- <<target>> of gossip ? '::::love
'There must be a deeper root of evil , of <<target>> these are but the visible effects , Jane . '::::which
said Jane , now <<target>> really impressed .::::seeming
' I think , Jane , that the greatest and <<target>> dangerous fault of your character is want of reverence .::::most
I think it is want of reverence which makes you press forward to that for which you confess yourself unfit ; it is want of reverence for holiness which makes you not care to attain it ; want of reverence for the Holy Word that makes you <<target>> it as a mere lesson ; and in smaller matters your pertness is want of reverence for your superiors ; you would not be ready to believe and to say the worst of others , if you reverenced what good there may be in them .::::treat
Take care that your want of reverence is <<target>> in reality want of faith . '::::not
Jane 's spirits were <<target>> and subdued .::::weak
It was a great shock to her to hear that she was not thought worthy of confirmation ; her faults had never been called by so hard a name ; <<target>> was in part humbled , and in part grieved , and what she thought harshness in her cousin ; she turned away her face , and did not speak .::::she
Jane tried to speak , but sobs prevented her , <<target>> she gave way to a violent fit of crying .::::and
He would have been glad to see tears of repentance , but he was afraid that she was weeping over <<target>> unkindness , and that he might have done what might be hurtful to her in her weak state .::::fancied
He said a few kind words , and tried to console her , but <<target>> change of tone rather added to her distress , and she became hysterical .::::this
He was much vexed and alarmed , and , <<target>> the bell , hastened to call assistance .::::ringing
He found Esther , and sent her to Jane , and on returning to the schoolroom with some water , he found her lying exhausted on the sofa ; he therefore went in search of his uncle , who <<target>> overlooking some farming work , and many were the apologies made , and many the assurances he received , that it would be better for her in the end , as the impression would be more lasting .::::was
Jane was scarcely conscious of her cousin 's departure , or of Esther 's arrival , but after <<target>> some water , and lying still for a few moments , she exclaimed , 'Oh , Robert !::::drinking
and gasped and <<target>> again .::::sobbed
Esther thought she had guessed the cause of <<target>> tears , and tried to comfort her .::::her
Miss Jane , there will be another confirmation some day ; it was a <<target>> thing you were too ill , to be sure , but -- '::::sad
Esther was amazed , and asked if she should <<target>> Miss Weston , who was now with Lilias .::::call
cried Jane , nearly <<target>> into hysterics .::::relapsing
'She shall not see me <<target>> this state . '::::in
Esther hardly knew what to do , but she tried to soothe and comfort her by following what was evidently the feeling predominating in Jane 's mind , as indicated by her broken sentences , <<target>> said , 'It was a pity , to be sure , that Mr. Devereux came and talked so long , he could not know of your being so very weak , Miss Jane . '::::and
'Yes , ' said Jane , faintly , ' I could have <<target>> it better if he had waited a few days . '::::borne
'Yes , Miss , when you had not been so very ill. Mr. Devereux is <<target>> very good gentleman , but they do say he is very sharp . '::::a
'He means to be kind , ' said Jane , 'but <<target>> do not think he has much consideration , always . '::::i
'Yes , Miss Jane , that is just <<target>> Mrs. White said , when -- '::::what
Esther 's speech was cut short <<target>> the entrance of Miss Weston .::::by
Jane started up , dashed off her tears , and tried to look as usual , but the paleness of her <<target>> , and the redness of her eyes , made this impossible , and she was obliged to lie down again .::::face
Esther left the room , and Miss Weston did not feel intimate enough with Jane to ask any questions ; she gave her some sal volatile , talked kindly <<target>> her of her weakness , and offered to read to her ; all the time leaving an opening for confidence , if Jane wished to relieve her mind .::::to
The book which lay near her accounted , as she thought , for her agitation , and she blamed herself for having judged <<target>> harshly as deficient in feeling , now that she found her so much distressed , because illness had prevented her confirmation .::::her
Under this impression she honoured her reserve , while she <<target>> with more affection of Lily 's open heart .::::thought
Jane , who never took , or expected others to take , the most favourable view of people 's motives , <<target>> Alethea knew the cause of her distress , and disliked her the more , as having witnessed her humiliation .::::thought
Such was Jane 's love of gossip that the next time she was alone with Esther she asked for the history of Mrs. White , thus teaching <<target>> maid disrespect to her pastor , indirectly complaining of his unkindness , and going far to annul the effect of what she had learnt at school .::::her
Perhaps during her hysterics Jane 's conduct was not under control , but subsequent silence was in <<target>> power , and could she be free from blame if Esther 's faults gained greater ascendency ?::::her
The next day Mr. Mohun attempted to speak to Jane , but being both frightened and unhappy , she found it very easy and natural , as well as very convenient , to fall into hysterics <<target>> , and her father was obliged to desist , regretting that , at the only time she was subdued enough to listen to reproof , she was too weak to bear it without injury .::::again
Rachel , who was nearly as despotic among the young ladies as she had been in former times in the <<target>> , now insisted on Emily 's going into the schoolroom , and when there , she made rapid progress .::::nursery
Alethea was amused to see how Jane 's decided will and lively spirit would induce Emily <<target>> make exertions , which no persuasions of hers could make her think other than impossible .::::to
A few days more , and they were nearly well again ; and Lilias so far recovered as to be able to spare her kind friend , who <<target>> home with a double portion of Lily 's love , and of deep gratitude from Mr. Mohun ; but these feelings were scarcely expressed in words .::::returned
Emily gave her some graceful thanks , <<target>> Jane disliked her more than ever .::::and
It was rather a dreary time that now commenced with the young ladies ; they were tired of <<target>> the same faces continually , and dispirited by hearing that the fever was spreading in the village .::::seeing
The autumn was far advanced , the weather was damp and gloomy , and the sisters sat round the fire shivering with cold , <<target>> the large room dreary and deserted , missing the merry voices of the children , and much tormented by want of occupation .::::feeling
They could not go out , their hands were not steady enough to draw , they felt every letter which they had to write a heavy burden ; neither Emily nor Lily could like needlework ; they could have <<target>> music , for the piano at the other end of the room seemed to be in an Arctic Region , and they did little but read novels and childish stories , and play at chess or backgammon .::::no
Jane was the <<target>> off .::::best
Mrs. Weston sent her a little sock , with a request that she would make out the way in which it was knit , in a complicated feathery pattern , <<target>> in puzzling over her cotton , taking stitches up and letting them down , she made the time pass a little less heavily with her than with her sisters .::::and
It was at this time that Lady Rotherwood and her daughter arrived at Devereux Castle , and Mr. Mohun was obliged to go to meet her <<target>> , leaving his three daughters to spend a long winter evening by themselves , in their doleful and dismal way , as Lily called it .::::there
The evening had closed in , but they did not ring for candles , lest they should make it seem longer ; and Jane was just beginning to laugh at Emily for the <<target>> state of her frock and collar , tumbled with lying on the sofa , when the three girls all started at the unexpected sound of a ring at the front door .::::deplorable
With a rapid and joyful suspicion who it might be , Emily and Lilias sprang to the door , Jane thrust the poker into the fire , in a desperate attempt to produce a flame , drove <<target>> arm-chair off the hearth-rug , whisked an old shawl out of sight , and flew after them into the hall , just as the deep tones of a well-known voice were heard greeting old Joseph .::::an

'Well , ' said Jane , 'do let us in the meantime make <<target>> room look more fit to be seen before he comes down . '::::the
The alacrity which had long been wanting to Lilias and Jane had suddenly returned , and they succeeded in making the room look <<target>> comfortable , compared with its former desolate aspect , before William came down , and renewed his inquiries after all the family .::::surprisingly
'And how is my <<target>> 's deafness ? '::::father

'No , he only came home in <<target>> vacation , ' said Emily .::::the

'Oh yes , <<target>> much ! '::::very
'And , ' added Lily , 'Alethea walks with us , and sings with <<target>> , and teaches at school , and knows all the poor people . '::::me
' I must go and see those <<target>> to-morrow , ' said William .::::children
The evening passed very pleasantly ; and perhaps , in truth , Captain Mohun and his sisters were surprised to find each other so <<target>> ; for , in the eyes of the young ladies , he was by far the most awful person in the family .::::agreeable
When he had been last at home Harry 's recent death had thrown <<target>> gloom over the whole family , and he had especially missed him .::::a
Himself quick , sensible , clever , and active , he was intolerant of opposite qualities , and the principal effect of that visit to Beechcroft was to make all the younger <<target>> afraid of him , to discourage poor Claude , and to give to himself a gloomy remembrance of that home which had lost its principal charms in his mother and Harry .::::ones
He had now come home rather from a sense of duty than an expectation of pleasure , <<target>> he was quite surprised to find how much more attractive the New Court had become .::::and
Emily and Lilias were now conversible and intelligent companions , better suited to him than Eleanor had ever been , and he had himself <<target>> these four years acquired a degree of gentleness and consideration which prevented him from appearing so unapproachable as in days of old .::::in
Claude came home from Oxford , not actually ill , but in the ailing condition in which he often was , <<target>> weak enough to give his sisters a fair excuse for waiting upon him , and petting him all day long .::::just
About the same time Phyllis and Adeline came back from Broomhill , and there was great joy at <<target>> New Court at the news that Mrs. Hawkesworth was the happy mother of a little boy .::::the
Claude was much pleased by being asked by Eleanor to be godfather <<target>> his little nephew , whose name was to be Henry .::::to
Perhaps he hoped , what Lilias was quite sure of , that <<target>> did not think him unworthy to stand in Harry 's place .::::eleanor
The choice of the other sponsors <<target>> not meet with universal approbation .::::did
Emily thought it rather hard that Mr. Hawkesworth 's sister , Mrs. Ridley , should have been chosen before herself , and both she and Ada would have greatly preferred either <<target>> Rotherwood , Mr. Devereux , or William , to Mr. Ridley , while Phyllis had wanderings of her own how Claude could be godfather without being present at the christening .::::lord
One evening Claude was writing his answer to Eleanor , sitting <<target>> the sofa table where a small lamp was burning .::::at
Jane , attracted by its bright and soft radiance , <<target>> and sat down opposite to him with her work .::::came
said Lily , after about <<target>> quarter of an hour .::::a
'How red you <<target>> , Jane .::::look
What is the <<target>> ? '::::matter
asked Jane , <<target>> still redder .::::becoming
'It is holding your face down over that baby 's hood , ' said <<target>> , 'you will sacrifice the colour of your nose to your nephew . '::::emily
Claude now asked Jane for the sealing-wax , folded up his letter , sealed it , put on a stamp , and as Jane was leaving <<target>> room at bedtime , said , 'Jenny , my dear , as you go by , just put that letter in the post-bag . '::::the
Jane obeyed , and <<target>> the room .::::left
' I could not help coming , ' said he , 'to <<target>> you of the trap in which Brownie has been caught . '::::tell
said Lily , ' I fancied I saw <<target>> peeping slyly at your letter . '::::her
'Just so , ' said Claude , 'and I hope <<target>> has experienced the truth of an old proverb . '::::she
Claude read , 'Jane desires me to say that a hood for the baby shall be sent in <<target>> course of a week , and she hopes that it may be worn at the christening .::::the
I should rather say I hope it may be lost in the transit , for assuredly the head that it covers must be infected with <<target>> far worse than the scarlet fever -- the fever of curiosity , the last quality which I should like my godson to possess .::::something
My only consolation is , that he will see the full deformity of the vice , as , poor <<target>> fellow , he becomes acquainted with `` that worst of plagues , a prying maiden aunt . ''::::little
If Jane was simply curious , I should not complain , but her love of investigation is not directed to what ought to be known , but rather to find out some wretched subject for petty scandal , to <<target>> every action , and to add to the weight of every misdeed , and all for the sake of detailing her discoveries in exchange for similar information with Mrs. Appleton , or some equally suitable confidante . '::::blacken
'And enough , too , I <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::hope
'It ought to <<target>> her ! '::::cure
said Claude , 'no such thing ; cures are not wrought in this way ; this is only a joke , and to keep it up , I will tell you <<target>> piece of news , which Jane must have spied out in my letter , as I had just written it when I saw her eyes in a suspicious direction .::::a
It was settled that Messieurs Maurice and Redgie are to go for two hours a <<target>> , three times a week , to Mr. Stevens , during the holidays . '::::day
'The new Stoney <<target>> curate ? '::::bridge
'It is very hard upon them , ' said Claude , 'and <<target>> tried to prevent it , but the Baron was quite determined .::::i
Now I will begin to talk about this plan , <<target>> see whether Jenny betrays any knowledge of it . '::::and
it will be <<target>> ! '::::rare
cried Lily ; 'but do not speak of <<target>> before the Baron or William . '::::it
'Let it be at luncheon , ' said <<target>> , 'you know they never appear .::::emily
Do you mean to <<target>> the letter ? '::::send
'Not that part of it , ' said Claude , 'you see I can tear <<target>> the last page , and it is only to add a new conclusion .::::off
Jane had certainly not spent the evening in an agreeable manner ; she had not taken her seat at Claude 's table with any evil designs towards his letter , but his writing was clear and legible , and <<target>> eye caught the word 'Maurice ; ' she wished to know what Claude could be saying about him , and having once begun , she could not leave off , especially when she saw her own name .::::her
When aware of the compliments he was paying her , she looked at him , but his eyes were fixed on his pen , and no smile , no significant <<target>> betrayed that he was aware of her observations ; and even when he gave her the letter to put into the post-bag he looked quite innocent and unconcerned .::::expression
On the other hand , she did not like to think that he had been sending such a character of her to Eleanor in sober sadness ; it was impossible <<target>> find out whether he had sent the letter ; she could not venture to beg him to keep it back , she could only trust to his good- nature .::::to
At luncheon , as they had agreed , Lily began <<target>> asking where her papa and William were gone ?::::by
Claude answered , 'To Stoney Bridge , to call upon Mr. Stevens ; they mean to <<target>> him to dine one day next week , to be introduced to his pupils . '::::ask
'Is he an Oxford <<target>> Cambridge man ? '::::or
'Oxford , ' exclaimed Jane , quite forgetting whence she had <<target>> her information , 'he is a fellow of -- '::::derived
said Lily ; 'how do <<target>> know that ? '::::you
'Why , we have all been talking <<target>> him lately , ' said Jane .::::of
'Because he is to tutor the <<target>> , ' said Jane .::::boys
'When did you hear that he <<target>> to tutor the boys ? '::::is
'You did , <<target>> you ? '::::did
' I feel convinced , if so , that you must <<target>> be what you are so often called , a changeling .::::really
You were , doubtless , looking <<target>> my shoulder at the moment .::::over
This is quite <<target>> discovery .::::a
We shall have to perform a brewery of egg-shells this evening , and put the elf to flight with a red-hot poker , and what a different sister Jane we shall recover , instead of this little mischief-making sprite , so quiet , so reserved , never intruding her <<target>> , showing constant deference to all her superiors -- yes , and to her inferiors , shutting her eyes to the faults of others , and when they come before her , trying to shield the offender from those who regard them as merely exciting news .

Claude 's speech had become much more serious than he intended , and he felt quite guilty when he had finished , so <<target>> it was not at all an undesirable interruption when Phyllis and Adeline asked for the story of the brewery of egg-shells .::::that
Emily and Lilias kindly avoided looking at Jane , who , after fidgeting <<target>> her chair and turning very red , succeeded in regaining outward composure .::::on

why was my innocent general observation construed <<target>> an attack upon Miss Weston ? '::::into
'Because there is something invidious in <<target>> tone , ' said Lily .::::your
'What kind of girl <<target>> that Florence ? '::::is
a nice , lively , pleasant <<target>> , ' said Claude .::::girl
' I can not make out what her pursuits are , ' <<target>> Lily ; 'Rotherwood never talks of her reading anything . '::::said
'So that is the friend <<target>> recommend , Lily ! '::::you
'Well , Claude , that is what I <<target>> a great shame , ' said Emily .::::call
'Stay , ' said Claude , 'you have heard but half <<target>> story , I say that this is the reaction .::::my
Florence has no lack of sense , and if you young ladies are <<target>> , you may help her to find the use of it . '::::wise
Claude 's further opinion did not transpire , as dinner was announced , and nothing more <<target>> said about Lady Florence till the girls had an opportunity of judging for themselves .::::was
She had a good deal of her brother 's vivacity , with gentleness and grace , which made her very <<target>> , and her perfect recollection of the New Court , and of childish days , charmed her cousins .::::engaging
Lady Rotherwood was very kind and affectionate , <<target>> held out hopes of many future meetings .::::and
The next day Maurice and Reginald came home from school , bringing a better character for diligence than <<target>> , on which they founded hopes that the holidays would be left to their own disposal .::::usual
They were by no means pleased with the arrangement made with Mr. Stevens and most unwillingly did <<target>> undertake the expedition to Stony Bridge , performing the journey in a very unsociable manner .::::they
Maurice was no horseman , and chose to jog on foot through three miles of lane , while Reginald 's pony cantered merrily <<target>> , its master 's head being intent upon the various winter sports in which William and Lord Rotherwood allowed him to share .::::along
This time it was phrenology , for which the <<target>> heads of Lilias and Jane afforded unusual facility .::::cropped
There was , however , but a limited supply of heads willing to be fingered , and Maurice returned to the most abiding <<target>> his tastes , and in an empty room at the Old Court laboured assiduously to find the secret of perpetual motion .::::of
A few days before Christmas Rachel Harvey again took leave of Beechcroft , with <<target>> promise that she would make them another visit when Eleanor came home .::::a
Before she went she gave Emily a useful caution , telling her it <<target>> not right to trust her keys out of her own possession .::::was
It was what Miss Mohun never would have done , <<target>> had never once committed them even to Rachel .::::she
'With due deference to Eleanor , ' said Emily , with her winning <<target>> , 'we must allow that that was being over cautious . '::::smile
Rachel smiled , but her lecture <<target>> not averted by the compliment .::::was
'It might have been very well since you have known me , Miss Emily , but I do not know what would have come of it , if I had been too much trusted when I was a giddy young thing like <<target>> ; that girl comes of a bad lot , and if anything is to be made of her , it is by keeping temptation out of her way , and not letting her be with that mother of hers . '::::esther
Rachel had rather injured the effect of her advice by behaving too like a mistress during her visit ; Emily had more <<target>> once wished that all servants were not privileged people , and she was more offended than convinced by the remonstrance .::::than
'Slee , sla , slud , <<target>> in the mud , O !::::stuck
it is pretty to wade through a flood , Come , wheel round , The <<target>> we have found , Would he an estate at a farthing a pound . '::::dirt
Lily 's illness interrupted her teaching at the village school for many <<target>> , and she was in no great haste to resume it .::::weeks
Alethea Weston seemed to enjoy doing all that was required , and Lily left it in her hands , glad to <<target>> her eyes as much as possible to the disheartening state the parish had been in ever since her former indiscretion .::::shut
The approach of Christmas , however , made it necessary for her to exert herself a little more , and her interest in parish <<target>> revived as she distributed the clothing-club goods , and in private conference with each good dame , learnt the wants of her family .::::matters
But it was sad to miss several names struck out of the list for non- attendance at church ; and when Mrs. Eden came for her <<target>> 's clothing , Lily remarked that the articles she chose were unlike those of former years , the cheapest and coarsest she could find .::::child
St. Thomas 's day was marked by the <<target>> , called at Beechcroft 'gooding . '::::custom
Each mother of a family came to all the principal houses in the parish to receive sixpence , towards <<target>> a Christmas dinner , and it was Lily 's business to dispense this dole at the New Court .::::providing
With a long list of names and a heap of silver before her , she sat at the oaken table by the open chimney in the hall , returning a nod or <<target>> smiling greeting to the thanks of the women as they came , one by one , to receive the little silver coins , and warm themselves by the glowing wood fire .::::a
Pleasant as the task was at <<target>> , it ended painfully .::::first
Agnes Eden appeared , in order to claim the double <<target>> allotted to her mother , as a widow .::::portion
This was the first time that Mrs. Eden had asked for the gooding-money , and <<target>> knew that it was a sign that she must be in great distress .::::lily
Agnes made her a little courtesy , and crept away again as soon as she had received her shilling ; but Mrs. <<target>> , who was Mrs. Eden 's neighbour , had not quite settled her penny-club affairs , and remained a little longer .::::grey
They spoke of the children , and of a few other little matters , and <<target>> something was said about Mrs. Eden ; Lily asked if the blacksmith helped her .::::presently
no , Miss Lilias , he will do nothing for her <<target>> she sends her child to school and to church .::::while
He will not speak <<target>> her even .::::to
Not a bit of butter , nor a morsel of bacon , has been in her house since Michaelmas , and <<target>> she would have done if it was not for Mr. Devereux and Mrs. Weston , I can not think . '::::what
Lilias , much shocked by this account of the distress into which she and Jane had been the means of bringing the widow , reported it to her father and to the Rector ; entreating the former to <<target>> her rent , which he willingly promised to do , and also desired his daughters to give her a blanket , and tell her to come to dine house whenever any broth was to be given away .::::excuse
Mr. Devereux , who already knew of her troubles , and allowed her a small <<target>> weekly , now told his cousins how much the Greys had assisted her .::::sum
Andrew Grey had dug up and housed her winter 's store of potatoes , he had <<target>> work for her , and little Agnes often shared the meals of his children .::::sought
The Greys had a large family , very young , so that <<target>> that they did for her was the fruit of self-denial .::::all
Innumerable were the kindnesses which they performed unknown <<target>> any but the widow and her child .::::to
More , by a hundred times , did they assist her , than the thoughtless girls who had occasioned her <<target>> , though Lily was not the only one who felt that nothing was too much for them to do .::::sufferings
Nothing , perhaps , would have been too much , except to bear her in mind and steadily aid her in little things ; <<target>> Lily took no account of little things , talked away her feelings , and thus all her grand resolutions produced almost nothing .::::but
In Emily 's favourite phrase , each <<target>> thing was 'not worth while . '::::individual
When Lilias did think it 'worth while , ' she would do a great deal upon impulse , sometimes <<target>> more zeal than discretion , as she proved by an expedition which she took on Christmas Eve .::::with
Mr. Mohun did not allow the poor of the village to depend entirely on the gooding for their Christmas dinner , but on the 24th of December a large <<target>> of excellent beef broth was prepared at the New Court , and distributed to all his own labourers , and the most respectable of the other cottagers .::::mess
In the course of the afternoon Lily found <<target>> one portion had not been given out .::::that
Neither of them could walk as far as the New Court , and most of their neighbours had followed Farmer <<target>> , and had therefore been excluded from the distribution , so that there was no one to send .::::gage
Lily , therefore , resolved herself to carry the broth to them , if she could find an escort , which was not an easy matter , <<target>> the frost had that morning broken up , and a good deal of snow and rain had been falling in the course of the day .::::as
In the hall she met Reginald , just turned out of <<target>> 's workshop , and much at a loss for employment .::::maurice
'Redgie , ' said she , 'you <<target>> do me a great kindness . '::::can
'If it is not a <<target>> , ' returned Reginald .::::bore
' I only want you to walk <<target>> me to South End . '::::with
said Reginald ; ' I thought the little Misses were too <<target>> to put their dear little proboscises outside the door . '::::delicate
'That is the reason I ask you ; I do not think Emily <<target>> Jane would like it , and it is too far for Claude .::::or
Those poor old Martins have not got their broth , and <<target>> is no one to fetch it for them . '::::there
'Then do not be half an <<target>> putting on your things . '::::hour
'Thank you ; and do not run off , and make me spend an hour <<target>> hunting for you , and then say that I made you wait . '::::in
' I will <<target>> fast enough .::::wait
You are not so bad as Emily , ' said <<target>> , while Lily ran upstairs to equip herself .::::reginald
When she came down , she was glad to find her escort employed in singeing the end of the tail of the old rocking-horse at the fire <<target>> the hall , so that she was not obliged to seek him in the drawing-room , where her plans would probably have met with opposition .::::in
She had , however , objections <<target>> answer from an unexpected quarter .::::to
Reginald was much displeased when she took <<target>> of the pitcher of broth .::::possession
'Then you ought , like the courteous Rinaldo , <<target>> carry it for me , ' said Lily .::::to
' I touch <<target>> nasty thing !::::the
Throw it into the <<target>> , Lily . '::::gutter
He made an attempt to dispose of it in that manner , which it required all Lily 's strength <<target>> withstand , as well as an imploring 'Now , Redgie , think of the poor old people .::::to
Remember , you <<target>> promised . '::::have
I never promised to walk <<target>> a greasy old pitcher .::::with
What am I to do if <<target>> meet Miss Weston ? '::::we
Lily contrived to overcome Reginald 's refined notions sufficiently to make him allow her to carry the pitcher ; and when he <<target>> whistled up two of the dogs , they proceeded merrily along the road , dirty and wet though it was .::::had
Their walk was not entirely without adventures ; first , they had to turn back in the path <<target>> the river side , which would have saved them half a mile , but was now flooded .::::by
Old Neptune flew to the rescue , and to the great alarm of Lily , Reginald ran up with a stick ; <<target>> , however , a labourer at the same time came out with a pitchfork , and beat off the enemy .::::happily
These two delays , together with Reginald 's propensity for cutting sticks , and <<target>> breaking ice , made it quite late when they arrived at South End .::::for
It was not often that Lily went to South End ; the old people were delighted to see her , and detained her for some time by a long story about <<target>> daughter at service , while Reginald looked the picture of impatience , drumming on his knee , switching the leg of the table , and tickling Neptune 's ears .::::their
When they left the cottage it was much later and darker than they had expected ; but Lily was unwilling <<target>> to encounter the perils of the lane , and consulted her brother whether there was not some other way .::::again
He gave notice of a cut across some fields , which would take them into the turnpike <<target>> , and Lily agreeing , they climbed over a gate into a pathless turnip field .::::road
Reginald strode along first , calling to the dogs , while Lily followed , abstaining from dwelling on the awkward circumstance that every step she took led <<target>> farther from home , and rejoicing that it was so dark that she could not see the mud which plastered the edge of her petticoats .::::her
After plodding through three very long fields , they found <<target>> shut in by a high hedge and tall ditch .::::themselves
'That fool of <<target>> farmer ! '::::a
'What is to <<target>> done ? '::::be
'How do you propose to <<target>> into it ? '::::get
'There was a gap here last <<target>> , ' said the boy .::::summer
Come back ; try the next field ; <<target>> must have a gate somewhere . '::::it
Back they went , after seeing the <<target>> 's cart from Raynham pass by .::::carrier
'Redgie , it must <<target>> half-past five !::::be
We shall never <<target>> in time .::::be
Aunt Rotherwood coming <<target>> ! '::::too
'One comfort is that it is too dark <<target>> any one to see us . '::::for
'Not very dark , either , ' said Reginald ; ' <<target>> believe there is a moon if one could see it .::::i
here comes some <<target>> on horseback .::::one
'Do not fancy yourself <<target>> important , Lily .::::so
William , is <<target>> you ? '::::that
exclaimed William , suddenly <<target>> his horse .::::checking
'Lily , what is <<target>> this ? '::::all
'Six , at least ; how <<target>> you be so absurd ? '::::could
William rode quickly on ; Reginald laughed , and they plodded on ; at length a tall dark figure was seen coming <<target>> them , and Lily started , as it addressed her , 'Now what is the meaning of all this ? '::::towards
'Oh , William , have <<target>> come to meet us ?::::you
Thank you ; I <<target>> sorry -- '::::am
'Make haste ; my <<target>> is come .::::aunt
How could you make the people <<target>> home so anxious ? '::::at
William gave Lily his arm , and on finding she was both tired and wet , again scolded her , <<target>> so fast that she was out of breath , then complained of her folly , and blamed Reginald .::::walked
It was very unpleasant , and yet she was very much obliged <<target>> him , and exceedingly sorry he had taken so much trouble .::::to
They came home at <<target>> seven o'clock .::::about
As they ran down Reginald overtook them , and <<target>> entered the drawing-room as the dinner-bell was ringing .::::they
William did not appear for some time , and his apologies <<target>> not such as to smooth matters for his sister .::::were
Perhaps it was for this very reason that Mr. Mohun allowed <<target>> to escape with no more than a jesting reproof .::::lily
This was just the contrary to what Emily wished her aunt to believe , and Claude was much diverted <<target>> the struggle between her politeness to Lord Rotherwood and her desire to maintain the credit of the family .::::with
It was untoward ; but in the course of the evening she was a little comforted by a proposal from Lady Rotherwood to take her and Lilias to a ball at Raynham , which was <<target>> take place in January ; and as soon as the gentlemen appeared , they submitted the invitation to their father , while Lady Rotherwood pressed William to accompany them , and he was refusing .::::to
'What are soldiers intended for <<target>> to dance ! '::::but
' I never dance , ' said <<target>> , with a grave emphasis .::::william
' I am out of the <<target>> , ' said the Marquis .::::scrape
Well , young ladies , <<target>> the Baron propitious ? '::::is
'He says he will consider of <<target>> , ' said Emily .::::it
'Oh then , he will let you go , ' said <<target>> , 'people never consider when they mean no . '::::florence
'No , Florence , ' said her brother , 'Uncle Mohun 's `` consider <<target>> it '' is equivalent to Le Roi 's `` avisera . '' '::::of
'What is he <<target>> ? '::::saying
asked Lily , <<target>> to listen .::::turning
'Oh , that my wig is <<target>> no ball-going condition . '::::in
' I give small hopes of both , ' <<target>> Claude ; 'you will only have Emily . '::::said
'Why do you think <<target>> , Claude ? '::::so
cried both Florence <<target>> Lilias .::::and
' I am very angry with the Baron , ' said Lord Rotherwood ; 'he is grown inhospitable : he will not let me <<target>> here to-morrow -- the first Christmas these five years that I have missed paying my respects to the New Court sirloin and turkey .::::come
It is too bad -- and <<target>> Westons dining here too . '::::the
Lord Rotherwood and Lilias both caught the sound , and laughed , but Emily , unwilling that Florence <<target>> see what liberties they took with her brother , asked quickly why he was not to come .::::should
' I think we are much obliged to him , ' said Florence , 'it would be too bad to leave <<target>> and me to spend our Christmas alone , when we came to the castle on purpose to oblige him . '::::mamma
'Ay , and he says he will not let me come here , because I ought to <<target>> the Hetherington people ocular demonstration that I go to church , ' said Lord Rotherwood .::::give
'Very right , as Eleanor would <<target>> , ' observed Claude .::::say
'Very likely ; but I do n't care for the Hetherington folks ; they do not know how to make <<target>> holly in the church fit to be seen , and they will not sing the good old Christmas carols .::::the
Andrew Grey is worth all the <<target>> choir put together . '::::hetherington
'Possibly ; but how are they to mend , <<target>> their Marquis contents himself with despising them ? '::::if
'That is too <<target>> , Claude .::::bad
When you heard how submissively I listened to the Baron , and know I mean to abide by what he said , you <<target>> to condole with me a little , if you have not the grace to lament my absence on your own account .::::ought
Why , I thought myself as regular a part of the <<target>> as the mince-pies , and almost as necessary . '::::feast
Here a request for some music <<target>> an end to his lamentations .::::put
Lilias was vexed by the uncertainty about the ball , and <<target>> , besides , too tired to play with spirit .::::was
She saw that Emily was annoyed , and she felt ready to cry before the evening was over ; but still she was proud of her exploit , and when , after the party was gone , Emily began to represent to her the <<target>> that her aunt was likely to form of her character , she replied , 'If she thinks the worse of me for carrying the broth to those poor old people , I am sure I do not wish for her good opinion . '::::estimate
He said that he thought her too young for gaieties , and , besides , that late <<target>> never agreed with her , and he advised her to wait for the 30th of July .::::hours
Lilias knew that it was <<target>> to say any more .::::useless
She was much disappointed , and at the same time <<target>> with herself for caring about such a matter .::::provoked
Her temper was out of order on Christmas Day ; and while she wondered why she could not enjoy the festival as formerly , <<target>> thoughts fitted to the day , she did not examine herself sufficiently to find out the real cause of her uncomfortable feelings .::::with
The clear frost was only cold ; the bright sunshine did not rejoice her ; the holly and the mistletoe seemed ill <<target>> ; and none of the pleasant sights of the day could give her such blitheness as once she had known .::::arranged
The excited manner in which she spoke of it convinced Mr. Mohun that he had acted wisely <<target>> not allowing her to go , since the very idea seemed to turn her head .::::in
'Loving she is , and <<target>> though wild . '::::tractable
In a day or two Lady Rotherwood and <<target>> daughter called at the New Court .::::her
Lady Rotherwood greeted her nieces very affectionately , gave a double caress to Adeline , stroked her pretty curls , admired her beadwork , talked <<target>> her about her doll , and then proceeded to invite the whole family to a Twelfth-Day party , given for their especial benefit .::::to
The little Carringtons and the Weston <<target>> were also to be asked .::::girls
Emily and Lilias were eagerly expressing their delight when suddenly a trampling , like a charge of horse , was heard in the hall ; the <<target>> was thrown back , and in rushed Reginald and Phyllis , shouting , 'Such fun ! -- the pigs are in the garden ! '::::door
Reginald was hot and gloveless ; his shoes far from clean ; his brown curls hanging in great disorder from his Scotch cap ; his handkerchief <<target>> ; his jacket dusty -- but this was no great matter , since , as Emily said , he was 'only a boy . '::::loose
His bright open smile , the rough , yet gentleman-like courtesy of his advance to the Marchioness , his comical roguish glance at Emily , to see if she was very angry , and <<target>> defy her if she were , and his speedy exit , all greatly amused Lady Florence , and made up for what there might have been of the wild schoolboy in his entrance .::::to
Poor Phyllis had neither the excuse of being a schoolboy nor the good-humoured fearlessness that freed her brother from embarrassment , and she stood stock-still , awkward and dismayed , not daring to advance ; longing to join in the pig-chase , yet afraid to run away , her eyes stretched wide open , her hair streaming into <<target>> , her bonnet awry , her tippet powdered with seeds of hay , her gloves torn and soiled , the colour of her brown holland apron scarcely discernible through its various stains , her frock tucked up , her stockings covered with mud , and without shoes , which she had taken off at the door .::::them
What makes you <<target>> a figure ?::::such
Come and speak to <<target>> Rotherwood . '::::aunt
Phyllis drew off her left-hand glove , and held out her hand , making a <<target>> sidelong steps towards her aunt , who gave her a rather reluctant kiss .::::few
Lily bent her bonnet into shape , and pulled down her frock , while <<target>> laughed , patted her cheek , and asked what she had been doing .::::florence
Afraid of some further exposure , Emily hastily sent her away to be made fit to <<target>> seen , and Lady Rotherwood went on caressing Ada and talking of something else .::::be
Emily had no opportunity of explaining that this was not Phyllis 's usual condition , <<target>> she was afraid that Lady Rotherwood would never believe that it was accidental .::::and
She was much annoyed , especially as the catastrophe <<target>> served to divert Mr. Mohun and Claude .::::only
Of all the family William and Adeline <<target>> took her view of the case .::::alone
Ada lectured Phyllis on her 'naughtiness , ' and plumed herself on <<target>> aunt 's evident preference , but William was not equally sympathetic .::::her
He was indeed as fastidious as Emily herself , and as much annoyed by such misadventures ; but he maintained that she was to blame for them , saying <<target>> the state of things was not such as it should be , and that the exposure might be advantageous if it put her on her guard in future .::::that
It appeared as if poor Phyllis was to be punished for the vexation which she had caused , for in the course <<target>> her adventures with Reginald she caught a cold , which threatened to prevent her from being of the party on Twelfth-Day .::::of
She had a cough , which did not give her by any means <<target>> much inconvenience as the noise it occasioned did to other people .::::as
Every morning and every evening she anxiously asked her sisters <<target>> they thought she would be allowed to go .::::whether
Another of the party <<target>> likely to fail .::::seemed
He soon betook himself to the sofa in the drawing-room , attended <<target>> Lily , with pillows , cushions , ether , and lavender .::::by
Late in the afternoon the pain diminished a little , and he fell asleep , to <<target>> great joy of his sister , who sat watching him , scarcely daring to move .::::the
Suddenly a frightful scream and loud crash <<target>> heard in the room above them .::::was
Claude started up , and Lily , <<target>> , 'Those tiresome children ! '::::exclaiming
hurried to the room whence <<target>> noise had come .::::the
Reginald and Phyllis had been climbing to the top of a great <<target>> , by means of a ladder of chairs and tables .::::wardrobe
While Phyllis was descending her brother had made some demonstration that startled her , <<target>> she fell with all the chairs over her , but without hurting herself .::::and
'You naughty troublesome child , ' cried <<target>> , in no gentle tone .::::lily
'How often have you been told <<target>> leave off such boyish tricks !::::to
And you choose the very place for disturbing poor Claude , <<target>> his bad headache , making it worse than ever . '::::with
Phyllis tried to speak , but only <<target>> in giving a dismal howl .::::succeeded
She went on screaming , sobbing , and roaring so loud <<target>> she could not hear Lily 's attempts to quiet her .::::that
Reginald ran off , and as he dashed out of the room , came full against <<target>> , who caught hold of him , calling out to know what was the matter .::::william
'Oh , Claude , I <<target>> very sorry ! '::::am
' I thought some one <<target>> half killed ! '::::was
He sank into a chair , pressing his hand <<target>> his temples , and looking very faint .::::on
William supported him , and Lily stood by , repeating , ' I <<target>> very sorry -- it was all my fault -- my scolding -- '::::am
Go away , <<target>> . '::::children
Phyllis had already gone , and the next moment thrust into Lily 's <<target>> the first of the medicaments which she had found in the drawing-room .::::hand
The faintness soon went off , but Claude thought he had better not struggle against the headache <<target>> longer , but go to bed , in hopes of being better the next day .::::any
William went with him to his room , and Lilias lingered <<target>> the stairs , very humble , and very wretched .::::on
William soon came forth again , and <<target>> the meaning of the uproar .::::asked
'It was all my fault , ' said she ; ' I was vexed at Claude 's <<target>> waked , and that made me speak sharply to Phyllis , and set her roaring . '::::being
' I do not know which is the <<target>> inconsiderate of you , ' said William .::::most
'You can not blame me more than <<target>> deserve , ' said Lily .::::i
'May I go to <<target>> Claude ? '::::poor
' I suppose so ; but I do <<target>> see what good you are to do .::::not
Quiet is the only <<target>> for him . '::::thing
Lily , however , went , and Claude gave her <<target>> understand that he liked her to stay with him .::::to
She arranged his blinds and curtains comfortably , <<target>> then sat down to watch him .::::and
William went to the drawing-room <<target>> write a letter .::::to
Just as he had sat down he heard a strange noise , a sound of <<target>> , which seemed to come from the corner where the library steps stood .::::sobbing
What is the <<target>> now ? '::::matter
' I am so very <<target>> , ' sighed she .::::sorry
'Well , leave <<target>> crying . '::::off
She would willingly have obeyed , but her sobs were beyond her own control ; and <<target>> went on , 'If you are sorry , there is no more to be said .::::he
I hope it will be a <<target>> to you another time .::::lesson
You are quite old enough to have <<target>> consideration for other people . '::::more
' I am very sorry , ' again <<target>> Phyllis , in a mournful note .::::said
'Be sorry , only <<target>> not roar .::::do
You make that noise from habit , I am convinced , <<target>> you may break yourself off it if you choose . '::::and
Phyllis crept out of the room , and in a few minutes more <<target>> door was softly opened by Emily , returning from her walk .::::the

Is his head <<target>> ? '::::worse
'Yes , the children have been <<target>> their best to distract him .::::doing

'Phyllis or not , it <<target>> not to be .::::ought
What will that child grow up , if you let <<target>> be always running wild with the boys ? '::::her
'Consider , William , that you see us at a disadvantage ; we are <<target>> unsettled by this illness , and the children have been from home . '::::all
'As if they learnt all <<target>> wild tricks at Broomhill !::::these
That excuse will not <<target>> , Emily . '::::do
'And then they are always worse in <<target>> holidays , ' pleaded Emily .::::the
'Yes , there are reasons to be found for everything that goes <<target>> ; but if you were wise you would look deeper .::::wrong

I do not think <<target>> use your energies .::::you
I believe that my father sees that this is the case , <<target>> it is not his habit to find fault with little things .::::but
You may think that , therefore , <<target>> need not interfere , but -- '::::i
'But remember that comfort is <<target>> up of little things .::::made
And , Emily , when you consider how much my father has suffered , and how desolate his home must be at the best , <<target>> think you will be inclined to exert yourself to prevent him from being anxious about the children or harassed by your negligence . '::::i
Thank you for what <<target>> have said .::::you
Now that I am stronger , I hope to do <<target>> , and I will really do my best . '::::more
At this moment Emily was sincere ; but the good impulse of one <<target>> was not likely to endure against long cherished habits of selfish apathy .::::instant
Claude did not appear again till <<target>> middle of the next day .::::the
His headache was nearly gone , but he was so languid <<target>> he gave up all thoughts of Devereux Castle that evening .::::that
Lord Rotherwood , who always seemed to know what was going on at Beechcroft , came to inquire <<target>> him , and very unwillingly allowed that it would be better for him to stay at home .::::for
Lilias wished to remain with him ; but this her cousin would not permit , saying that he could <<target>> consent to lose three of the party , and Florence would be disappointed in all her plans .::::not
Neither would Claude hear of keeping her at home , and she was obliged to satisfy herself with putting his arm-chair in his favourite corner by the fire , with the little <<target>> before it , supplied with books , newspaper , inkstand , paper-knife , and all the new periodicals , and he declared that he should enjoy the height of luxury .::::table
Phyllis considered it to be entirely her fault that he could not go , and <<target>> too much grieved on that account to have many regrets to spare for herself .::::was
She enjoyed seeing Adeline dressed , and <<target>> Esther 's admiration of her .::::hearing
And having seen the party set off , she made her way into the drawing-room , opening the door as gently as possible , just wide <<target>> to admit her little person , then shutting it as if she was afraid of hurting it , she crept across the room on tiptoe .::::enough
Claude suspected that she had been more blamed the day before than the occasion called for , and <<target>> to make amends he kissed her , and said something good-natured about spending the evening together .::::wishing
Phyllis , a little reassured , <<target>> to her own occupations .::::went
She took out a large heavy volume , laid <<target>> on the window-seat , and began to read .::::it
Claude was interested in his own book , and <<target>> not look up till the light failed him .::::did
He then , closing his book , gave a long yawn , and looked round for his little companion , almost <<target>> , from the stillness of the room , that she must have gone to seek for amusement in the nursery .::::thinking
She was , however , still kneeling against the window-seat , her elbows planted <<target>> the great folio , and her head between her hands , reading intently .::::on

It was very nice to save the dragon-fly ; and it is very nice to let flies out of spiders ' webs , only they always have their legs and wings torn , and look miserable ; and it was very nice to put the poor little <<target>> back into their nest when they tumbled out , and then to see their mother come to feed them ; and it was very pleasant to help the poor goose that had put its head through the pales , and could not get it back .::::thrushes

They lingered long over the tea-table , talking and laughing , and when <<target>> had finished , Phyllis discovered with surprise that it was nearly bedtime .::::they
The promised story was not omitted , however , and Phyllis , sitting on <<target>> little footstool at her brother 's feet , looked up eagerly for it .::::a
'Well , Phyl , I will tell you a true history that I heard from an officer <<target>> had served in the Peninsular War -- the war in Spain , you know . '::::who
'And the Portuguese <<target>> helping us .::::were
Just after we had taken the town of Ciudad Rodrigo , some of the Portuguese soldiers went to find lodgings for <<target>> , and , entering a magazine of gunpowder , made a fire on the floor to dress their food .::::themselves
A most dangerous thing -- <<target>> you know why ? '::::do
'What book , you <<target>> child ? '::::wise
'The Magazine ; I thought a magazine was one of <<target>> paper books that Maurice is always reading . '::::the
said Claude , laughing , ' a magazine is a store , and as <<target>> different things are stored in those books , they are called magazines .::::many
A powder magazine is a <<target>> of barrels of gunpowder .::::store
Now do you see why it was <<target>> to light a fire ? '::::dangerous
'It blows up , ' said Phyllis ; 'that was the <<target>> why Robinson Crusoe was afraid of the lightning . '::::reason
'Right , Phyl , and therefore a candle is never allowed to be carried into a powder <<target>> , and even nailed shoes are never worn there , lest they should strike fire .::::magazine
One spark , lighting on a grain of gunpowder , scattered on the floor , <<target>> communicate with the rest , make it all explode , and spread destruction everywhere .::::might
Think in what fearful peril these reckless men had placed , not <<target>> themselves , but the whole town , and the army .::::only

'Told all the people <<target>> run away . '::::to
where could they <<target>> gone ?::::have
No , he raised no alarm , but he ordered the Portuguese out of the building , and with the help of <<target>> English sergeant , he carried out , piece by piece , all the wood which they had set on fire .::::an
Now , imagine what <<target>> must have been .::::that
An explosion might happen at any moment , yet they had to walk steadily , slowly , and with the <<target>> caution , in and out of this place several times , lest one spark might fly back . '::::utmost
'Then they were <<target>> ? '::::saved
cried Phyllis , breathlessly ; 'and <<target>> became of them afterwards ? '::::what
'They were both killed in battle , the officer , I <<target>> , in Badajoz , and the sergeant sometime afterwards . '::::believe
Phyllis gave a deep sigh , <<target>> sat silent for some minutes .::::and
Next , Claude began a droll Irish fairy-tale , which he told with spirit and humour , <<target>> as some people would have scorned to exert for the amusement of a mere child .::::such
Phyllis laughed , and was so happy , that when suddenly they heard the sound of wheels , she started up , <<target>> what brought the others home so soon , and was still more surprised when Claude told her it was past ten .::::wondering

Aunt Rotherwood is so much pleased that he <<target>> to go entirely to oblige her . '::::consents
'By the bye , what makes <<target>> Baron look so mischievous ? '::::the

'How could she bring herself to <<target>> so horrid a sound ? '::::utter
' I wish you would hold your tongue , or go to bed , ' said <<target>> , ' I have heard nothing but this nonsense all the way home . '::::william
While William was sending off Ada to bed , and Phyllis was departing <<target>> her , Lily told Claude that the Captain had been most agreeable .::::with
' I feared , ' said she , 'that he would be too grand for <<target>> party , but he was particularly entertaining ; Rotherwood was quite eclipsed . '::::this

'Now , young ladies , reserve the rest <<target>> your adventures for the morning . '::::of
Adeline had full satisfaction in recounting the governess 's mistake to the maids , and in hearing from Esther that <<target>> was no wonder , 'for that she looked more like a born lady than Lady Florence herself ! '::::it
Lilias 's fit of petulance about the ball had returned more strongly than ever ; she partly excused herself to her own mind , <<target>> fancying she disliked the thought of the lonely evening she was to spend more than that of losing the pleasure of the ball .::::by
Mr. Mohun would be absent , conducting Maurice to a new <<target>> , and Claude and Reginald would also be gone .::::school
Her temper was affected in various ways ; she wondered that William and Emily <<target>> like to go -- she had thought that Miss Weston was wiser .::::could
Her daily occupations were irksome -- <<target>> was cross to Phyllis .::::she
It made her very angry to be accused by the young brothers <<target>> making a fuss , and Claude 's silence was equally offensive .::::of
It was upon principle <<target>> he said nothing .::::that
He knew it was nothing but a transient attack of silliness , of which she was herself ashamed ; but he was sorry to leave her <<target>> that condition , and feared Lady Rotherwood 's coming into the neighbourhood was doing her harm , as certainly as it was spoiling Ada .::::in
The ball day arrived , and it was marked by a great burst of fretfulness on the part of poor <<target>> , occasioned by so small a matter as the being asked by Emily to write a letter to Eleanor .::::lilias
Emily was dressing to go to dine at <<target>> Castle when she made the request .::::devereux
'What have I <<target>> say ?::::to
I never could write a letter in my life , at <<target>> not to the Duenna -- there is no news . '::::least
'About the boys going to <<target>> , ' Emily suggested .::::school
'As if she did not know all about <<target>> as well as I can tell her .::::them
She does not care for my news , <<target>> see no one to hear gossip from .::::i
I thought you undertook all the <<target>> correspondence , Emily ? '::::formal
'Do you call a letter to <<target>> sister formal correspondence ! '::::your
'Everything is formal <<target>> her .::::with
All I can say is , that you and William are going to <<target>> ball , and she will say that is very silly . '::::the
'Eleanor once went to this Raynham ball ; it <<target>> her first and last , ' said Emily .::::was
'Yes , not long before they went to Italy ; it will only make <<target>> melancholy to speak of it -- I declare I can not write . '::::her
'And I have no time , ' said Emily , 'and you know how <<target>> she is if she does not get her letter every Saturday . '::::vexed
'All for the sake of punctuality , <<target>> else , ' said Lily .::::nothing
'Well , ' said Emily , 'only papa does <<target>> like that she should be disappointed . '::::not
'You might have written , if you had <<target>> dawdled away all the morning . '::::not
Lily defended herself sharply , and the dispute was growing vehement , when <<target>> happily cut it short by a summons to Emily to make haste .::::william
When they were gone Lily <<target>> time for reflection .::::had
Good-temper was so common a virtue , and generally cost her so little effort , that she took no pains <<target>> cultivate it , but she now felt she had lost all claim to be considered amiable under disappointment .::::to
It was too late to bear <<target>> privation with a good grace .::::the
She was heartily ashamed of having been so cross about a trifle , and ashamed <<target>> being discontented at Emily 's having a pleasure in which she could not share .::::of
Would this have been the <<target>> a year ago ?::::case
She was afraid to ask herself the question , and without going deep enough into the history of her own mind to make her sorrow and shame profitable , she tried <<target>> satisfy herself with a superficial compensation , by making herself particularly agreeable to her three younger sisters , and by writing a very long and entertaining letter to Eleanor .::::to
She met Emily with a cheerful face the next day , and listened with pleasure to her history <<target>> the ball ; and when Mr. Mohun returned home he saw that the cloud had passed away .::::of
Lilias neglected to take the only <<target>> of preventing its recurrence .::::means
The next week <<target>> departed .::::william
Before he went he gave his sisters great pleasure by desiring them to write to him , <<target>> not to let him fall into his ancient state of ignorance respecting the affairs of Beechcroft .::::and

Devereux Castle now became the great <<target>> of the Miss Mohuns .::::resort
They were always sure <<target>> a welcome there .::::of
Lady Rotherwood liked to patronise them , <<target>> Florence was glad of their society .::::and
This was quite according to the wishes of Emily , who now had nothing left to desire , but that the style of dress suitable , in <<target>> opinion , to the granddaughter of the Marquis of Rotherwood , was more in accordance with the purse of the daughter of the Esquire of Beechcroft .::::her
She was at once too indolent and too sensible ; she saw <<target>> vulgarity of finery , and only aimed at simplicity and elegance .::::the
During their girlhood Emily and Lilias had had no more concern with their clothes than with their food ; Eleanor had carefully taught them plain needlework , and <<target>> had assisted in making more than one set of shirts ; but they had nothing to do with the choice or fashion of their own apparel .::::they
They were always dressed alike , and in as plain and childish <<target>> manner as they could be , consistently with their station .::::a
On Eleanor 's marriage a suitable allowance was given to each of them , in order that they might <<target>> their own clothes , and until Rachel left them they easily kept themselves in very good trim .::::provide
When Esther came Lily cheerfully took the trouble of her own small decorations , <<target>> it as her payment for the pleasure of having Esther in the house .::::considering
Emily , however , neglected the useful 'stitch in <<target>> , ' till even 'nine ' were unavailing .::::time
She soon found herself compelled to buy new ready-made <<target>> , and expected Lilias to do the same .::::articles
But Lilias demurred , for she was too wise to think it necessary to ruin herself <<target>> company with Emily , and thus the two sisters were no longer dressed alike .::::in
A constant fear tormented Emily lest she should disgrace Lady Rotherwood , or be considered by some stranger as merely a poor <<target>> of the great people , and not as the daughter of the gentleman of the oldest family in the county .::::relation
She was , therefore , anxious to be perfectly fashionable , and not to wear the same things too often , and in <<target>> disinterested desire to maintain the dignity of the family the allowance which she received at Christmas melted away in her hands .::::her
Lily , though exempt from this folly , <<target>> not in a satisfactory state of mind .::::was
She was drawn off from her <<target>> by a kind of spell .::::duties
Florence was indeed a very sweet-tempered and engaging creature ; but her mind was not equal to that of Lilias , and there was none of the pleasure of <<target>> upon her , and looking up to her , which Lilias had learnt to enjoy in the company of her brother Claude , and of Alethea Weston .::::relying
It was only that Lily 's own mind had been turned away from <<target>> former occupations , and that she did not like to resume them .::::her
Her calls at Devereux Castle <<target>> up many afternoons .::::took
Florence continually lent her amusing books , her aunt took great interest <<target>> her music , and she spent much time in practising .::::in
The mornings were cold and dark , and she could not rise early , and <<target>> her time slipped away , she knew not how , uselessly and unsatisfactorily .::::thus
The three younger ones were left more <<target>> themselves , and to the maids .::::to
Jane sought for amusement in village gossip , and the little ones , finding <<target>> nursery more agreeable than the deserted drawing-room , made Esther their companion .::::the
Mr. Mohun had , at this time , an unusual quantity of business on his hands ; he saw that the girls were not going on <<target>> , but he had reasons for not interfering at present , and he looked forward to Eleanor 's visit as the conclusion of their trial .::::well
' I can not think , ' said Marianne Weston one day <<target>> her sister , 'why Mr. Mohun comes here so often . '::::to
Alethea told her he had some business with their mamma , and she thought <<target>> more of the matter , till she was one day questioned by Jane .::::no
She was rather afraid of Jane , who , as she thought , disliked her , and wished to turn her into ridicule ; so <<target>> was with no satisfaction that she found herself separated from the others in the course of a walk , and submitted to a cross-examination .::::it
Jane asked , in a mysterious manner , <<target>> had been at Broomhill that morning .::::who
Mohun , ' <<target>> Marianne .::::said
'What did he go <<target>> for ? '::::there
'Alethea says he has some <<target>> with mamma . '::::business
'Then you did not hear <<target>> it was ? '::::what

'And is Alethea <<target>> ? '::::there
'His business must be <<target>> her too .::::with
Can not you <<target>> it ? '::::guess
'No , ' said <<target>> , looking amazed .::::marianne
'How can you be <<target>> slow ? '::::so
' I am not sure that I would guess if I could , ' <<target>> Marianne , 'for I do not think they wish me to know . '::::said
nonsense , it is fine fun to <<target>> out secrets , ' said Jane .::::find
'You will know it at last , you may be sure , so there can be no harm in making it out beforehand , so as <<target>> have the pleasure of triumph when the wise people vouchsafe to admit you into their confidence ; I am sure I know it all . '::::to
'Little Mrs. Propriety , ' said Jane , 'you are already assuming all the <<target>> of my Aunt Marianne , and William 's Aunt Marianne -- oh !::::dignity
you do not mean it , you <<target>> only trying to tease me . '::::are
'You will see that <<target>> am right . '::::i
Here they were interrupted , and as soon as she returned from her walk Marianne , perplexed <<target>> amazed , went to her mother , and told her all that Jane had said .::::and
'How can she be <<target>> silly ? '::::so
'Then it is all nonsense , as I <<target>> , ' said Marianne , joyfully .::::thought
' I should not like Alethea <<target>> marry an old man . '::::to
Mohun is very unlikely to make himself <<target>> , ' said Mrs. Weston .::::ridiculous
'If it had been Captain Mohun , now -- ' <<target>> stopped , and blushed , finding her speech unanswered .::::marianne
A few days after , Mr. Mohun overtook Marianne and her mother , as he was riding <<target>> from Raynham , and dismounting , led his horse , and walked on with them .::::home
Either not perceiving Marianne , or not caring <<target>> she heard him , he said ,::::whether
'Has Miss Weston received the <<target>> she expected ? '::::letter
'No , ' said Mrs. Weston , 'she thinks , as there is no answer , the family must be gone abroad , <<target>> very probably they have taken Miss Aylmer with them ; but she has written to another friend to ask about them . '::::and
'In that case , ' said Mrs. Weston , 'there <<target>> be plenty of time to communicate with her .::::will
I can see some of the friends of the family when I go to <<target>> , for we must not leave Mr. Weston in solitude another spring . '::::london
' I have some business in London , and I think <<target>> shall meet the Hawkesworths there in May or June . '::::i
After a little more conversation Mr. Mohun took his leave , and <<target>> soon as he had ridden on , Marianne said , 'Oh !::::as
mamma , I could <<target>> help hearing . '::::not
'My dear , ' said Mrs. Weston , ' I know you may be trusted ; but I should not <<target>> told you , as you may find such a secret embarrassing when you are with your young friends . '::::have
'And so they are to <<target>> a governess ? '::::have
'Yes ; and we are trying to <<target>> Miss Aylmer for them . '::::find
I am glad of it ; how much <<target>> and Ada will like her ! '::::phyllis
'Yes , it will be very good for them ; <<target>> wish I knew the Grants ' direction . '::::i
'Well , I hope Jane will not question me any more ; it <<target>> be very difficult to manage , now I know the truth . '::::will
But poor Marianne was <<target>> to escape .::::not
Jane was on the watch to find her alone , and <<target>> soon as an opportunity offered , she began : -::::as
'Well , auntie , <<target>> discoveries ? '::::any
'Indeed , Jane , it is not right to <<target>> Mr. Mohun can do anything so absurd . '::::fancy
'That is as people may <<target>> , ' said Jane .::::think
' I wish you would not talk <<target>> that way , ' said Marianne .::::in
'Now , Marianne , ' pursued the tormentor , 'if you can explain the <<target>> I will believe you , otherwise I know what to think . '::::mystery
Jane really almost persuaded herself that she was right , as she perceived that her father <<target>> always promoting intercourse with the Westons , and took pleasure in conversing with Alethea .::::was
She twisted everything into a confirmation of her idea ; while the prospect of having Miss Weston for a stepmother increased her former dislike ; but she kept her <<target>> to herself for the present , triumphing in the idea that , when the time came , she could bring Marianne as a witness of her penetration .::::suspicions
The intercourse between the elder Miss Mohuns and Miss Weston was , however , not so frequent as formerly ; and Alethea herself could not <<target>> remark that , while Mr. Mohun seemed to desire to become more intimate , his daughters were more backward in making appointments with her .::::but
This was chiefly remarkable <<target>> Emily and Jane .::::in
Lilias was the same in openness , earnestness , and affection ; but there was either a languor about her spirits or <<target>> were too much excited , and her talk was more of novels , and less of poor children than formerly .::::they
Marianne began to grow indignant , especially on one occasion , when Emily and Lily went out for a <<target>> with Lady Rotherwood , forgetting that they had engaged to take a walk with the Westons that afternoon .::::drive
'It is really a great deal too bad , ' said she to Alethea ; 'it is exactly <<target>> we have read of in books about grandeur making people cast off their old friends . '::::what
'Do not be unfair , <<target>> , ' said Alethea .::::marianne
'Lady Florence has a <<target>> right to -- '::::better
'What , because she is <<target>> marquis 's daughter ? '::::a
'Because she is <<target>> cousin . '::::their
' I do not believe Lilias really cares for her <<target>> as much as for you , ' said Marianne .::::half
'It is all because they <<target>> fine people . '::::are
'Nay , Marianne , if our cousins were to come into this neighbourhood , <<target>> should not be as dependent on the Mohuns as we now feel . '::::we
' I hope we should not <<target>> our engagements with them . '::::break
'Perhaps they could <<target>> help it .::::not
When their aunt came to fetch them , knowing how seldom they can have the carriage , it would have <<target>> scarcely civil to say that they had rather take a walk with people they can see any day . '::::been
'Last year Lilias would have let Emily <<target>> by herself , ' said Marianne .::::go
'Alethea , they are all different since that <<target>> Rotherwood came -- all except Phyl .::::lady
Ada is a great deal more conceited than she was when she was staying here ; she pulls out her curls , and <<target>> in the glass much more , and she is always talking about some one having taken her for Lady Florence 's sister .::::looks
And , Alethea , just fancy , she does not like me to go <<target>> a gate before her , because she says she has precedence ! '::::through
Alethea was much amused , but she would not let <<target>> condemn the whole family for Ada 's folly .::::marianne
'It will all come right , ' said she , 'let us <<target>> patient and good-humoured , and nothing can be really wrong . '::::be
Almost in spite of herself she had bestowed upon Lilias no small share of her affection , and she would have been more pained by her neglect if she <<target>> not partaken of that spirit which 'thinketh no evil , but beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , and endureth all things . '::::had
Lilias was not satisfied with either herself , her home , her sisters , or her school ; <<target>> was far from being the fresh , happy creature that she had been the year before .::::she
She had seen the fallacy of her principle of love , but in her self-willed adherence to it she had lost the strong sense and habit of duty <<target>> had once ruled her ; and in a vague and restless frame of mind , she merely sought from day to day for pleasure and idle occupation .::::which
Lent came , but she was not roused , she was only more uncomfortable <<target>> she saw the Rector , or Alethea , or went to church .::::when
The school became a burthen instead of a <<target>> , and her attendance there a fatigue .::::delight
On going in one Sunday morning , very late , she <<target>> Alethea teaching her class as well as her own .::::found
With a look of vexation she inquired , as she took her place , if it was so very late , and on the way to church she said <<target>> , ' I thought I was quite in time ; I do not like to hurry the children -- the distant ones have not time to come .::::again
'That clock is always too <<target>> , ' said Lily .::::fast
The next Sunday was very cold , and Lilias did not feel at all disposed <<target>> leave the fire when the others prepared to go to the afternoon school .::::to
' I was chilled at church , and my feet are still <<target>> ice ; I will follow you in five minutes . '::::like
Alethea went , and Lilias <<target>> by the fire .::::lingered
Mrs. Weston once asked her if she knew how late it was ; but still she <<target>> , until she was startled by the sound of the bell for evening service .::::waited
' I would have taken them , ' said she , 'but that Robert does not like <<target>> to teach the great girls , and I do think Alethea might have heard them . '::::me
'It is very provoking , ' said Lily , pettishly ; ' I thought <<target>> might depend -- ' She turned and saw Miss Weston close to her .::::i

I only thought you liked <<target>> my class . '::::hearing
They were by this time at the church door , and as they entered Alethea <<target>> herself for feeling grieved , and Lily awoke to a sense of her unreasonableness .::::blamed
In the night , however , snow began to fall , and <<target>> morning showed the February scene of thawing snow and pouring rain .::::the
Going out was impossible , both <<target>> that day and the next .::::on
Wednesday dawned fair and bright ; but just after breakfast Lily received a little note , with the intelligence that Mr. Weston had arrived at Broomhill on Monday <<target>> , and with his wife and daughters was to set off that very day to make a visit to some friends on the way to London .::::evening
Had not the weather been so bad , Alethea said she should have come to take leave of her New Court friends on Tuesday , but she could now only send this <<target>> to tell them how sorry she was to go without seeing them , and to beg Emily to send back a piece of music which she had lent to her .::::note
The messenger was Faith Longley , who was to accompany them , and who now was going home to <<target>> leave of her mother , and would call again for the music in a quarter of an hour .::::take
Lily ran to ask her <<target>> they were to go .::::when
'At eleven , ' was the answer ; and Lily telling her she need not call <<target>> , as she herself would bring the music , went to look for it .::::again
Emily sent many apologies and civil messages , and Lily set out at a rapid pace <<target>> walk to Broomhill by the road , for the thaw had rendered the fields impassable .::::to
Fast as she walked , <<target>> was too late .::::she
She had the mortification of seeing the carriage turn out at the gates , and take the Raynham road ; she <<target>> not even seen , nor had she a wave of the hand , or a smile to comfort her .::::was
Almost crying with vexation , she walked home , and <<target>> down to write to Alethea , but , alas !::::sat
she did not know where <<target>> direct a letter .::::to
Bitterly did she repent of the burst of ill-temper which had stained her last meeting with her friend , and <<target>> was scarcely comforted even by the long and affectionate letter which she received a week after their departure .::::she
Kindness from her was now forgiveness ; never did she so strongly feel Florence 's inferiority ; and she <<target>> at herself for having sought her society so much as to neglect her patient and superior friend .::::wondered

It was the day of the school prize giving , and she reflected with shame , how much less she knew about the children than last year , and how little they owed to her ; she feared to think of the approach <<target>> Easter Day , a dread which she had never felt before , and which she knew to be a very bad sign ; but her regret was not repentance -- she talked , and laughed , and tried to feel at ease .::::of
Agnes Eden 's happy face was the <<target>> pleasant sight on that day .::::most
The little girl received a Bible , and as it was given to her her pale face was coloured with bright pink , her <<target>> eyes lighted up , her smile was radiant with the beauty of innocence , but Lily could not look at her without self-reproach .::::blue
She resolved to make up for her former neglect by double kindness , and determined that , at <<target>> rate , Passion Week should be properly spent -- she would not once miss going to church .::::any
But on Monday , when Emily proposed to ride to Devereux Castle , <<target>> assented , only saying that they would return for evening service .::::she
About two miles from Beechcroft Lily saw a little figure in a gray cloak trudging <<target>> along the road , and as she came nearer she recognised Kezia Grey .::::steadily
She stopped and asked the child what <<target>> her so far from home .::::brought
'Is your mother <<target>> ? '::::worse
'Mother is pretty well , ' said Kezia ; 'but it <<target>> for Agnes Eden , Miss- -she is terrible bad . '::::is
'Why , she was <<target>> school yesterday . '::::at
'Yes , Miss , but she <<target>> taken bad last night . '::::was
The next afternoon Lily was just setting out to inquire for Agnes <<target>> Lord Rotherwood arrived at the New Court with his sister .::::when
A very pleasant expedition they made , but it led them so far from home <<target>> the church bell was heard pealing over the woods far in the distance .::::that
Lily could not go to Mrs. Eden 's cottage , because she did not know the nature of Agnes 's <<target>> , and her aunt could not bear that Florence should go into any house where there was illness .::::complaint
In the course of the walk , however , she met Kezia , on her way to the New Court , to ask for a blister for Agnes , the <<target>> having advised Mrs. Eden to apply to the Miss Mohuns for one , as it was wanted quickly , and it was too far to send to Raynham .::::doctor
Lily promised to send the blister as soon as possible , and desired the little messenger to return home , where <<target>> was much wanted , to help her mother , who had a baby of less than a week old .::::she
She felt as if she had been shot , <<target>> scarcely knew where she was for several moments .::::and
On coming out of church , she stood almost in a dream , while Emily and Jane were talking to the <<target>> , who told them how very ill the child was , and how little hope there was of her recovery .::::rector
He took leave of them , and Lily walked home , scarcely <<target>> the soothing words with which Emily strove to comfort her .::::hearing
The meaning passed away mournfully ; Lily sat over the <<target>> without speaking , and without attempting to do anything .::::fire
In the afternoon rain came on ; but Lily , too unhappy not to <<target>> restless , put on her bonnet and cloak , and went out .::::be
She walked quickly up the hill , and <<target>> the field where the cottage stood .::::entered
She wandered up and down the field , and at last was trying to make up her mind to return home , when <<target>> heard footsteps behind her , and turning , saw Mr. Devereux advancing along the path at the other end of the field .::::she
'Have you been to <<target>> for Agnes ? '::::inquire
I long to know , but I can not bear <<target>> ask , I can not venture in . '::::to
'Do you like to go <<target>> with me ? '::::in
' I do not think you <<target>> see anything dreadful . '::::will
'Thank you , ' said Lily , ' I <<target>> give anything to know about her . '::::would
but you need not <<target>> afraid . '::::be
He knocked at the door , but there was no answer ; he opened it , and going to the foot <<target>> the stairs , gently called Mrs. Eden , who came down calm and quiet as ever , though very pale .::::of
'No better , sir , thank <<target>> , light-headed still . '::::you
Mrs. Eden , I am so <<target>> , ' sobbed Lily .::::sorry
can you forgive <<target>> ? '::::me
'Pray do not take on so , <<target>> , ' said Mrs. Eden .::::miss
'You have always been a very kind <<target>> to her , Miss Lilias .::::friend
Do not take on <<target>> , Miss .::::so
If it is His will , nothing <<target>> have made any difference . '::::could
Lily was going to speak again , but Mr. Devereux stopped her , <<target>> , 'We must not keep Mrs. Eden from her , Lily . '::::saying
Will you walk up and <<target>> her , sir ?::::see
Lily silently followed her cousin up the narrow stairs to the upper room , where , in the white-curtained bed , lay the <<target>> child , tossing about and moaning , her cheeks flushed with fever , and her blue eyes wide open , but unconscious .::::little
A woman , whom Lily did not at first perceive to <<target>> Mrs. Naylor , rose and courtsied on their entrance .::::be
Agnes 's new Bible was beside her , and her mother told them that <<target>> was not easy if it was out of sight for an instant .::::she
'Kissy , I want my bag -- where is my thimble -- no , not that I ca n't remember -- my catechism-book -- my godfathers and godmothers in <<target>> baptism , wherein I was made a member -- my Christian name -- my name , it is my Christian name ; no , that is not it -::::my
Then she began the Creed , but , breaking off , exclaimed , 'Where is my Bible , mother , I shall read it to-morrow -- read that pretty verse about `` I am the good Shepherd -- <<target>> Lord is my Shepherd , therefore can I lack nothing -- yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for Thou art within me . ''::::the
`` I now am of that little flock Which Christ doth call His own , For <<target>> His sheep He knows by name , And He of them is known . '' '::::all
Kneeling down , he repeated the Lord 's <<target>> , and the feeble voice followed his .::::prayer
He then read the prayer for a sick child , and left the room , <<target>> he saw that Lily would be quite overcome if she remained there any longer .::::for
Mrs. Eden followed them downstairs , and again stung poor <<target>> to the heart by thanks for all her kindness .::::lily
Her tears streamed fast , but her sobs were <<target>> by awe at Mrs. Eden 's calmness .::::checked
She felt as if she <<target>> been among the angels .::::had
'How pale you <<target>> ! '::::are
said her cousin , ' I would not have taken you <<target>> if I thought it would overset you so much .::::there
Come into Mrs. Grey 's , and <<target>> down and recover a little . '::::sit
'No , no , do not let me <<target>> any one , ' said Lily .::::see
Robert , let me tell you the worst , <<target>> your kindness is more than I can bear .::::for
I promised Agnes a blister <<target>> forgot it ! '::::and
'But tell me , what <<target>> I do ? '::::shall
If your neglect has added to her sufferings , you can not remove them ; and I <<target>> not add to your sorrow unless you wished me to do so for your good . '::::would
' I do not see how I could be more <<target>> than I am now , ' said Lily .::::unhappy
' I think if you wish to turn your grief to good <<target>> you must go a little deeper than this omission . '::::account
'You mean that it is a result of general carelessness , ' said Lily ; ' I know I have been in an <<target>> idle way for some time ; I have often resolved , but I seem to have no power over myself . '::::odd
'May I ask you <<target>> question , Lily ?::::one
How have you been <<target>> this Lent ? '::::spending
'Robert , you are right , ' <<target>> Lily ; 'you may well ask .::::cried
I know I have not gone to church properly , but how could you guess the terrible way in <<target>> I have been indulging myself , and excusing myself every unpleasant duty that came in my way ?::::which
That was the very reason of this dreadful neglect ; well do I <<target>> to be miserable at Easter , the proper time for joy .::::deserve
how different it <<target>> be . '::::will
'It will be , I hope , an Easter marked <<target>> repentance and amendment , ' said the Rector .::::by
'No , Robert , do not begin to be kind to me yet , you do not know how <<target>> bad I have been , ' said Lily ; 'it all began from just after Eleanor 's wedding .::::very
A mad notion came into my <<target>> and laid hold of me .::::head
I fancied Eleanor stern , and cold , <<target>> unlovable ; I was ingratitude itself .::::and
I made a foolish theory , that regard for duty makes people cold and stern , and that feeling , which I confused with Christian love , was all that was worth <<target>> , and the more Claude tried to cure me , the more obstinate I grew ; I drew Emily over to my side , and we set our follies above everything .::::having
So my temper has been spoiling , and my mind <<target>> worse and worse , ever since we lost Eleanor .::::getting
At last different things showed me the fallacy of my principle , <<target>> then I do believe I was beyond my own management .::::but
I felt wrong , and could not <<target>> , and went on recklessly .::::mend
'Perhaps the pain you now feel may be <<target>> means of breaking the spell . '::::the
'But is it not enough to drive me mad to think that improvement in me <<target>> be bought at such a price -- the widow 's only child ? '::::should
'You forget that the loss is <<target>> blessing to her . '::::a
'Still I may pray that my punishment may <<target>> be through them , ' said Lily .::::not
'Surely , ' was the answer , 'it is grievous to see that dear child cut off ; and her <<target>> mother left desolate -- yet how much more grievous it would be to see that spotless innocence defiled . '::::patient
'If it was to fall on any one , ' said Lilias , ' <<target>> should be thankful that it is on one so fit to die . '::::i
The church bell began to ring , <<target>> they quickened their steps in silence .::::and
Presently Lily said , 'Tell me of something to do , Robert , something that may be a pledge that my sorrow is not a <<target>> shower , something unnecessary , but disagreeable , which may keep me in remembrance that my Lent was not one of self-denial . '::::passing
'You must be able to find more opportunities of self-denial <<target>> I can devise , ' said her cousin .::::than
'Of course , ' said Lily ; 'but <<target>> one thing , some punishment . '::::some
'One thing more , ' said Lily , looking down ; 'after this <<target>> fall , ought I to come to next Sunday 's feast ?::::great
I would turn away if <<target>> thought fit . '::::you
' I should think that you were now in a humble , <<target>> frame , and therefore better prepared than when self-confident . '::::contrite
how shall I <<target>> of them !::::think
but I will , ' said Lily ; 'and Robert , will you think of <<target>> when you say the Absolution now and next Sunday at the altar ? '::::me
They were by this <<target>> at the church-porch .::::time
As Mr. Devereux uncovered his head , he turned to Lilias , and said in a low <<target>> , 'God bless you , Lilias , and grant you true repentance and pardon . '::::tone
Early the next morning the toll of the passing-bell informed Lily <<target>> the little lamb had been gathered into the heavenly fold .::::that
It was thus : 'You had better find out in which duty you have <<target>> failed , and let the fulfilment of that be your proof of self-denial .::::most
Afterwards Lily learnt that Agnes had been sensible <<target>> a short time before her peaceful death .::::for
She had spoken much of her baptism , had begged to be buried next to a little <<target>> of Kezia 's , and asked her mother to give her new Bible to Kezia .::::sister
It was not till Sunday that Lilias felt <<target>> if she could ever be comforted .::::as
Her heart was indeed ready to break as she walked at the head of the school children behind the white-covered coffin , and she felt as if she did not deserve to dwell upon the child 's present happiness ; but afterwards she <<target>> relieved by joining in prayer for the pardon of our sins and negligences , and she felt as if she was forgiven , at least by man , when she joined with Mrs. Eden in the appointed feast of Easter Day .::::was
Mrs. Naylor was at church on that and several following Sundays ; but though her husband now <<target>> every kindness to his sister , he still obstinately refused to be reconciled to Mr. Devereux .::::showed
For many weeks poor little <<target>> looked very unhappy .::::kezia
Her blithe smiles were gone , her eyes filled with tears whenever she was reminded of her friend , she walked to school alone , she did not join the sports of the other children , but she kept close <<target>> the side of Mrs. Eden , and seemed to have no pleasure but with her , or in nursing her little sister , who , two Sundays after the funeral , was christened by the name of Agnes .::::to
It was agreed by Mr. Mohun and Lilias that the grave of <<target>> little girl should be marked by a stone cross , thus inscribed::::the
`` He shall gather the lambs <<target>> His arms . '' '::::in
'Truly the tender mercies of the weak , As <<target>> the wicked , are but cruel . '::::of
And how did Lilias show that she <<target>> been truly benefited by her sorrows ?::::had
Did she fall back into her habits of self-indulgence , or did she run into ill-directed <<target>> , selfish as her indolence , because only gratifying the passion of the moment ?::::activity
Those who lived with her saw but little change ; kind-hearted and generous she had ever been , and many had been her good impulses , so that while she daily became more steady in well-doing , and exerting herself <<target>> principle , no one remarked it , and no one entered into the struggles which it cost her to tame her impetuosity , or force herself to do what was disagreeable to herself , and might offend Emily .::::on
However , Emily could forgive a great deal when she found that Lily was ready to take any part of the business of the household and schoolroom , which she chose to impose upon her , without the least <<target>> , yet to leave her to assume as much of the credit of managing as she chose -- to have no will or way of her own , and to help her to keep her wardrobe in order .::::objection
Phyllis was not altered , except that she cried less , and had in a great measure cured herself of dawdling habits and tricks , by her honest efforts to obey well- remembered orders of <<target>> 's ; but still her slowness and dulness were trying to her teachers , and Lily had often to reproach herself for being angry with her 'when she was doing her best . '::::eleanor
But Adeline was Lily 's principal trouble ; there was a <<target>> in her , for which her sister could not account .::::change
Last year , when Eleanor left them , Ada was a sweet-tempered , affectionate child , docile , gentle , and , excepting a little occasional affectation and carelessness , very free from faults ; but now her attention could hardly be commanded for five minutes together ; she had lost the habit of ready and implicit obedience , was petulant <<target>> reproved , and was far more eager to attract notice from strangers -- more conceited , and , therefore , more affected , and , worse than all , Lily sometimes thought she perceived a little slyness , though she was never able to prove any one instance completely to herself , much less to bring one before her father .::::when
Thus , if Ada had done any mischief , she would indeed confess it on being examined ; but when asked why she had not told of it directly , would say she had forgotten ; she <<target>> avail herself of Phyllis 's assistance in her lessons without acknowledging it , and Lilias found it was by no means safe to leave the Key to the French Exercises alone in the room with her .::::would
Emily 's mismanagement had fostered <<target>> 's carelessness and inattention .::::ada
Lady Rotherwood 's injudicious caresses helped to make her more affected ; other faults had grown <<target>> for want of sufficient control , but this last was principally Esther 's work .::::up
Esther had done well at school ; she liked learning , was stimulated by notice , was really attached to Lilias , and tried to deserve her goodwill ; but her training at school <<target>> at home were so different , that her conduct was , even at the best , far too much of eye-service , and she had very little idea of real truth and sincerity .::::and
On first coming to the New Court she flattered the children , because she did not know how to talk to <<target>> otherwise , and afterwards , because she found that Miss Ada 's affections were to be gained by praise .::::them
Then , in her ignorant good-nature , she had no scruples about concealing mischief which the children had done , or procuring for Ada little forbidden indulgences <<target>> her promise of secrecy , a promise which Phyllis would not give , thus putting a stop to all those in which she would have participated .::::on
It was no wonder that Ada , sometimes helping Esther to deceive , sometimes deceived by her , should have learnt the same <<target>> of cunning , and ceased to think it a matter of course to be true and just in all her dealings .::::kind
But how was it that Phyllis remained the same 'honest Phyl ' that she had ever been , not one word <<target>> of aught but strict truth having ever crossed her lips , her thoughts and deeds full of guileless simplicity ?::::savouring
She met with the same temptations , the same neglect , the same bad <<target>> , as her sister ; why had they no effect upon her ?::::example
In the first place , flattery could not touch her , it was like water on a duck 's back , she did not know that it <<target>> flattery , but so thoroughly humble was her mind that no words of Esther 's would make her believe herself beautiful , agreeable , or clever .::::was
Yet she never found out that Esther over-praised her sister ; she admired Ada so <<target>> that she never suspected that any commendation of her was more than she deserved .::::much
In the meantime Emily went on contriving opportunities and excuses for spending her time at Devereux Castle , letting everything <<target>> into Lily 's hands , everything that she had so eagerly undertaken little more than a year ago .::::fall
And now all was confusion ; the excellent order in <<target>> Eleanor had left the household affairs was quite destroyed .::::which
Attention to the storeroom was one of the ways in which Lilias thought that she could best follow the <<target>> of Mr. Devereux , since Eleanor had always taught that great exactness in this point was most necessary .::::advice
She was up almost with the light , to despatch whatever household affairs could be settled without Emily , before the time came for the children 's lessons ; many hours were spent on these , <<target>> she was continually harassed by Phyllis 's dulness , Ada 's inattention , and the interruption of work to do for Emily , and often was she baffled by interference from Jane or Emily .::::while
She was conscious of her unfitness to teach the children , and often saw that her impatience , ignorance , and inefficiency , were doing mischief ; but <<target>> as this pained her , she could not speak to her father without compromising her sister , and to argue with Emily herself was quite in vain .::::much
Each day Emily grew more selfish and indolent ; now that Lily was willing to supply all that she <<target>> , and to do all that she asked , she proved how tyrannical the weak can be .::::neglected
The whole of her quarter 's allowance was spent in dress , and Lily soon found that the only chance of keeping her out of debt <<target>> to spend her own time and labour in her behalf ; and what an exertion of patience and kindness this required can hardly be imagined .::::was
Emily did indeed reward her skill with affectionate thanks and kind praises , but she interfered with her sleep <<target>> exercise , by her want of consideration , and hardened herself more and more in her apathetic selfishness .::::and
Some weeks after Easter Lilias was arranging some books on a shelf in the schoolroom , <<target>> she met with a crumpled piece of music-paper , squeezed in behind the books .::::when
It proved to be Miss Weston 's lost song , creased , torn , dust-stained , and spoiled ; she carried it <<target>> Emily , who decided that nothing could be done but to copy it for Alethea , and apologise for the disaster .::::to
Framing apologies was more in Emily 's way than copying music ; and the former task , therefore , devolved upon Lily , <<target>> occupied her all one afternoon , when she ought to have been seeking a cure for the headache in the fresh air .::::and
It was no cure to find the name of Emma Weston in the corner , and <<target>> perceive how great and irreparable the loss of the paper was to her friend .::::to
The thought of all her wrongs towards Alethea , caused more than one large tear to fall , to blot <<target>> heads of her crotchets and quavers , and thus give her all her work to do over again .::::the
In answer , she sent a very affectionate consoling letter , begging Lily to think no more of the matter ; and though she had too much regard for truth to say that she had <<target>> been grieved by the loss of Emma 's writing , she added that Lily 's distress gave her far more pain , and that her copy would have great value in her eyes .::::not
The beginning of June now arrived , and brought with it <<target>> time for the return of Claude and Lord Rotherwood .::::the
The Marquis 's carriage met him at Raynham , and he set down Claude at New Court , <<target>> his way to Hetherington , just coming in to exchange a hurried greeting with the young ladies .::::on
Their attention was principally taken <<target>> by their brother .::::up

John Ray died this morning , and they do <<target>> think that Tom Naylor will live . '::::not

He went , and <<target>> now spoke .::::lily
'There is one thing in all this , Claude , that is <<target>> of joy , Tom Naylor has sent for Robert . '::::matter
'Then , Lily , I do <<target>> heartily congratulate you . '::::most
' I hope things may go better , ' <<target>> Lily , with tears in her eyes .::::said
'The poor baby is <<target>> its grandmother .::::with
Mrs. Naylor is ill too , and every one is so afraid of the fever that <<target>> goes near them but Robert , and Mrs. Eden , and old Dame Martin .::::nobody

I am afraid the christening is to <<target>> bought by something terrible . '::::be
' I do not think those fevers are <<target>> very infectious , ' said Claude .::::often
He is wearing himself <<target>> with sitting up .::::out
Making himself nurse as well <<target>> everything else . '::::as
This was very distressing , but still Claude scarcely thought it <<target>> for the change that had taken place in Lilias .::::accounted
Her cheek was pale , her eye heavy , her voice had lost its merry tone ; Claude knew that she <<target>> had much to grieve her , but he was as yet far from suspecting how she was overworked and harassed .::::had
He spoke of Eleanor 's return , and she did not brighten ; she smiled sadly <<target>> his attempts to cheer her , and he became more and more anxious about her .::::at
He was not long in <<target>> what was the matter .::::discovering
The second day after his return Robert told them at the churchyard gate that Tom Naylor was beginning to mend , <<target>> this seemed to be a great comfort to Lily , who walked home with a blither step than usual .::::and
Ada and Phyllis were in very high spirits , because they were going to Raynham with <<target>> and Jane , and at every speech of Ada 's Lily looked more grieved .::::emily
After the Raynham party were gone <<target>> began to look for Lily .::::claude
He found her in her room , an evening dress spread on the bed , a roll of ribbon in <<target>> hand , and with the other supporting her forehead , while tears were slowly rolling down her cheeks .::::one
'Lily , my dear , <<target>> is the matter ? '::::what
no , that <<target>> not true .::::is
You have been disconsolate ever since I came home , <<target>> I will not let it go on so .::::and
Then am I to suppose that these new <<target>> are the cause of her sorrow ?::::pearlins
Come , Lily , be <<target>> yourself , and speak .::::like
Now then , that is right : make <<target>> effort , and tell me . '::::an
'There is nothing to tell , ' said Lily ; 'only you are very kind -- I do not know what <<target>> the matter with me -- only I have been very foolish of late -- and everything makes me cry . '::::is
'My poor child , I knew <<target>> had not been well .::::you
I am going to order the horses , and we will have a gallop <<target>> the Downs , and put a little colour into your cheeks . '::::over
'No , no , thank you , Claude , I can not come , indeed <<target>> can not , I have this work , which must be done to-day . '::::i
'At work at your finery <<target>> of coming out !::::instead
You must be altered , <<target>> , Lily . '::::indeed
'It is not for myself , ' said Lily , 'but I <<target>> Emily she should have it ready to wear to-morrow . '::::promised
So she is making a <<target>> of you ? '::::slave
'No , no , it <<target>> a voluntary promise .::::was
She does not care about it , only she <<target>> be disappointed , and I have promised . '::::would
' I hate <<target>> ! '::::promises
'Well , what must be , must be , so I will resign <<target>> to this promise of yours , only do not make such another .::::myself
Well , but that was not all ; you were not <<target>> about that fine green thing , were you ? '::::crying
said Lily , smiling , as <<target>> she could smile again .::::now
' I was only vexed at <<target>> about the children . '::::something
'Then what was <<target>> ? '::::it
'It was only that Ada was idle at her lessons ; I told her to learn a verb as a punishment , she went to <<target>> , and , somehow or other , Emily did not find out the exact facts , excused her , and took her to Raynham .::::emily
I was vexed , because I am sure it does Ada harm , and Emily did <<target>> understand what I said afterwards ; I am sure she thought me unjust . '::::not
'How came she not <<target>> be present ? '::::to
Housekeeper , I suppose , as I see you <<target>> all the weekly bills on your desk .::::have
Why , Lily , this <<target>> perfectly philanthropic of you .::::is

Lily looked up , and smiled ; 'Claude , how can you talk <<target>> that old , silly , nay , wicked nonsense of my principle .::::of
I was wise above what was written , and I have my punishment in the <<target>> which my `` frenzy of spirit and folly of tongue '' have wrought .::::wreck

'It is a bad prospect , but I <<target>> you see the worst side of it .::::think
You are not well , <<target>> , therefore , doleful .::::and
This , Lily , I can tell you , that the Baron always considered Emily 's government as <<target>> kind of experiment , and so perhaps he will not be so grievously disappointed as you expect .::::a
Besides , I have a strong suspicion that Emily 's own nature has quite as much to do with <<target>> present conduct as your principle , which , after all , did not live very long . '::::her
'Just long enough to unsettle me , and make it more difficult <<target>> me to get any way right , ' said Lily .::::for

Claude talked in this manner , while Lily , <<target>> with a smile , prepared her work .::::listening
He read , <<target>> she listened .::::and
It was such a treat as she had not enjoyed for a long time , <<target>> she had begun to think that all her pleasant reading days were past .::::for
Her work prospered , and her face <<target>> bright when her sisters came home .::::was
Emily was not pleased with her performance ; she said that she intended something quite different , and by <<target>> , rather than by words , indicated that she should not be satisfied unless Lily completely altered it .::::manner
It was to be worn at the castle the next evening , and Lily <<target>> she should have no time for it in the course of the day .::::knew
Accordingly , at half-past twelve , as Claude was going up to bed , he <<target>> a light under his sister 's door , and knocked to ask the cause .::::saw
At last , by threatening to awake her , for the express purpose of giving her a scolding , he made Lily <<target>> to go to bed immediately , a promise which she , poor weary creature , was very glad to make .::::promise
Claude now resolved to tell his father the state of things , for he well knew that though it was easy to obtain a <<target>> promise from Emily , it was likely to be of little effect in preventing her from spurring her willing horse to death .::::general
'In short , ' said he , 'Emily and Ada torment poor Lily every hour of her life ; she <<target>> it all as a sort of penance , and how it is to end I can not tell . '::::bears
Well , Jupiter has begun to take measures , and <<target>> asked Mrs. Weston to look out for a governess .::::has

'Thereby hangs a tale which does me no credit , ' muttered Claude , as he remembered how foolishly he had roused her <<target>> of contradiction , besides the original mischief of naming Eleanor the duenna ; 'but we will not enter into that now .::::spirit
I see this governess <<target>> their best chance .::::is
Have you heard <<target>> one ? '::::of
'Of several ; but the only one who seems likely to suit us is out of reach for the <<target>> , and I do not regret it , for I shall not decide till Eleanor comes . '::::present

'It has long been her great dread <<target>> Aunt Rotherwood should recommend one . '::::that
'Ay , Emily 's objections and your aunt 's recommendations are <<target>> I would gladly avoid , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::what

'She is already what Ada calls a monotony , and there will be nothing left of <<target>> by the time Eleanor comes , if matters go on in their present fashion . '::::her

A little change will set her to rights , and we will <<target>> her to London when we go next week to meet Eleanor .::::take

'Well , I am glad that one of my remedies meets <<target>> your approbation , ' said his father , smiling .::::with
'For the other , you are much inclined to <<target>> the cure as bad as the disease . '::::pronounce
'Not for Lily , ' <<target>> Claude , laughing .::::said
'And , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I think I can promise you <<target>> a remedy will be found for all the other grievances by Michaelmas . '::::that
Claude looked surprised , but as Mr. Mohun explained no further , only observing upon the potatoes , through which <<target>> were walking , he only said , 'Then it is next week that you go to London . '::::they
'There is much to do , both for Rotherwood and for Eleanor ; I shall go as soon <<target>> I can , but I do not think it will be while this fever is so prevalent .::::as
I had rather not be from home -- <<target>> do not like Robert 's looks . '::::i
'Thou drooping sick man , bless the guide That <<target>> , or turned thy headstrong youth . '::::checked
The thought of her brother 's kindness , and the effect of his consolation , made Lilias awake that morning <<target>> more cheerful spirits ; but it was not long before grief and anxiety again took possession of her .::::in
The first sound that she heard on opening the schoolroom window was the tolling of the church bell , <<target>> notice of the death of another of those to whom she felt bound by the ties of neighbourhood .::::giving
The Mohun party waited , as usual , to speak to him afterwards , for since his attendance upon Naylor had begun he <<target>> not thought it safe to come to the New Court as usual , lest he should bring the infection to them .::::had
'Then I hope you did not stay there <<target>> last night , ' said Mr. Mohun .::::all
'Now , ' said Mr. Mohun , ' I prescribe <<target>> you that you go home and lie down .::::for
I am going to Raynham , and I will tell your <<target>> there that you want help for the evening service .::::friend
Do not think of <<target>> again to-day .::::moving
I shall send Claude home with you to <<target>> that you obey my prescription . '::::see
Claude went home with his cousin , and his sisters saw him no more till late in the day , when he came to tell them that Mr. Mohun <<target>> brought back Dr. Leslie from Raynham with him , that Dr. Leslie had seen Mr. Devereux , and had pronounced that he had certainly caught the fever .::::had
Lily had made up her mind to this for some time , but still it <<target>> almost as great a blow as if it had come without any preparation .::::seemed
The next day was the first Sunday that Mr. Devereux had <<target>> read the service since he had been Rector of Beechcroft .::::not
The villagers looked sadly at the stranger who appeared in his place , and many tears were shed <<target>> the prayers of the congregation were desired for Robert Devereux , and Thomas and Martha Naylor .::::when
It was announced that the daily service would be discontinued for the present , and Lily <<target>> as if all the blessings which she had misused were to be taken from her .::::felt
For some time Mr. Devereux continued very ill , <<target>> Dr. Leslie gave little hope of his improvement .::::and
Mr. Mohun and Claude were his constant attendants -- <<target>> additional cause of anxiety to the Miss Mohuns .::::an
Jane was not without serious thoughts , but whether they would benefit her depended on herself ; for , as we have seen <<target>> the events of the autumn , sorrow and suffering do not necessarily produce good effects , though some effects they always produce .::::by
Thus it was <<target>> Lilias .::::with
Grief and anxiety aided her in <<target>> her will and learning resignation .::::subduing
She did not neglect her daily duties , but was more exact in their fulfilment ; and low as her spirits <<target>> been before , she now had an inward spring which enabled her to be the support of the rest .::::had
She was useful to her father , always ready to talk to Claude , or walk with him <<target>> the intervals when he was sent out of the sickroom to rest and breathe the fresh air .::::in
She was cheerful and patient with Emily , and devoid of petulance when annoyed by the spirits <<target>> the younger ones rising higher than accorded with the sad and anxious hearts of their elders .::::of
Her most painful feeling was , that it was possible that she might be punished through her cousin , as she had already been through Agnes ; that <<target>> follies might have brought this distress upon every one , and that this was the price at which the child 's baptism was to be bought .::::her
Yet Lily would not have changed her present thoughts for any <<target>> her varying frames of mind since that fatal Whitsuntide .::::of
Better feelings were springing up within her than she had then known ; the church service and Sunday were <<target>> more to her , and she was beginning to obtain peace of mind independent of external things .::::infinitely
There was no cricket on the hill , no talking in the street , no hallooing in <<target>> hay-field , and no burst of noise when the children were let out of school .::::the
Many of the people were themselves in grief for the loss of their own relations ; and when on Sunday the Miss Mohuns saw how many were dressed in black , they thought <<target>> a pang how soon they themselves might be mourning for one whose influence they had crippled , and whose plans they had thwarted during the three short years of his ministry .::::with
During this time it was hard to say whether Lord <<target>> was more of a comfort or a torment .::::rotherwood
He was attached to his cousin with all the ardour of his affectionate <<target>> , and not one day passed without his appearing at Beechcroft .::::disposition
At first it was always in the parlour at the parsonage that he took up his station , and waited till he could find some means of getting at <<target>> or his uncle , to hear the last report from them , and if possible to make Claude come out for a walk or ride with him .::::claude
He could not , or would not see why Mr. Mohun should allow Claude to run the risk of infection rather than himself , and thus <<target>> kept his mother in continual anxiety , and even his uncle could not feel by any means certain that he would not do something imprudent .::::he
At last a promise was extracted from him that he would not again enter the parsonage , but he would not gratify <<target>> Rotherwood so far as to abstain from going to Beechcroft , a place which she began to regard with horror .::::lady
He now was almost constantly at the New Court , talking over the reports , and quite <<target>> Emily by never desponding , and never choosing to perceive how bad things really were .::::provoking
Every day which was worse than the last was supposed to be the crisis , <<target>> every restless sleep that they heard of he interpreted into the beginning of recovery .::::and
At last , however , after ten days of suspense , the report began to improve , and Claude <<target>> to the New Court with a more cheerful face , to say that his cousin was munch better .::::came
The world seemed immediately to grow brighter , people went about with joyful looks , Lord Rotherwood declared that from the first he had known all would be well , and Lily <<target>> to hope that now she had been spared so heavy a punishment , it was a kind of earnest that other things would mend , that she had suffered enough .::::began
The future no longer hung before her in such dark colours as before Mr. Devereux 's illness , though still the New Court <<target>> in no satisfactory state , and still she had reason to expect that her father and Eleanor would be disappointed and grieved .::::was
Thankfulness that Mr. Devereux was recovering , and that Claude had escaped the infection , made her once more hopeful and cheerful ; <<target>> let the morrow take thought for the things of itself , rejoicing that it was not her business to make arrangements .::::she
Mr. Mohun had much business to transact in London which he could not leave undone , and as soon as his nephew began to recover he thought of setting off to <<target>> Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth , who had already been a week at Lady Rotherwood 's house in Grosvenor Square , which she had lent to them for the occasion .::::meet
Claude had intended to stay at home , as his cousin was not yet well enough to leave the room ; but just at this time a college friend of the <<target>> 's , hearing of his illness , wrote to propose to come and stay with him for a month or six weeks , and help him in serving his church .::::rector
Mr. Devereux was particularly glad to accept this kind offer , as it left him no longer dependent <<target>> Mr. Stephens and the Raynham curates , and set Claude at liberty for the London expedition .::::on
All was settled in the <<target>> space of one day .::::short
The very next they were to set off , and in great haste ; Lily did all she could <<target>> the regulation of the house , packed up her goods , and received the commissions of her sisters .::::for
Ada gave her six shillings , with orders to buy either a doll or a book -- the former if Eleanor did not say <<target>> was silly ; and Phyllis put into her hands a weighty crown piece , begging for as many things as it could buy .::::it
With Emily there <<target>> more difficulty .::::was
All Lily 's efforts had not availed to <<target>> her from contracting two debts at Raynham .::::prevent
More than four pounds she owed to Lily , and this she offered to pay her , giving <<target>> at the same time a list of commissions sufficient to swallow up double her quarter 's allowance .::::her
Lily , though really in want of the money for her own use , thought the debts at Raynham so serious , that <<target>> begged Emily to let her wait for payment till it was convenient , and to pay the shoemaker and dressmaker immediately .::::she
She was sorry that she should miss seeing Alethea Weston , who was to come home the next day , but she left various messages for her , and an <<target>> note , and had received a promise from her sisters that the copy of the music should be given to her the first day that they saw her .::::affectionate
Her journey afforded her much amusement , and it was not till towards the end of the day that she had much time <<target>> thinking , when , her companions being sleepily inclined , she was left to her own meditations and to a dull country .::::for
She began to revolve her own feelings towards Eleanor , and as she remembered the contempt and ingratitude she had once expressed , she <<target>> from the meeting with shame and dread , and knew that she should feel reproached by Eleanor 's wonted calmness of manner .::::shrank
And as she mused upon all that Eleanor had endured , and all that she had done , such a reverence <<target>> suffering and sacrifice took possession of her mind that she was ready to look up to her sister with awe .::::for
She began to recollect old reproofs , and found herself sitting more upright , and examining the <<target>> of the folds of her dress with some uneasiness at the thought of Eleanor 's preciseness .::::sit
In the midst of her meditations her two companions were roused by the slackening speed of the <<target>> , and starting up , informed her that they were arriving at their journey 's end .::::train
The next minute she heard her father consigning her and the umbrellas to Mr. Hawkesworth 's care , and all was bewilderment till she found <<target>> in the hall of her aunt 's house , receiving as warm and affectionate a greeting from Eleanor as Emily herself could have bestowed .::::herself
'Asleep , but you shall see <<target>> ; and how is Ada ?::::him
why , Claude , <<target>> well you look !::::how
Never had Lily heard Eleanor say so much in a breath , or seen her eye so bright , or her smile so <<target>> , yet , when she entered the drawing- room , she saw that Mrs. Hawkesworth was still the Eleanor of old .::::ready
In contrast with the splendid furniture of the apartments , a pile of shirts was on the <<target>> , Eleanor 's well-known work-basket on the floor , and the ceaseless knitting close at hand .::::table
Much news was exchanged in the few minutes that elapsed before Eleanor carried off her sister to her room , indulging her by the <<target>> with a peep at little Harry , and one kiss to his round red cheek as he lay asleep in his little bed .::::way
It was not Eleanor 's fault that she did not entirely dress Lily , and unpack her wardrobe ; but Lilias liked to show that <<target>> could manage for herself ; and Eleanor 's praise of her neat arrangements gave her as much pleasure as in days of yore .::::she
The evening passed <<target>> happily .::::very
Eleanor 's heart was open , she was full of enjoyment at meeting those she loved , and the two <<target>> sat long together in the twilight , talking over numerous subjects , all ending in Beechcroft or the baby .::::sisters
Yet when Lily awoke the next morning her awe of Eleanor began to <<target>> , and she felt like a child just returned to school .::::return
She was , however , mistaken ; Eleanor assumed no authority , she treated Lily as her <<target>> , and thus made her feel more like a woman than she had ever done before .::::equal
Lily thought either that Eleanor was much altered , or that in her folly <<target>> must have fancied her far more cold and grave than she really was .::::she
She had , however , no time for studying her character ; shopping and sight-seeing filled up most <<target>> her time , and the remainder was spent in resting , and in playing with little Henry .::::of
Lily was very tired , but she worked steadily at marking Eleanor 's pocket-handkerchiefs , until <<target>> sister , seeing how weary she was , made her lie down on the sofa .::::her
'It is quite bedtime , ' said Eleanor , in <<target>> decided tone , and she carried him off .::::her
Lilias took up the knitting which she had laid <<target>> , and began to study the stitches .::::down
' I should like this feathery pattern , ' said she , ' ( if it did not remind me so <<target>> of the fever ) ; but , by the bye , Frank , have you completed Master Henry 's outfit ?::::much
'Why , Lily , did not you know <<target>> he was to stay in England ? '::::that
At this moment Eleanor returned , and Mr. Hawkesworth told her he had been <<target>> to find Lily did not know their intentions with regard to the baby .::::surprised
'If we had any certain intentions we should have told her , ' said Eleanor ; ' I <<target>> not wish to speak to her about it till we had made up our minds . '::::did
'Well , I know no use in mysteries , ' said Mr. <<target>> , 'especially when Lily may help us to decide . '::::hawkesworth
'On his going <<target>> staying ? '::::or
exclaimed Lily , eagerly looking to Mr. Hawkesworth , who <<target>> evidently more disposed to speak than his wife .::::was
'Not on his going or staying -- I am sorry to say that <<target>> was settled long ago -- but where we shall leave him . '::::point
Lily 's heart beat high , <<target>> she did not speak .::::but
'The truth is , ' proceeded Mr. Hawkesworth , 'that this young gentleman has , as <<target>> you know , a grandpapa , a grandmamma , and also six or seven aunts .::::perhaps
Master Henry 's other five aunts live in one great house , in a delightful country , with nothing to do but make much of him all day long , yet it is <<target>> that these said aunts are a parcel of giddy young colts , amongst whom , if Henry escapes being demolished as a baby he will infallibly be spoilt as he grows up .::::averred
Now , how are <<target>> to decide ? '::::we
'You have heard the true state of the <<target>> , Lily , ' said Mrs. Hawkesworth .::::case
' I did not wish to harass papa by speaking to him till something <<target>> settled ; you are certainly old enough to have an opinion . '::::was
'Yes , Lily , ' said Frank ; 'do you think that the hospitable New Court will open to <<target>> our poor deserted child , and that these said aunts are not wild colts but discreet damsels ? '::::receive
Playful as Mr. Hawkesworth 's manner was , Lily saw the earnestness that was veiled under it : she felt the <<target>> of Eleanor 's appeal , and knew that this was no time to let herself be swayed by her wishes .::::solemnity
At last , after a great struggle , Lily 's better judgment gained <<target>> mastery , and raising her head , she said , 'Oh !::::the
Frank , do not ask me -- I wish -- but , Eleanor , when <<target>> see how much harm we have done , how utterly we have failed -- '::::you
'Remember , ' said Frank , 'those who <<target>> themselves are the most trustworthy . '::::mistrust
'No , Frank , it is not only the feeling of the greatness of the charge , it is <<target>> knowledge that we are not fit for it -- that our own faults have forfeited such happiness . '::::the
Again Lily was <<target>> with tears .::::choked
At all events , one of those <<target>> is to be respected . '::::aunts
This kindness on the part of her brother-in-law , which Lily felt to be undeserved , caused her tears to flow faster , and Eleanor , seeing her quite overcome , led <<target>> out of the room , helped her to undress , and put her to bed , with tenderness such as Lily had never experienced from her , excepting in illness .::::her
No more was said on the subject , and Lily was very grateful to Eleanor <<target>> making no inquiries , which she could not have answered without blaming Emily .::::for
Sight-seeing prospered very well under Claude 's guidance , and Lily 's <<target>> and delight was a constant source of amusement to her friends .::::wonder
Her shopping was more of a care than a pleasure , for , in spite of the handsome equipments which Mr. Mohun presented to all his daughters , it was impossible <<target>> contract Emily 's requirements within the limits of what ought to be her expenditure , and the different views of her brother and sister were rather troublesome in this matter .::::to
Claude hated the search for ladies ' finery , and if drawn into it , insisted on always taking her to the grandest and most expensive shops ; while , on the other hand , <<target>> Eleanor liked to hunt up cheap things and good bargains , she had such rigid ideas about plainness of dress , that there was little chance that what she approved would satisfy Emily .::::though
'Suddenly , a mighty jerk <<target>> mighty mischief did . '::::a
In the meantime Emily and Jane went on very prosperously at home , looking forward to <<target>> return of the rest of the party on Saturday , the 17th of July .::::the
In this , however , they were doomed to disappointment , for neither Mr. Mohun <<target>> Mr. Hawkesworth could wind up their affairs so as to return before the 24th .::::nor
Maurice 's holidays commenced on Monday the 19th , and Claude offered to go home on the same <<target>> , and meet him , but in a general council it was determined to the contrary .::::day
Claude was wanted to stay for a concert on Thursday , and both Mr. Mohun and <<target>> thought Maurice , without Reginald , would not be formidable for a few days .::::eleanor
At first he seemed <<target>> justify this opinion .::::to
He did not appear to have any peculiar pursuit , unless such might be called a very earnest attempt to make Phyllis desist from her favourite preface <<target>> ' I 'll tell you what , ' and to reform her habit of saying , 'Please for , ' instead of 'If you please . '::::of
He walked with the sisters , carried messages for Mr. Devereux , performed <<target>> neat little bits of carpentry , and was very useful and agreeable .::::some
On Wednesday afternoon Lord Rotherwood and Florence called , their heads the more full of the <<target>> because the Marquis had not once thought of it while Mr. Devereux was ill .::::30th
Among the intended diversions fireworks were mentioned , and from that moment rockets , <<target>> , and serpents , commenced a wild career through Maurice 's brain .::::wheels
Through the whole evening he searched for books on what he was pleased to call the art of pyrotechnics , <<target>> them all Wednesday , and the next morning announced his intention of making some fireworks on a new plan .::::studied
'Stop him , Jane , stop <<target>> , ' cried Emily .::::him
'Nothing can be <<target>> dangerous .::::so
Tell him how angry <<target>> would be . '::::papa
Though Jane highly esteemed her brother 's discretion , she did not much like the idea of his touching <<target>> , and she ran after him to suggest that he had better wait till papa 's return .::::powder
'Then Redgie will be at home , ' said Maurice , 'and I could <<target>> be answerable for the consequence of such a careless fellow touching powder . '::::not
This great proof of caution quite satisfied Jane , but not so Wat Greenwood , who proved himself a <<target>> servant by refusing to let Master Maurice have one grain of gunpowder without express leave from the squire .::::faithful
Maurice then had recourse to Jane , and his power over her was such as to triumph over strong sense and weak notions <<target>> obedience , so that she was prevailed upon to supply him with the means of making the dangerous and forbidden purchase .::::of
Emily was both annoyed and alarmed when she found that the gunpowder was actually in the house , and she even thought of sending a note to <<target>> parsonage to beg Mr. Devereux to speak to Maurice ; but Jane had gone over to the enemy , and Emily never could do anything unsupported .::::the
Besides , she neither liked to affront Maurice nor to confess herself unable to keep him in order ; and she , therefore , tried to put the whole matter out of her head , in the <<target>> of an expedition to Raynham , which she was about to make in the manner she best liked , with Jane in the close carriage , and the horses reluctantly spared from their farm work .::::thoughts
As they were turning the corner of the lane they overtook Phyllis and Adeline on their way to the school with some work , <<target>> Emily stopped the carriage , to desire them to send off a letter which she had left on the chimney-piece in the schoolroom .::::and
Then proceeding to Raynham , they made their visits , paid Emily 's debts , performed their commissions , <<target>> met the carriage again at the bookseller 's shop , at the end of about two hours .::::and
'Look here , <<target>> ! '::::emily
'The truly charitable , ' <<target>> Emily , contemptuously .::::said
It says `` unbeneficed clergyman and deceased nobleman , '' <<target>> who can that be but Uncle Rotherwood and Mr .::::and
'Well , let us see , ' said <<target>> , 'those things are always amusing . '::::emily
It was an appeal to the 'truly charitable , ' from the friends of the widow of an unbeneficed clergyman of the diocese , one of whose sons had , it was said , <<target>> the kindness of a deceased nobleman , received the promise of an appointment in India , of which he was unable to avail himself for want of the funds needful for his outfit .::::by
F. is plainly that bustling , little , old Miss Fitchett , <<target>> wrote to papa for some subscription , ' said Emily .::::who
'You know she is a regular beggar , always doing these kind of things , but <<target>> can never believe that Mrs. Aylmer would consent to appear in this manner . '::::i
but it says without her <<target>> , ' said Jane .::::knowledge
'Do n't you remember Rotherwood 's <<target>> that they were forgotten ? '::::lamenting
'Ask Mr. Adam what he <<target>> , ' said Jane .::::knows
Emily accordingly applied to the bookseller , and learnt <<target>> Mrs. Aylmer was indeed the person intended .::::that
'Something must be done , ' <<target>> she , returning to Jane .::::said
'Our name will be <<target>> help . '::::a
'Or suppose we apply to Miss Fitchett , we <<target>> have time to drive that way . '::::should
' I am sure I shall not go to Miss Fitchett , ' <<target>> Emily , 'she only longs for an excuse to visit us .::::said
What can you <<target>> thinking of ?::::be
And Emily wrote down , 'Miss Mohun , 5 pounds , ' and handed <<target>> the bookseller all that she possessed towards paying her just debts to Lilias .::::to
While she was writing , Jane had turned towards the <<target>> , and suddenly exclaiming , 'There is Ben !::::window
darted out of <<target>> shop .::::the
She had seen the groom on horseback , and the next <<target>> she was asking breathlessly , 'Is it Maurice ? '::::moment
'No , Miss Jane ; but Miss Ada is badly <<target>> , and Master Maurice sent me to fetch Mr .::::burnt
'How did it <<target>> ? '::::happen
Emily had just arrived at the door , looking dreadfully pale , and followed by numerous kind offers of salts and glasses of water ; but Jane , perceiving that at <<target>> she had strength to get into the carriage , refused them all , helped her in , and with instant decision , desired to be driven to the surgeon 's .::::least
Emily obeyed like a child , and threw herself back in the carriage without a word ; Jane trembled like an aspen leaf ; but her higher spirit took the lead , and <<target>> sensibly she managed , stopping at Mr. Saunders 's door to offer to take him to Beechcroft , and getting a glass of sal-volatile for Emily while they were waiting for him .::::very
His presence was a great relief , for Emily 's natural courtesy made her <<target>> herself , and thus warded off much that would have been very distressing .::::exert
In the meantime we will return to Beechcroft , where Emily 's request respecting her letter had <<target>> some discussion between the little girls , as they returned from a walk with Marianne .::::occasioned
At last , Phyllis hoped the matter might be settled by asking Maurice to seal the letter , and <<target>> him at the front door , she began , in fortunately , with 'Please , Maurice -- '::::meeting
' I never listen to anything beginning with please , ' said Maurice , <<target>> was in a great hurry , 'only do n't touch my powder . '::::who
Away he went , deaf to all his sister 's shouts of 'Maurice , Maurice , ' and they went in , Ada not sorry <<target>> be unheard , as she was bent on the grand exploit of lighting a lucifer match , but Phyllis still pleading for the wafer .::::to
They found the schoolroom strewed with Maurice 's preparations for <<target>> , and Emily 's letter on the chimney-piece .::::fireworks
'Let us take the letter downstairs , and <<target>> on a wafer , ' said Phyllis .::::put
'No , the stamps are here , and so are <<target>> matches , I can do it easily . '::::the
'But Ada , Ada , <<target>> would be naughty .::::it
Only wait , and I will show you such a <<target>> wafer that I know of in the drawing-room .::::pretty
I will run and <<target>> it . '::::fetch
Phyllis went , and Ada stood a few <<target>> in doubt , looking at the letter .::::moments
The recollection of duty was not strong enough to balance the temptation , <<target>> she took up a match and drew it along the sandpaper .::::and
It did not light -- a second pull , and the flame appeared more suddenly than she had expected , while at the <<target>> moment the lock of the door turned , and fancying it was Maurice , she started , and dropped the match .::::same
Phyllis opened the door , heard a loud explosion and a <<target>> , saw a bright flash and a cloud of smoke .::::scream
She started back , but the next moment <<target>> opened the door , and ran forward .::::again
Hannah rushed in at the same time , and caught <<target>> Ada , who had fallen to the ground .::::up
The table was now one sheet of flame , and Phyllis flew to <<target>> pantry , where she gave the summons in almost inaudible tones .::::the
Phyllis ran down , calling Maurice , and at length met him at <<target>> front door , looking much frightened , and asking for Ada .::::the
Maurice , her face and neck <<target>> burnt , and badly .::::are
'Did I not tell you not <<target>> meddle with the powder ? '::::to
'Indeed , I could not help <<target>> , ' said Phyllis .::::it
It is very well that you have not killed Ada , <<target>> I think that would have made you sorry . '::::and
Phyllis with difficulty mentioned Hannah 's desire that a surgeon should be sent <<target>> : Maurice went to look for Ben , and she followed him .::::for
Then he began asking how <<target>> had done the mischief .::::she
Did you not say that <<target>> touched the powder ? '::::you
'No buts , ' said Maurice , <<target>> the most of his brief authority .::::making
' I hate <<target>> excuses .::::false
What were you doing <<target>> it exploded ? '::::when
'Coming into the <<target>> . '::::room
that accounts for it , ' said Maurice , 'the slightest vibration causes an explosion of <<target>> sort of rocket , and of course it was your bouncing into the room !::::that
You have had a lesson <<target>> rushing about the house .::::against
Do n't cry , Phyl , I will explain <<target>> you all about the patent rocket . '::::to
'But do you really think that <<target>> blew up Ada ? '::::i
caused the powder <<target>> ignite .::::to
As he spoke he followed Phyllis to the nursery , and there was so much shocked , that he could no <<target>> lord it over her , but shrinking back , shut himself up in his room , and bolted the door .::::longer
Nearly an hour passed away before the arrival <<target>> Emily , Jane , and Mr. Saunders .::::of
Phyllis ran down , and meeting them <<target>> the door , exclaimed , 'Oh !::::at
I am so <<target>> . '::::sorry
The sisters hurried past her to the nursery , where Ada was lying on the bed , half undressed , <<target>> her face , neck , and arm such a spectacle that Emily turned away , ready to faint .::::and
Mr. Saunders was summoned , and <<target>> thrust out of the room .::::phyllis
After a time she was startled by hearing herself called from the stairs BY BELOW a voice which she <<target>> not heard for many weeks , and springing up , saw Mr. Devereux leaning on the banisters .::::had
The great change in his appearance frightened her almost as much as <<target>> accident itself , and she stood looking at him without speaking .::::the
'Phyllis , ' said he , in a <<target>> hoarse with agitation , 'what is it ?::::voice
tell me at <<target>> . '::::once
She could not speak , and her wild and <<target>> air might well give him great alarm .::::frightened
'The gunpowder -- I made it go off , <<target>> it has burnt poor Ada 's face !::::and
Mr. Saunders is there , <<target>> she screams -- '::::and
She flew to the door , and listened , and then called <<target>> , 'Emily , Jane , here is Cousin Robert ! '::::out
Jane came down , leaving Emily to <<target>> hearing Mr. Saunders 's directions .::::finish
She was even more shocked at her cousin 's looks than Phyllis had been , <<target>> though she tried to speak cheerfully , her manner scarcely agreed with her words .::::and
'It is all well , Robert , I <<target>> sorry you have been so frightened .::::am
you ought not <<target>> be here .::::to
What shall we <<target>> for you ?::::do
you are quite <<target>> up . '::::knocked
no , ' said Mr. Devereux , ' <<target>> am only a little out of breath .::::i
A terrible report came to me , and <<target>> set off to learn the truth .::::i
'Only to the gate to speak to Rotherwood yesterday , and prevent him from coming <<target>> , ' said Mr. Devereux , 'but I have great designs for Sunday .::::in
They come home to-morrow , <<target>> not they ? '::::do
Jane was much relieved by hearing her cousin talk in this manner , and answered , 'Yes , <<target>> a dismal coming home it will be ; it is too late to let them know . '::::and
His gig had come from Raynham , and he offered to set Mr. Devereux down <<target>> the parsonage , a proposal which the latter was very glad to accept .::::at
Phyllis answered that Maurice said that her banging <<target>> door had made the powder go off .::::the
Jane then asked where Maurice was , and Phyllis reporting that he was in his <<target>> room , she repaired thither , and knocked twice without receiving an answer .::::own
On her call , however , he opened the door ; she saw that he <<target>> been in tears , and hastened to tell him Mr. Saunders 's opinion .::::had

More than once in the course of the night did poor Phyllis wake and cry , and the next day was the most wretched she had ever spent ; she was not allowed to stay in the nursery , and the schoolroom was uninhabitable , so she wandered listlessly about the garden , sometimes creeping <<target>> to the churchyard , where she looked up at the old tower , or pondered over the graves , and sometimes forgetting her troubles in converse with the dogs , in counting the rings in the inside of a foxglove flower , or in rescuing tadpoles stranded on the broad leaf of a water-lily .::::down
Her sisters and brothers <<target>> not less forlorn .::::were
Ada whined , fretted , and was disobedient , and from Maurice she met with nothing but rebuffs ; he was silent and sullen , and spent most <<target>> the day in the workshop , slowly planing scraps of deal board , and watching with a careless eye the curled shavings float to the ground .::::of
In the course of the afternoon Alethea and <<target>> came to inquire after the patient .::::marianne
Jane came down to them and talked very fast , but when they asked for a further explanation of the cause of the accident , Jane declared that Maurice said <<target>> was impossible that any one who did not understand chemistry should know how it happened , and Alethea went away strongly reminded that it was no affair of hers .::::it

The travellers were expected to arrive at about seven o'clock in the evening , and in accordance with a well-known <<target>> of Eleanor 's , Emily had ordered no dinner , but a substantial meal under the name of tea .::::taste
When the sound of carriage wheels was heard , Jane was with Adeline , Maurice was in his retreat <<target>> the Old Court , and it was with no cheerful alacrity that Emily went alone into the hall .::::at
Phyllis was already at the front door , and the instant Mr. Mohun set foot on the threshold , her hand grasped his coat , <<target>> her shrill voice cried in his ear , 'Papa , I am very sorry I blew up the gunpowder and burnt Ada . '::::and
I blew up the gunpowder and burnt <<target>> face , ' repeated Phyllis .::::her
'We have had an accident , ' said Emily , 'but I hope it <<target>> nothing very serious , only poor Ada is a sad figure . '::::is

The worst was over with Phyllis <<target>> the confession had been made .::::when
Phyllis turned , and came down slowly in her most ungainly manner , believing herself in too great disgrace to be noticed <<target>> anybody , and she was quite surprised and comforted to be greeted by her brothers and Lily just as usual .::::by

The rain had only ceased with the gray streaks of morning at Blazing Star , and the settlement awoke to a moral sense of cleanliness , and the finding <<target>> forgotten knives , tin cups , and smaller camp utensils , where the heavy showers had washed away the debris and dust heaps before the cabin doors .::::of
Indeed , it was recorded in Blazing Star that a fortunate early riser had once picked up on the highway a solid <<target>> of gold quartz which the rain had freed from its incumbering soil , and washed into immediate and glittering popularity .::::chunk
Possibly this may have been the reason why early risers in that locality , during the rainy season , adopted <<target>> thoughtful habit of body , and seldom lifted their eyes to the rifted or india-ink washed skies above them .::::a
A leak in his cabin roof , -- quite consistent with his careless , improvident habits , -- <<target>> roused him at 4 A. M. , with a flooded `` bunk '' and wet blankets .::::had
Something glittered in the nearest <<target>> pool before him .::::red
Looking at it more attentively , he saw that it <<target>> the inscription , `` May to Cass . ''::::bore
It fitted his <<target>> finger closely .::::little
It was evidently a <<target>> 's ring .::::woman
He looked up and <<target>> the highway .::::down
No one was <<target>> stirring .::::yet
Little pools of water in the red road were beginning to glitter and grow rosy from <<target>> far-flushing east , but there was no trace of the owner of the shining waif .::::the
He knew that there was no woman in camp , and among his few comrades <<target>> the settlement he remembered to have seen none wearing an ornament like that .::::in
Again , the coincidence of the inscription to his rather peculiar nickname would have been a <<target>> source of playful comment in a camp that made no allowance for sentimental memories .::::perennial
He slipped the glittering little hoop into his <<target>> , and thoughtfully returned to his cabin .::::pocket
`` Ye did n't none on ye happen <<target>> drop anything round yer last night ? ''::::to
`` I dropped a pocketbook containing government bonds and some other securities , with between fifty and sixty thousand dollars , '' responded Peter Drummond , carelessly ; `` but no matter , if <<target>> man will return a few autograph letters from foreign potentates that happened to be in it , -- of no value to anybody but the owner , -- he can keep the money .::::any
This statement , bearing every evidence of the grossest mendacity , was lightly <<target>> over , and the men walked on with the deepest gravity .::::passed
`` But hev <<target>> ? ''::::you
Cass presently asked <<target>> another .::::of
`` I lost my pile to Jack Hamlin at draw-poker , over at Wingdam last night , '' returned <<target>> other , pensively , `` but I do n't calkilate to find it lying round loose . ''::::the
The result was a dozen vague surmises , -- only one of which seemed to be popular , and to <<target>> the dyspeptic despondency of the party , -- a despondency born of hastily masticated fried pork and flapjacks .::::suit
The ring was believed to have been dropped by some <<target>> `` road agent '' laden with guilty spoil .::::passing
I 've seen better men nor you strung up a tree by <<target>> for having even less than that in their possession . ''::::vigilantes
With this the men sadly dispersed , leaving the innocent Cass with the ring in his hand , and a general impression on his mind that he was already an <<target>> of suspicion to his comrades , -- an impression , it is hardly necessary to say , they fully intended should be left to rankle in his guileless bosom .::::object
Notwithstanding Cass 's first hopeful superstition the ring did not <<target>> to bring him nor the camp any luck .::::seem
Daily the `` clean up '' brought the same scant rewards to <<target>> labors , and deepened the sardonic gravity of Blazing Star .::::their
But , if Cass found no material result from his treasure , it stimulated his lazy imagination , and , albeit a dangerous and <<target>> stimulant , at least lifted him out of the monotonous grooves of his half-careless , half-slovenly , but always self-contented camp life .::::seductive
Heeding the wise caution of his comrades , he took <<target>> habit of wearing the ring only at night .::::the
Whether it ever evoked any warmer dream or vision during those calm , cold , virgin-like spring nights , when <<target>> the moon and the greater planets retreated into the icy blue , steel-like firmament , I can not say .::::even
Enough that this superstition began to be colored a little <<target>> fancy , and his fatalism somewhat mitigated by hope .::::by
`` I 'm dog-goned , '' said one commentator , `` ef I <<target>> n't believe that Cass is looney over that yer ring he found .::::do

Meantime , the seasons did not <<target>> the discovery of the secret .::::wait
The red pools in Blazing Star highway were soon dried up in <<target>> fervent June sun and riotous night wind of those altitudes .::::the
The ephemeral grasses that had quickly supplanted these pools and <<target>> chocolate-colored mud , were as quickly parched and withered .::::the
The footprints of spring became vague and indefinite , and were <<target>> lost in the impalpable dust of the summer highway .::::finally
In one of his long , aimless excursions , Cass had penetrated a thick undergrowth of buckeye <<target>> hazel , and found himself quite unexpectedly upon the high road to Red Chief 's Crossing .::::and
Cass knew by the lurid cloud of dust that hid <<target>> distance , that the up coach had passed .::::the
He had already reached that stage of superstition when the most trivial occurrence seemed <<target>> point in some way to an elucidation of the mystery of his treasure .::::to
His eyes had mechanically fallen to the ground again , as if he half <<target>> to find in some other waif a hint or corroboration of his imaginings .::::expected
Thus abstracted , the figure of a young girl on horseback , in the road directly <<target>> the bushes he emerged from , appeared to have sprung directly from the ground .::::before
`` Oh , come here , <<target>> do ; quick ! ''::::please
Cass stared , and then <<target>> hesitatingly toward her .::::moved
It 's something too <<target>> for anything . ''::::awful
In spite of this appalling introduction , Cass could not but notice that the voice , although hurried and excited , was <<target>> no means agitated or frightened ; that the eyes which looked into his sparkled with a certain kind of pleased curiosity .::::by
`` It was just here , '' she went on vivaciously , `` just here that I went into the bush and cut a switch for my <<target>> , -- and , '' -- leading him along at a brisk trot by her side , -- '' just here , look , see !::::mare
this is what <<target>> found . ''::::i
It was scarcely thirty <<target>> from the road .::::feet
The only object that met Cass 's eye was a man 's <<target>> , tall hat , lying emptily and vacantly in the grass .::::stiff
But it was so incongruous , so perkily smart , and yet so feeble and helpless lying there , so ghastly ludicrous in its very appropriateness and incapacity to <<target>> itself to the surrounding landscape , that it affected him with something more than a sense of its grotesqueness , and he could only stare at it blankly .::::adjust
`` But you 're not looking the right way , '' <<target>> girl went on sharply ; `` look there ! ''::::the
Cass followed the direction <<target>> her whip .::::of
At last , what might have seemed a coat thrown carelessly on the ground met his eye , but presently he became aware of a white , rigid , aimlessly-clinched hand protruding from the flaccid sleeve ; <<target>> with it in some absurd way and half hidden by the grass , lay what might have been a pair of cast-off trousers but for two rigid boots that pointed in opposite angles to the sky .::::mingled
It was a <<target>> man .::::dead
So palpably dead that life seemed to <<target>> taken flight from his very clothes .::::have
So impotent , feeble , and degraded by them that the naked <<target>> of a dissecting table would have been less insulting to humanity .::::subject
Indeed , one limp hand that lay across the swollen abdomen lent itself to the <<target>> hideous suggestion of a gentleman sleeping off the excesses of a hearty dinner .::::grotesquely
`` Ai n't <<target>> horrid ? ''::::he
continued the girl ; `` <<target>> what killed him ? ''::::but
Struggling between a certain fascination at the girl 's cold-blooded curiosity and <<target>> of the murdered man , Cass hesitatingly lifted the helpless head .::::horror
A bluish hole above the right temple , and a few brown paint-like spots <<target>> the forehead , shirt cellar , and matted hair proved the only record .::::on
`` Turn him over again , '' said the girl , <<target>> , as Cass was about to relinquish his burden .::::impatiently
`` May be you 'll <<target>> another wound . ''::::find
But Cass was dimly remembering certain formalities that in older civilizations attend <<target>> discovery of dead bodies , and postponed a present inquest .::::the
I do n't mind <<target>> a witness .::::being
Or , '' she added , without heeding Cass 's look of <<target>> , `` I 'll wait here till you come back . ''::::astonishment
`` But you see , Miss , it <<target>> n't seem right -- '' began Cass .::::would
`` But I found him first , '' <<target>> the girl , with a pout .::::interrupted
Staggered by this preemptive right , sacred <<target>> all miners , Cass stopped .::::to
`` Who is <<target>> coroner ? ''::::the
`` The tall , lame man , who <<target>> half eaten by a grizzly ? ''::::was
`` Well , <<target>> now !::::look
I 'll ride on and bring <<target>> back in half an hour .::::him
`` But , <<target>> -- ! ''::::miss
I never saw anything of this kind before , <<target>> I want to see it ALL . ''::::and
`` Do you <<target>> Hornsby ? ''::::know
asked Cass , unconsciously <<target>> trifle irritated .::::a
She wheeled her horse <<target>> the road .::::into
In the presence of this living energy <<target>> quite forgot the helpless dead .::::cass
`` Have you been long in <<target>> parts , Miss ? ''::::these
`` Good-by , <<target>> now .::::just
Look around for the pistol or anything else you can find , <<target>> I have been over the whole ground twice already . ''::::although
A little puff of dust as the horse sprang into the road , a muffled <<target>> , struggle , then the regular beat of hoofs , and she was gone .::::shuffle
After five minutes had passed , Cass regretted that he had not <<target>> her ; waiting in such a spot was an irksome task .::::accompanied
Not that there was anything in the scene itself to awaken gloomy imaginings ; the <<target>> , truthful Californian sunshine scoffed at any illusion of creeping shadows or waving branches .::::bright
Once , in the rising wind , the empty hat rolled <<target>> -- but only in a ludicrous , drunken way .::::over
A search for any further sign or token <<target>> proved futile , and Cass grew impatient .::::had
Nor was his good humor restored when at the close of a weary half hour <<target>> galloping figures emerged from the dusty horizon -- Hornsby and the young girl .::::two
His vague annoyance increased as he fancied that both seemed to ignore <<target>> , the coroner barely acknowledging his presence with a nod .::::him
Assisted by the young girl , whose energy and enthusiasm evidently delighted <<target>> , Hornsby raised the body for a more careful examination .::::him
The dead man 's <<target>> were carefully searched .::::pockets
A few coins , a silver pencil , <<target>> , and tobacco-box were all they found .::::knife
It gave no clew <<target>> his identity .::::to
Suddenly the young girl , who had , with unabashed curiosity , knelt beside <<target>> exploring official hands of the Red Chief , uttered a cry of gratification .::::the
It dropped from the bosom of <<target>> shirt on the ground .::::his
She was holding in the air , between her thumb <<target>> forefinger , a folded bit of well-worn newspaper .::::and
`` Shall I <<target>> it ? ''::::open
`` It 's a little ring '' she <<target>> ; `` looks like an engagement ring .::::said
Something is written <<target>> it .::::on
`` It 's mine , '' <<target>> stammered , `` mine !::::he
It 's nothing -- nothing , '' he went on , after a pause , embarrassed and <<target>> , as the girl and her companion both stared at him -- '' a mere trifle .::::blushing
I 'll take <<target>> . ''::::it
But the coroner opposed <<target>> outstretched hand .::::his
`` Not much , '' <<target>> said , significantly .::::he
`` But it 's MINE , '' continued Cass , <<target>> taking the place of shame at his discovered secret .::::indignation
`` I found it six <<target>> ago in the road .::::months
I -- picked <<target>> up . ''::::it
`` With your name <<target>> written on it !::::already
`` It 's an old story '' said Cass , blushing <<target>> under the half-mischievous , half-searching eyes of the girl .::::again
`` All Blazing Star knows <<target>> found it . ''::::i
`` Just now , however , WE 'VE found it , <<target>> we propose to keep it for the inquest . ''::::and
Further altercation would have only heightened his <<target>> situation in the girl 's eyes .::::ludicrous
He turned away , leaving his <<target>> in the coroner 's hands .::::treasure
The inquest , a day or two <<target>> , was prompt and final .::::later
But much publicity and interest were given to the proceedings by <<target>> presence of the principal witness , a handsome girl .::::the
No one who was present at the inquest failed to be <<target>> with the appearance and conduct of this beautiful young lady .::::charmed
`` Miss Porter has but lately arrived in this district , in which , it is hoped , she will become an <<target>> resident , and continue to set an example to all lackadaisical and sentimental members of the so-called 'sterner sex . ' ''::::honored
After this universally recognized allusion to Cass Beard , the `` Recorder '' returned to its record : `` Some interest was excited <<target>> what appeared to be a clew to the mystery in the discovery of a small gold engagement ring on the body .::::by
Evidence was afterward offered to show it was the property of a Mr. Cass Beard of Blazing <<target>> , who appeared upon the scene AFTER the discovery of the corpse by Miss Porter .::::star
He alleged he had dropped it in <<target>> the unfortunate remains of the deceased .::::lifting
It appearing , however , by the admission of this sighing Strephon of the Foot hills , that he had himself FOUND this pledge of affection lying <<target>> the highway six months previous , the coroner wisely placed it in the safe-keeping of the county court until the appearance of the rightful owner . ''::::in
Thus on the 13th of September , 186- , the treasure found <<target>> Blazing Star passed out of the hands of its finder .::::at
Autumn brought an abrupt <<target>> of the mystery .::::explanation
Kanaka Joe had been arrested for horse stealing , but had <<target>> noble candor confessed to the finer offense of manslaughter .::::with
That swift and sure justice which overtook the horse stealer in these altitudes was <<target>> a moment and hesitated , for the victim was clearly the mysterious unknown .::::stayed
Curiosity got the better of <<target>> extempore judge and jury .::::an
`` It was a fair fight , '' said the accused , not without some human vanity , feeling that the <<target>> hung upon his words , `` and was settled by the man az was peartest and liveliest with his weapon .::::camp
We had a clinch and a stamp around , and when we <<target>> separated it was only a question of shootin ' on sight .::::was
I drawed when I sighted <<target>> , and called out .::::him
He slipped from his mare and covered himself with her flanks , reaching for his holster , but she rared and backed <<target>> on him across the road and into the grass , where I got in another shot and fetched him . ''::::down
`` And you stole <<target>> mare ? ''::::his
`` I got away , '' <<target>> the gambler , simply .::::said
Further questioning only elicited the fact that Joe did <<target>> know the name or condition of his victim .::::not
He was a <<target>> in Lagrange .::::stranger
The suggestion that Joe should be first hanged for horse stealing and then tried for murder was angrily discussed , but <<target>> counsels were offered -- that the fact of the killing should be admitted only as proof of the theft .::::milder
A large party from Red Chief had come over <<target>> assist in judgment , among them the coroner .::::to
Cass Beard had avoided these proceedings , which only recalled an unpleasant experience , <<target>> was wandering with pick , pan , and wallet far from the camp .::::and
These accoutrements , as I have before intimated , justified any form <<target>> aimless idleness under the equally aimless title of `` prospecting . ''::::of
He had at the end of three hours ' relaxation reached the highway to Red Chief , half hidden by <<target>> clouds of dust torn from the crumbling red road at every gust which swept down the mountain side .::::blinding
The spot had a familiar aspect to Cass , although some freshly-dug holes near the <<target>> , with scattered earth beside them , showed the presence of a recent prospector .::::wayside
He was struggling with his memory , when the dust was suddenly <<target>> and he found himself again at the scene of the murder .::::dispersed
He started : he had not put <<target>> on the road since the inquest .::::foot
There lacked only the helpless dead man and the contrasting <<target>> of the alert young woman to restore the picture .::::figure
The body was gone , it was true , but as he turned he beheld Miss Porter , at a <<target>> paces distant , sitting on her horse as energetic and observant as on the first morning they had met .::::few
A superstitious thrill passed over him <<target>> awoke his old antagonism .::::and
She nodded to <<target>> slightly .::::him
`` I came here to refresh my memory , '' she said , `` as Mr. <<target>> thought I might be asked to give my evidence again at Blazing Star . ''::::hornsby
Cass carelessly struck an aimless blow with his <<target>> against the sod and did not reply .::::pick
`` I stumbled upon the place just now while <<target>> , or I should n't be here . ''::::prospecting
`` Then it was YOU <<target>> these holes ? ''::::made
`` No , '' said <<target>> , with ill-concealed disgust .::::cass
`` Nobody but a stranger would go <<target>> ' round such a spot . ''::::foolin
He stopped , as the rude significance of his speech struck him , and <<target>> surlily , `` I mean -- no one would dig here . ''::::added
The girl laughed and showed a set of <<target>> white teeth in her square jaw .::::very
`` Do you mean to say that every miner does n't know that <<target>> 's lucky to dig wherever human blood has been spilt ? ''::::it
`` And you call yourself <<target>> California miner ? ''::::a
It was impossible for Miss Porter to <<target>> his curt speech and unsocial manner .::::misunderstand
She stared at him <<target>> colored slightly .::::and
Lifting her reins lightly , she said : `` You certainly do <<target>> seem like most of the miners I have met . ''::::not
`` Nor you like any girl from the <<target>> I ever met , '' he responded .::::east
`` What do <<target>> mean ? ''::::you
she asked , <<target>> her horse .::::checking
Reasonable as this reply was , it immediately struck <<target>> that it was scarcely dignified or manly .::::him
But before he could explain <<target>> Miss Porter was gone .::::himself
He met her again <<target>> very evening .::::that
The trial had been summarily suspended by the appearance of the Sheriff of Calaveras and his posse , who took <<target>> from that self-constituted tribunal of Blazing Star and set his face southward and toward authoritative although more cautious justice .::::joe
It is said the prisoner burst into an incredulous <<target>> and asked to see this mysterious waif .::::laugh
It was handed <<target>> him .::::to
Standing in the very shadow of the gallows tree -- which might have been one of the pines that sheltered the billiard room in which the Vigilance Committee <<target>> their conclave -- the prisoner gave way to a burst of merriment , so genuine and honest that the judge and jury joined in automatic sympathy .::::held
When silence was restored an explanation <<target>> asked by the Judge .::::was
But there was no response from <<target>> prisoner except a subdued chuckle .::::the
`` Did this ring <<target>> to you ? ''::::belong
asked the Judge , severely , the jury and spectators craning <<target>> ears forward with an expectant smile already on their faces .::::their
But the prisoner 's eyes only sparkled <<target>> as he looked around the court .::::maliciously
`` Tell us , Joe , '' said a <<target>> and laughter-loving juror , under his breath .::::sympathetic
`` Let it out and we 'll <<target>> it easy for you . ''::::make
`` Prisoner , '' said the Judge , with a return of <<target>> dignity , `` remember that your life is in peril .::::official
And as it was here that the Sheriff of Calaveras made <<target>> precipitate entry into the room , the mystery remained unsolved .::::a
The effect of this freshly-important ridicule on the sensitive mind of Cass might have <<target>> foretold by Blazing Star had it ever taken that sensitiveness into consideration .::::been
He had lost the good humor and easy pliability which had tempted <<target>> to frankness , and he had gradually become bitter and hard .::::him
He had at first affected amusement over his own vanished day dream -- hiding his virgin disappointment in his <<target>> breast ; but when he began to turn upon his feelings he turned upon his comrades also .::::own
Cass was for <<target>> while unpopular .::::a
There is no ingratitude so revolting to the human mind as <<target>> of the butt who refuses to be one any longer .::::that
The man who rejects that immunity which laughter generally casts upon <<target>> and demands to be seriously considered deserves no mercy .::::him
It was his habit usually to ride with the driver , but the <<target>> of Hornsby and Miss Porter on the box seat changed his intention .::::presence
Yet he had the satisfaction of seeing that neither had noticed him , and as there was no other <<target>> inside , he stretched himself on the cushion of the back seat and gave way to moody reflections .::::passenger
He quite determined to leave Blazing Star , to settle himself seriously to the task of money getting , and to return <<target>> his comrades , some day , a sarcastic , cynical , successful man , and so overwhelm them with confusion .::::to
For poor Cass had not yet reached that superiority of knowing <<target>> success would depend upon his ability to forego his past .::::that
Indeed , part of his boyhood had been cast among these men , and he was <<target>> old enough to have learned that success was not to be gauged by their standard .::::not
The moon lit up the dark interior of <<target>> coach with a faint poetic light .::::the
He dreamed with <<target>> eyes open .::::his
From an Alnaschar vision <<target>> suddenly awoke .::::he
The voices of men , one in entreaty , <<target>> in expostulation , came from the box .::::one

It was Miss <<target>> 's voice .::::porter
This was followed by a rapid , half-restrained <<target>> of words between Hornsby and the driver .::::interchange

But Miss Porter had <<target>> into the coach .::::jumped
Hornsby placed his hand on <<target>> handle of the door .::::the
Miss Porter grasped it <<target>> from the inside .::::firmly
There was a <<target>> struggle .::::slight
All of which was part of <<target>> dream to the boyish Cass .::::a
But he awoke from <<target>> -- a man !::::it
`` Do you , '' he asked , in a voice he scarcely <<target>> himself , -- '' Do you want this man inside ? ''::::recognized
Cass caught at Hornsby 's <<target>> like a young tiger .::::wrist
what availed instinctive chivalry <<target>> main strength ?::::against
He only succeeded in forcing the door open in spite of Miss Porter 's superior strategy , and -- I fear I must <<target>> , muscle also -- and threw himself passionately at Hornsby 's throat , where he hung on and calmly awaited dissolution .::::add
But he had , in the onset , driven <<target>> out into the road and the moonlight .::::hornsby
Somebody take my <<target>> . ''::::lines
The figure that jumped from the box and separated <<target>> struggling men belonged to this singularly direct person .::::the
`` You 're <<target>> inside ? ''::::riding
Charley promptly bundled Cass <<target>> the coach .::::into
to Hornsby , `` onless you 're kalkilatin ' to <<target>> a little 'pasear ' you 're booked OUTSIDE .::::take
It is probable that Charley assisted Mr. Hornsby as promptly to his <<target>> , for the next moment the coach was rolling on .::::seat
Meanwhile Cass , by reason of his forced entry , had been deposited in Miss Porter 's lap , whence , freeing himself , he had attempted to climb over the middle seat , <<target>> in the starting of the coach was again thrown heavily against her hat and shoulder ; all of which was inconsistent with the attitude of dignified reserve he had intended to display .::::but
Miss Porter , meanwhile , <<target>> her good humor .::::recovered
`` What a brute he <<target>> , ugh ! ''::::was
she said , retying the ribbons of her bonnet under <<target>> square chin , and smoothing out her linen duster .::::her
Cass tried to look as if <<target>> had forgotten the whole affair .::::he
Oh , yes <<target>> see ! ''::::i
`` I suppose I ought to thank you , '' she went on with a smile , `` but you <<target>> , really , I could have kept him out if you had n't pulled his wrist from outside .::::know
Put your hand on <<target>> handle there !::::the
Now , I 'll hold <<target>> lock inside firmly .::::the
She indeed held <<target>> lock fast .::::the
It was a firm hand , yet soft -- their fingers had <<target>> over the handle -- and looked white in the moonlight .::::touched
He made no reply , but sank back again in his seat <<target>> a singular sensation in the fingers that had touched hers .::::with
It struck him that he had <<target>> really seen her before .::::never
She was not so tall as <<target>> had appeared to be .::::she
She had an indistinctive nose , a rather colorless face -- whiter at the angles <<target>> the mouth and nose through the relief of tiny freckles like grains of pepper .::::of
Her mouth was straight , dark , <<target>> , but moist as her eyes .::::red
She had drawn herself into the corner of the back seat , her wrist put through and hanging over the swinging <<target>> , the easy lines of her plump figure swaying from side to side with the motion of the coach .::::strap
Finally , forgetful of any presence in the dark corner opposite , she threw her head a little farther back , <<target>> a trifle lower , and placing two well-booted feet upon the middle seat , completed a charming and wholesome picture .::::slipped
She was looking straight <<target>> the moon .::::at
Cass Beard felt his dignified reserve <<target>> very much like awkwardness .::::becoming
He ought to <<target>> coldly polite .::::be
`` I hope you 're not flustered , Miss , <<target>> the -- by the -- '' he began .::::by
She straightened herself up in the seat , cast a curious glance into the dark corner , <<target>> then , letting herself down again , said : `` Oh , dear , no ! ''::::and
She had evidently <<target>> him .::::forgotten
He took refuge again <<target>> his reserve .::::in
But it was now mixed <<target>> a certain pique .::::with
Yet how much softer her <<target>> looked in the moonlight !::::face
Even her square jaw had lost that hard , matter-of-fact , practical indication which was <<target>> distasteful to him , and always had suggested a harsh criticism of his weakness .::::so
How moist her eyes were -- <<target>> shining in the light !::::actually
How that light seemed to concentrate in the corner of the <<target>> , and then slipped -- a flash -- away !::::lashes
Yes , she <<target>> crying .::::was
Miss Porter put her head out of the window <<target>> drew it back in a moment , dry-eyed .::::and
I never before met any one <<target>> was rude to me .::::who
I have traveled all over the country alone , and with <<target>> kinds of people ever since I was so high .::::all
I have always gone my own <<target>> , without hindrance or trouble .::::way
I like to see all <<target>> there is to see .::::that
Because I 'm a girl I do n't see why I can not go out without a keeper , <<target>> why I can not do what any man can do that is n't wrong , do you ?::::and
Perhaps you do -- <<target>> you do n't .::::perhaps
Perhaps you like a girl to be always in the <<target>> dawdling or thumping a piano or reading novels .::::house
Perhaps you think I 'm bold because I do n't like <<target>> , and wo n't lie and say I do . ''::::it
She spoke sharply and aggressively , and so evidently in answer to Cass 's unspoken <<target>> against her , that he was not surprised when she became more direct .::::indictment
`` You know you were shocked when I went to fetch that <<target>> , the coroner , after we found the dead body . ''::::hornsby
`` Hornsby was n't shocked , '' <<target>> Cass , a little viciously .::::said
`` What do <<target>> mean ? ''::::you
`` You were good <<target>> enough until -- ''::::friends
`` Until he insulted me just <<target>> , is that it ? ''::::now
`` Until he thought , '' stammered Cass , `` that because you were -- you know -- <<target>> so -- so -- so careful as other girls , he could be a little freer . ''::::not
`` And so , because I preferred to ride a mile with him to see something real that had happened , <<target>> tried to be useful instead of looking in shop windows in Main Street or promenading before the hotel -- ''::::and
But this feeble and un-Cass-like attempt at <<target>> gallantry met with a sudden check .::::playful
Miss Porter drew herself together , <<target>> looked out of the window .::::and
`` Do you wish me to walk <<target>> rest of the way home ? ''::::the
`` No , '' said Cass , hurriedly , with <<target>> crimson face and a sense of gratuitous rudeness .::::a
`` Then stop that kind of <<target>> , right there ! ''::::talk
There was an <<target>> silence .::::awkward
`` I wish I was a man , '' <<target>> said , half bitterly , half earnestly .::::she
Cass Beard was not old and cynical enough to observe that this devout aspiration is usually uttered by those who have least reason to deplore their own femininity ; and , but for the rebuff he had just received , would have made the <<target>> emphatic dissent of our sex , when the wish is uttered by warm red lips and tender voices -- a dissent , it may be remarked , generally withheld , however , when the masculine spinster dwells on the perfection of woman .::::usual
I dare say Miss Porter was sincere , <<target>> a moment later she continued , poutingly :::::for
`` And yet I used to go to fires <<target>> Sacramento when I was only ten years old .::::in
I saw the <<target>> burnt down .::::theatre
Nobody found fault with <<target>> then . ''::::me
Something made Cass ask if her father <<target>> mother objected to her boyish tastes .::::and
The reply was characteristic <<target>> not satisfactory , --::::if
I 'd like to see <<target>> do it . ''::::them
The direction of the <<target>> had changed .::::road
The fickle moon now abandoned Miss Porter and <<target>> out Cass on the front seat .::::sought
`` What 's the matter <<target>> your neck ? ''::::with
Cass looked down , blushing to find that the collar of <<target>> smart `` duck '' sailor shirt was torn open .::::his
But something more than his white , soft , girlish skin was exposed ; the <<target>> front was dyed quite red with blood from a slight cut on the shoulder .::::shirt
He remembered to have felt a <<target>> while struggling with Hornsby .::::scratch
The girl 's <<target>> eyes sparkled .::::soft
`` Let ME , '' <<target>> said , vivaciously .::::she
I 'm good <<target>> wounds .::::at
I 'll come over <<target>> you . ''::::to
She did , bestriding the back of the <<target>> seat and dropping at his side .::::middle
The magnetic fingers again touched his ; he felt her <<target>> breath on his neck as she bent toward him .::::warm
A stinging sensation as she bathed the edges of the cut <<target>> the spirit brought him back to common sense again .::::with
`` There , '' she said , skillfully extemporizing a <<target>> from her handkerchief and a compress from his cravat .::::bandage
She insisted upon buttoning it for him ; greater even than the feminine <<target>> in a man 's strength is the ministration to his weakness .::::delight
Later she even exempted her mother from <<target>> possession of this divine effluence .::::the
After a moment she asked , suddenly , `` <<target>> are you going to do with Hornsby ? ''::::what
Cass had not <<target>> of him .::::thought
His short-lived rage was past with <<target>> occasion that provoked it .::::the
Without any fear of his adversary he would have been <<target>> and quite willing to meet him no more .::::content
He only said , `` That <<target>> depend upon him . ''::::will
`` Oh , you wo n't hear from him again , '' said she , <<target>> , `` but you really ought to get up a little more muscle .::::confidently
You 've no more <<target>> a girl . ''::::than
She stopped , <<target>> little confused .::::a
`` What shall I do <<target>> your handkerchief ? ''::::with
asked the uneasy Cass , <<target>> to change the subject .::::anxious
Seeing signs of distress in his face , she <<target>> : `` Of course that was all nonsense .::::added
If you had cared so much for the ring you <<target>> n't have talked about it , or shown it .::::could
It relieved him to think that this might be true ; <<target>> certainly had not looked at it in that light before .::::he
`` But did you <<target>> find it ? ''::::really
she asked , <<target>> sudden gravity .::::with
`` Really , <<target>> ? ''::::now
`` And there was no real <<target>> in the case ? ''::::may
But Miss Porter , after eying him critically for a <<target>> jumped up and climbed back again to her seat .::::moment
`` Perhaps you had better give <<target>> that handkerchief back . ''::::me
Cass began to <<target>> his coat .::::unbutton
Do you want to take <<target>> death of cold ? ''::::your
And Cass , to avoid this direful possibility , rebuttoned his <<target>> again over the handkerchief and a peculiarly pleasing sensation .::::coat
Very little now was said until the rattling , bounding <<target>> of the coach denoted the approach to Red Chief .::::descent
The straggling main street disclosed <<target>> , light by light .::::itself
In the flash of glittering windows and the sound of eager voices Miss Porter descended , without <<target>> for Cass 's proffered assistance , and anticipated Mountain Charley 's descent from the box .::::waiting
A few undistinguishable words <<target>> between them .::::passed
`` You kin freeze to me , Miss , '' said Charley ; and Miss Porter , turning her <<target>> laugh and frankly opened palm to Cass , half returned the pressure of his hand and slipped away .::::frank
A few days after the stage coach incident , Mountain Charley drew up beside <<target>> on the Blazing Star turnpike , and handed him a small packet .::::cass
`` I was told to give <<target>> that by Miss Porter .::::ye
It 's that rather old dog-goned ring o ' <<target>> that 's bin in all the papers .::::yours
She 's bamboozled that sap-headed county judge , <<target>> , into givin ' it to her .::::boompointer
Take my advice and sling it away for some <<target>> feller to pick up and get looney over .::::other
`` Did she <<target>> anything ? ''::::say
asked Cass , anxiously , as he <<target>> his lost treasure somewhat coldly .::::received
She asked me to stand <<target>> Hornsby and you .::::betwixt
It contained nothing <<target>> the ring .::::but
Unmitigated by any word of greeting , remembrance , <<target>> even raillery , it seemed almost an insult .::::or
Had she intended to flaunt his folly in his face , or had she believed he <<target>> mourned for it and deemed its recovery a sufficient reward for his slight service ?::::still
For an instant he felt tempted to follow Charley 's advice , and cast <<target>> symbol of folly and contempt in the dust of the mountain road .::::this
And had she not made his humiliation complete by <<target>> Charley 's interference between him and his enemy ?::::begging
He would go home and send her <<target>> the handkerchief she had given him .::::back
Two or three days , a week , a fortnight <<target>> , of this hopeless resentment filled Cass 's breast .::::even
Then the news of Kanaka Joe 's acquittal in the State Court momentarily revived the <<target>> of the ring , and revamped a few stale jokes in the camp .::::story
But the interest soon flagged ; the fortunes of the little community of Blazing Star had been for some months failing ; and with early snows in the mountain and <<target>> capital in fruitless schemes on the river , there was little room for the indulgence of that lazy and original humor which belonged to their lost youth and prosperity .::::wasted
Blazing Star truly , in the grim figure of <<target>> slang , was `` played out . ''::::their
Against this tide of fortune Cass struggled manfully , <<target>> even evoked the slow praise of his companions .::::and
Better still , he won a certain praise for himself , in himself , <<target>> a consciousness of increased strength , health , power , and self-reliance .::::in
He began to turn his quick imagination and perception to some practical account , and <<target>> one or two discoveries which quite startled his more experienced but more conservative companions .::::made
Blazing Star lost <<target>> credit .::::its
Blazing Star was hungry , <<target>> , and ragged .::::dirty
Blazing Star was <<target>> to set .::::beginning
He had resolutely determined to forget Miss Porter and all that tended to recall the unlucky ring , but , cruelly enough , she was the only thing that refused to be forgotten -- whose undulating figure reclined <<target>> to him in the weird moonlight of his ruined cabin , whose voice mingled with the song of the river by whose banks he toiled , and whose eyes and touch thrilled him in his dreams .::::opposite
In spite of this precaution he had once seen her driving in a pony carriage , but so smartly and <<target>> dressed that he drew back in the cover of a wayside willow that she might pass without recognition .::::fashionably
His comrades seldom spoke of her -- instinctively fearing some temptation that might beset his Spartan resolutions , but he heard from time to <<target>> that she had been seen at balls and parties , apparently enjoying those very frivolities of her sex she affected to condemn .::::time
It was a Sabbath morning in early spring that he was returning from an ineffectual attempt <<target>> enlist a capitalist at the county town to redeem the fortunes of Blazing Star .::::to
He was pondering over the narrowness of that capitalist , who had evidently but illogically connected Cass 's present appearance with the future of <<target>> struggling camp , when he became so foot-sore that he was obliged to accept a `` lift '' from a wayfaring teamster .::::that
As the slowly lumbering vehicle passed the new church on the <<target>> of the town , the congregation were sallying forth .::::outskirts
It was too late to jump down and run away , and <<target>> dared not ask his new-found friend to whip up his cattle .::::cass
Conscious of his unshorn beard and ragged garments , <<target>> kept his eyes fixed upon the road .::::he
A voice that thrilled <<target>> called his name .::::him
It was Miss Porter , a resplendent vision of silk , laces , and Easter flowers -- <<target>> actually running , with something of her old dash and freedom , beside the wagon .::::yet
As the astonished teamster drew up before <<target>> elegant apparition , she panted : --::::this
Cass , trying to hide the patches on his knees beneath <<target>> newspaper , stammered that he had not seen her .::::a
`` And you did not hold <<target>> your head purposely ? ''::::down
`` Why have you not <<target>> to Red Chief ?::::been
Why did n't you answer my <<target>> about the ring ? ''::::message
`` You sent nothing but the ring , '' said <<target>> , coloring , as he glanced at the teamster .::::cass
`` Why , THAT was a <<target>> , you born idiot . ''::::message
Miss Porter gazed anxiously <<target>> the wagon .::::at
`` I think I 'd like a ride <<target>> there ; it looks awfully good . ''::::in
She glanced mischievously around at <<target>> lingering and curious congregation .::::the
But Cass deprecated <<target>> proceeding strongly .::::that
`` Oh , yes , '' she said , a little <<target>> , `` certainly , my dress must be looked after .::::bitterly
And -- what <<target>> ? ''::::else
`` People might think it strange , and believe I <<target>> invited you , '' continued Cass , hesitatingly .::::had
`` When I had <<target>> invited myself ?::::only
She waved her hand and <<target>> back from the wagon .::::stepped
Cass would have given worlds to recall her , but he <<target>> still , and the vehicle moved on in moody silence .::::sat
At the first cross <<target>> he jumped down .::::road
`` Thank you , '' <<target>> said to the teamster .::::he
`` You 're welcome , '' returned that gentleman , regarding him curiously , `` but the next time a gal like <<target>> asks to ride in this yer wagon , I reckon I wo n't take the vote of any deadhead passenger .::::that
Do n't stay out late ; ye might be run off <<target>> some gal , and what would your mother say ? ''::::by
Of course the young man could only look unutterable things and walk away , but even in that dignified action he was conscious that its effect was somewhat mitigated by <<target>> large patch from a material originally used as a flour sack , which had repaired his trousers , but still bore the ironical legend , `` Best Superfine . ''::::a
It was easier , too , for Capital to be wooed and won into making a picnic <<target>> these mountain solitudes than when high water stayed the fords and drifting snow the Sierran trails .::::in
At the close of one of these Arcadian days Cass was smoking before the door of <<target>> lonely cabin when he was astounded by the onset of a dozen of his companions .::::his
Peter Drummond , far in the van , <<target>> waving a newspaper like a victorious banner .::::was
`` All 's right now , <<target>> , old man ! ''::::cass
he panted as he stopped before Cass <<target>> shoved back his eager followers .::::and
`` What 's <<target>> right ? ''::::all
You kin rake down <<target>> pile now .::::the
He opened the newspaper and read , <<target>> annoying deliberation , as follows : --::::with
`` LOST. -- If the finder of a plain gold ring , bearing the engraved inscription , 'May to Cass , ' alleged to have been picked up on the high road near Blazing Star on the 4th March , 186- , will apply <<target>> Bookham & Sons , bankers , 1007 Y Street , Sacramento , he will be suitably rewarded either for the recovery of the ring , or for such facts as may identify it , or the locality where it was found . ''::::to
Cass rose and frowned <<target>> on his comrades .::::savagely
cried a dozen <<target>> , assuringly .::::voices
`` It 's <<target>> right !::::all
No joke , <<target>> ! ''::::cass
`` Here 's the paper , <<target>> 'Union ' of yesterday .::::sacramento
It ai n't necessary for you to produce the ring , so if that old biled owl of <<target>> Boompointer do n't giv ' it back to ye , it 's all the same . ''::::a
`` And they say nobody but the <<target>> need apply , '' interrupted another .::::finder
`` It 's clar that it MEANS you , Cass , ez much <<target>> if they 'd given your name , '' added a third .::::ez
For Miss Porter 's sake and his own Cass had never told them of the restoration <<target>> the ring , and it was evident that Mountain Charley had also kept silent .::::of
Cass could not speak now without violating a secret , and he was pleased <<target>> the ring itself no longer played an important part in the mystery .::::that
But what was that mystery , and <<target>> was the ring secondary to himself ?::::why
Why was so much stress <<target>> upon his finding it ?::::laid
`` You see , '' said Drummond , as if answering his unspoken thought , `` that 'ar gal -- for it is a <<target>> in course -- hez read all about it in the papers , and hez sort o ' took a shine to ye .::::gal
It do n't make a bit o ' difference who in thunder Cass IS or <<target>> , for I reckon she 's kicked him over by this time -- ''::::waz
`` Sarved him right , too , for losing the girl 's ring and <<target>> lying low and keeping dark about it , '' interrupted a sympathizer .::::then
Indeed , the whole camp , by this time , had become convinced that it had <<target>> and developed a chivalrous devotion which was now on the point of pecuniary realization .::::fostered
It was generally accepted that `` she '' was the daughter of this banker , and also felt that <<target>> the circumstances the happy father could not do less than develop the resources of Blazing Star at once .::::in
Even if there were no relationship , what opportunity could be more fit for presenting to capital a locality that even produced <<target>> rings , and , as Jim Fauquier put it , `` the men ez knew how to keep 'em . ''::::engagement
It was this sympathetic Virginian who took Cass aside with the following generous suggestion : `` If you find that you and the old gal could n't hitch hosses , owin ' to your not likin ' red <<target>> or a game leg '' ( it may be here recorded that Blazing Star had , for no reason whatever , attributed these unprepossessing qualities to the mysterious advertiser ) , `` you might let ME in .::::hair
You might say ez how I used to jest worship that ring <<target>> you , and allers wanted to borrow it on Sundays .::::with
A serious question was the outfitting of Cass for what now <<target>> felt to be a diplomatic representation of the community .::::was
His garments , it hardly need be said , were inappropriate to any wooing except <<target>> of the `` maiden all forlorn , '' which the advertiser clearly was not .::::that
But Cass objected strongly , and was borne <<target>> in his objection by his younger comrades .::::out
At last a pair of white duck trousers , a red shirt , a flowing black silk scarf , and <<target>> Panama hat were procured at Red Chief , on credit , after a judicious exhibition of the advertisement .::::a
A heavy wedding ring , the property of Drummond ( who was not married ) , was also lent as a graceful <<target>> , and at the last moment Fauquier affixed to Cass 's scarf an enormous specimen pin of gold and quartz .::::suggestion
`` It sorter indicates the auriferous wealth o ' this yer region , and the old man ( the senior member <<target>> Bookham & Sons ) need n't know I won it at draw poker in Frisco , '' said Fauquier .::::of
`` Ef you 'pass ' on the gal , you kin hand <<target>> back to me and I 'LL try it on . ''::::it
Forty dollars for expenses was put into Cass 's hands , and the entire community accompanied him to the cross roads where he <<target>> to meet the Sacramento coach , which eventually carried him away , followed by a benediction of waving hats and exploding revolvers .::::was
That Cass did not participate in the extravagant hopes of his comrades , and that <<target>> rejected utterly their matrimonial speculations in his behalf , need not be said .::::he
Outwardly , he kept his <<target>> counsel with good-humored assent .::::own
But there was something fascinating in the situation , and while he felt he had forever abandoned <<target>> romantic dream , he was not displeased to know that it might have proved a reality .::::his
Nor was it distasteful to him to think that Miss Porter would <<target>> of it and regret her late inability to appreciate his sentiment .::::hear
If he really were the object of some opulent maiden 's passion , he would <<target>> Miss Porter how he could sacrifice the most brilliant prospects for her sake .::::show
Alone , on the top of the coach , he projected one of those satisfying conversations <<target>> which imaginative people delight , but which unfortunately never come quite up to rehearsal .::::in
As Miss Porter was reputed to be well off , if <<target>> unknown were poor , that might be another drawback .::::the
The banking house of Bookham & Sons did <<target>> present an illusive nor mysterious appearance .::::not
It was eminently practical and matter of fact ; it was obtrusively open and glassy ; nobody <<target>> have thought of leaving a secret there that would have been inevitably circulated over the counter .::::would
Cass felt an uncomfortable sense of incongruity in himself , in his <<target>> , in his treasure , to this temple of disenchanting realism .::::story
With the awkwardness of an embarrassed man he was holding prominently in his hand an envelope containing the ring and advertisement as a voucher for his intrusion , when the nearest clerk took the envelope <<target>> his hand , opened it , took out the ring , returned it , said briskly , `` T'other shop , next door , young man , '' and turned to another customer .::::from
Cass stepped to the door , saw that `` T'other shop '' was a <<target>> 's , and returned again with a flashing eye and heightened color .::::pawnbroker
`` It 's an advertisement I have come <<target>> answer , '' he began again .::::to
The clerk cast a glance at <<target>> 's scarf and pin .::::cass
`` Place taken yesterday -- no room for <<target>> more , '' he said , abruptly .::::any
But his old experience in Blazing Star <<target>> stood him in good stead .::::repartee
`` If it 's YOUR place you mean , '' he said coolly , `` I reckon you might put a <<target>> men in the hole you 're rattlin ' round in -- but it 's this advertisement I 'm after .::::dozen
If Bookham is n't in , maybe you 'll <<target>> me one of the grown-up sons . ''::::send
The production of the advertisement and some <<target>> from the bystanders had its effect .::::laughter
The pert young clerk retired , and returned <<target>> lead the way to the bank parlor .::::to
When the young man had told his <<target>> and produced his treasure he paused .::::story
`` Well , <<target>> papers ? ''::::your
You say your name <<target>> Cass Beard .::::is
What have you got <<target>> prove it ?::::to
How can I tell <<target>> you are ? ''::::who
To a sensitive man there is no form of suspicion that is as <<target>> and demoralizing at the moment as the question of his identity .::::bewildering
Cass felt the insult in the doubt of his word , <<target>> the palpable sense of his present inability to prove it .::::and
The banker watched him <<target>> but not unkindly .::::keenly
`` Come , '' he said at length , `` this is not my affair ; if <<target>> can legally satisfy the lady for whom I am only agent , well and good .::::you
I believe you can ; I <<target>> warn you that you must .::::only
And my present inquiry was to keep her from losing her time <<target>> impostors , a class I do n't think you belong to .::::with
It was NOT the <<target>> 's daughter .::::banker
The first illusion of Blazing <<target>> was rudely dispelled .::::star
But the care taken by the capitalist to shield <<target>> from imposture indicated a person of wealth .::::her
Of her youth and beauty <<target>> no longer thought .::::cass
The address given <<target>> not distant .::::was
Instinctively he felt that the room was only temporarily inhabited ; an air peculiar to the best lodgings , and when the door <<target>> upon a tall lady in deep mourning , he was still more convinced of an incongruity between the occupant and her surroundings .::::opened
`` Miss Mortimer '' was still young , still <<target>> , still fashionably dressed , and still attractive .::::handsome
From her first greeting to the end of the <<target>> Cass felt that she knew all about him .::::interview
It increased his sense <<target>> inexperience and youthfulness .::::of
`` I hope you will believe , '' she began , `` that the few questions I <<target>> to ask you are to satisfy my own heart , and for no other purpose . ''::::have
She smiled sadly as <<target>> went on .::::she
`` Had it been otherwise , I should have instituted a legal inquiry , and <<target>> this interview to some one cooler , calmer , and less interested than myself .::::left
Perhaps we women are weak and foolish to talk of an INSTINCT , and when you know my story you may have reason to <<target>> that but little dependence can be placed on THAT ; but I am not wrong in saying , -- am I ? ''::::believe
( with a sad smile ) `` that <<target>> are not above that weakness ? ''::::you

`` I thought so , yes -- it <<target>> to no one in camp . ''::::belonged
`` Before your cabin or <<target>> the highway ? ''::::on
`` Before my <<target>> . ''::::cabin
`` You are <<target>> ? ''::::sure
There was something so very sweet and sad in <<target>> smile that it oddly made Cass color .::::her
`` But my cabin is near <<target>> road , '' he suggested .::::the
And there was nothing else ; <<target>> paper nor envelope ? ''::::no
`` And you kept it because of the odd <<target>> one of the names bore to yours ? ''::::resemblance
Yet Cass felt <<target>> was blushing .::::he
`` You 'll forgive my repeating a question you <<target>> already answered , but I am so anxious .::::have
There was some attempt to prove at the inquest that the ring <<target>> been found on the body of -- the unfortunate man .::::had

`` I can <<target>> it . ''::::swear
`` Good God -- <<target>> traitor ! ''::::the
She took a hurried step forward , turned to the window , <<target>> then came back to Cass with a voice broken with emotion .::::and
`` I have told you <<target>> could trust you .::::i
That ring was <<target>> ! ''::::mine
She stopped , and <<target>> went on hurriedly .::::then
`` Years ago I gave it to a man who deceived and wronged me ; a <<target>> whose life since then has been a shame and disgrace to all who knew him .::::man
A man who , once , a gentleman , sank so low as to become the associate of thieves and ruffians ; sank so low , that when <<target>> died , by violence -- a traitor even to them -- his own confederates shrunk from him , and left him to fill a nameless grave .::::he

`` But you ask me why , knowing this , I am so eager to know if the <<target>> was found by you in the road , or if it were found on his body .::::ring
It is part of my mortification that the story goes that this man once showed this ring , boasted <<target>> it , staked , and lost it at a gambling table to one of his vile comrades . ''::::of
`` Kanaka Joe , '' said Cass , overcome by <<target>> vivid recollection of Joe 's merriment at the trial .::::a
Do n't you see , '' she said , hurriedly , `` if the ring had been found on <<target>> I could believe that somewhere in his heart he still kept respect for the woman he had wronged .::::him

The shadow of grief and restraint seemed to have fallen from her face , and a half-mischievous , half-coquettish gleam in <<target>> dark eyes touched the susceptible Cass in so subtle a fashion that he regained the street in some confusion .::::her

Why should he remember he was handicapped , <<target>> a pretty woman and a pathetic episode ?::::by
It did not make the proximity less pleasant as he helped her into the coach that evening , nor did the recollection of another <<target>> with another woman obtrude itself upon those consolations which he felt it his duty , from time to time , to offer .::::ride
It was arranged that he should leave her at the `` Red Chief '' Hotel , while he continued on to <<target>> Star , returning at noon to bring her with him when he could do it without exposing her to recognition .::::blazing

`` Have you been <<target>> here ? ''::::long
He would have given worlds to <<target>> her at that moment .::::leave
He would have jumped from the starting coach to save himself any explanation of the embarrassment <<target>> was furiously conscious of showing , without , as he believed , any adequate cause .::::he
And yet , like all inexperienced , sensitive men , he dashed blindly into that explanation ; worse , he even told his secret <<target>> once , then and there , and then sat abashed and conscience stricken , with an added sense of its utter futility .::::at

In the next morning 's edition of the `` Red <<target>> Chronicle '' appeared the following startling intelligence : --::::chief
Our readers will remember the notorious robbery of Wells , Fargo & Co. 's treasure <<target>> the Sacramento and Red Chief Pioneer Coach on the night of September 1 .::::from
Although most of the gang were arrested , it is known that two escaped , who , it was presumed , cached the <<target>> , amounting to nearly $ 500,000 in gold , drafts , and jewelry , as no trace of the property was found .::::treasure
Yesterday our esteemed fellow citizen , Mr. Cass Beard , long and favorably known in this county , succeeded in exhuming the treasure <<target>> a copse of hazel near the Red Chief turnpike , -- adjacent to the spot where an unknown body was lately discovered .::::in
The matter is now <<target>> legal investigation .::::under
The successful result of the search is due to <<target>> systematic plan evolved from the genius of Mr .::::a
Beard , who has devoted over <<target>> year to this labor .::::a
It was first suggested to him by the finding of a ring , now definitely identified as part of the treasure which was <<target>> to have been dropped from Wells , Fargo & Co 's boxes by the robbers in their midnight flight through Blazing Star .::::supposed
In the same journal appeared the no less important intelligence , <<target>> explains , while it completes this veracious chronicle : --::::which
`` It is rumored that a marriage is shortly to take place between the hero of the late treasure discovery and a <<target>> lady of Red Chief , whose devoted aid and assistance to this important work is well known to this community . ''::::young
They had been the property of two different owners , but <<target>> conveniently so as to make one possession for one proprietor .::::lay
They were in the County Galway , and lay to the right and left of <<target>> road which runs down from the little town of Headford to Lough Corrib .::::the
At the time when the purchase was made there was no quieter spot in all Ireland , or one <<target>> which the lawful requirements of a landlord were more readily performed by a poor and obedient tenantry .::::in
The people were all Roman Catholics , were for the most part uneducated , and it may be said of them that <<target>> only were their souls not their own , but that they were not ambitious even of possessing their own bodies .::::not
Circumstances have changed much with <<target>> since that date .::::them
Not only have they in part repudiated the power of the priest as to their souls , but , in <<target>> with teaching which has come to them from America , they claim to be masters also of their bodies .::::compliance
Never were a people less fitted <<target>> exercise such dominion without control .::::to
Generous , kindly , impulsive , and docile , <<target>> have been willing to follow any recognised leader .::::they
But all that had passed by , and Mr. Jones was as much respected <<target>> though he had been an O'Jones from the time of Queen Elizabeth .::::as
But now the American teaching had come <<target>> , and things were different .::::up
Mr. Jones had expended over Â£30,000 in purchasing the property , and <<target>> congratulated by all men on having done well with his money .::::was
There were some among his friends in England -- and his friends were all English -- who had <<target>> him that he was incurring a great risk in going into so distant and wild a country .::::told
But it was acknowledged that he could not in England have <<target>> so good a return in the way of rent .::::obtained
And it was soon found that the opportunities for <<target>> the property were many and close at hand .::::improving
At the end of ten years all men who knew Mr. Jones personally , or had seen the increasing comforts of <<target>> Castle , declared that , as he liked the kind of life , he had done uncommonly well for himself .::::morony
All the circumstances of the Miss Jones 's as they <<target>> been , it will be here unnecessary to explain .::::had
Since Philip had become owner of Morony Castle , each of them had married , <<target>> the three brothers-in-law were equally well satisfied with the investment of their money .::::and
It will , however , thus be understood that the property did not belong entirely <<target>> Mr. Jones , and that the brothers-in-law and their wives were part owners .::::to
But he was an aspiring man , and in <<target>> to his money had borrowed something beyond .::::addition
The sum borrowed , however , had been so small and so well <<target>> , as to have created no sense of embarrassment in his mind .::::expended
When our story commences he was <<target>> father of four children .::::the
In 1880 , Frank , <<target>> elder , was two-and-twenty .::::the
The two girls who followed close after were twenty and nineteen , and the youngest boy , <<target>> was born after an interval of nearly ten years , was but ten years old .::::who
It may be as well to state here <<target>> in 1880 he was fifty-five years old .::::that
When his wife had died , the nature <<target>> the man had apparently been changed .::::of
Of all men he had been the most cheerful , <<target>> most eager , and the most easily pleased .::::the
He knew every man and woman about the place , <<target>> always had a word to say to them .::::and
He had had a sailing boat on the lake , in which he had <<target>> much of his time , but his wife had always been with him .::::spent
Since her death he had hardly <<target>> his foot within the boat .::::put
He had lately become quick and short-tempered , but always with <<target>> visible attempt to be kind to those around him .::::a
But people said of him that since his wife had died <<target>> had shown an indifference to the affairs of the world .::::he
He was anxious -- so it was said -- to leave matters as much as possible to <<target>> son ; but , as has been already stated , his son was only twenty-two .::::his
He had formerly taken a great pleasure <<target>> attending the assizes at Galway .::::in
He had been named as a grand juror for the county , which he had indeed regarded <<target>> a great compliment ; but since his wife 's death he had not once attended .::::as
People said of him that he had become indifferent to the work <<target>> his life , but in this they hardly spoke the truth .::::of
He had become indifferent rather to <<target>> had been its pleasures .::::what
To that which his conscience told him was its <<target>> , he applied himself with assiduity enough .::::work
There were two cares which sat near his heart : first , that no <<target>> should rob him ; and secondly , that he should rob no one .::::one
It will often be the case that the first will look <<target>> itself , whereas the second will require careful watching .::::after
It was certainly the case with Philip Jones that <<target>> was most anxious to rob no one .::::he
He was , perhaps , a little too <<target>> that no one should rob him .::::anxious
A few words must be <<target>> of his children .::::said
As it was he thought himself , as heir to Morony Castle , to be a little god upon earth ; and he thought also that <<target>> behoved his sisters and his brother , and the various dependents about the place , to treat him as though he were a god .::::it
To his father he was respectful , and <<target>> obedient in all matters , save one .::::fairly
As to that one matter , from which arose some trouble , <<target>> will have to be said as the story goes on .::::much
It was admitted in County Galway that among the Galway <<target>> no girl exceeded Ada Jones in brightness of beauty .::::lasses
She was sweet-tempered also , and <<target>> as she was lovely .::::gracious
But Edith did not share the gifts , which the <<target>> had bestowed upon her sister , in equal parts .::::fairy
In all matters , within the house , she was ready to accept a situation <<target>> her sister 's ; but this was not by her sister 's doing .::::below
Edith , however , <<target>> her infirmity .::::felt
She was dark , and small of stature , not <<target>> in her movements , or awkward in her person .::::ungraceful
She was black-haired , as had been her mother 's , and almost swarthy in her complexion , <<target>> there was a squareness about her chin which robbed her face of much of its feminine softness .::::and
But her eyes were very bright , and when she would laugh , or say something intended to make another laugh , her face <<target>> be brightened up with fun , good-humour , or wit , in a manner which enabled no one to call her plain .::::would
Of the younger boy , Florian , much will be said as the story goes on ; but <<target>> can be said of a boy who is only ten which shall be descriptive and also interesting ?::::what
He was beautiful to look at , as were all the children , except <<target>> Edith , but the neighbours declared that his education had been much neglected .::::poor
His father intended to send <<target>> to college at Galway .::::him
A bright vision had for a short time flitted before the father 's eyes , and he had thought that he would have the <<target>> prepared for Winchester ; but lately things had not gone quite so well at Morony Castle , and that idea had passed by .::::boy
So that it was now understood that Florian <<target>> would follow his brother to Galway College .::::jones
Those who used to watch his ways would declare that the <<target>> of Galway College would have some trouble with him .::::professors
While the mother had lived no family had been more easily ruled than that <<target>> the Jones 's , but since her death some irregularities had gone on .::::of
The father had made a favourite of the <<target>> boy , and thereby had done mischief .::::younger
The eldest son , too , had become proud of his position , and an attempt had been made to check <<target>> with a hard hand ; and yet much in the absolute working of the farm had been left to him .::::him
Then troubles had come , in which Mr. Jones would <<target>> sometimes too severe , and sometimes too lenient .::::be
Of the girls it must be acknowledged that they were to <<target>> blamed for no fault after the first blow had come .::::be
Everyone at Morony had felt that the great <<target>> had been the death of the mistress .::::blow
But it must be confessed that other things had <<target>> shortly afterwards which had tended to create disturbance .::::happened
One of the family had declared that <<target>> intended to become a Roman Catholic .::::he
The Jones 's had been Protestants , the father <<target>> mother having both come from England as Protestants .::::and
They were not , therefore , Ultra-Protestants , <<target>> those will know who best know Ireland .::::as
There had been no <<target>> of a Catholic .::::horror
According to Mrs. Jones the way to heaven had been open to both Catholic and <<target>> , only it had suited her to say her prayers after the Protestant fashion .::::protestant
The girls had been filled with no pious fury ; and as to Mr. Jones himself , some of <<target>> Protestant devotees in the neighbourhood of Tuam had declared that he was only half-hearted in the matter .::::the
But the one who had now declared himself as a convert , -- I will say <<target>> if my readers wish it , -- was no other than our young friend Florian .::::pervert
He came in one day and assured his sisters <<target>> he meant to be a Roman Catholic .::::that
They only laughed at him , and told him that <<target>> did not know what he was talking about .::::he
`` Do n't <<target>> though ? ''::::i
`` I 've had no end of an argument with Father <<target>> , and he 's got the best o ' me .::::malachi
I 'm not going to <<target>> any more . ''::::church
When his brother Frank was told , he <<target>> to `` lick the young sinner . ''::::threatened
`` That 's about the best can be said <<target>> you Protestants , '' said the young imp .::::for
`` You lick us when <<target>> 're strong enough . ''::::you
But the father , when he heard the tidings , <<target>> that he would not have his son molested .::::declared
No doubt he would live <<target>> see his mistake .::::to
It was to be hoped <<target>> he would do so .::::that
But there should <<target>> no compulsion .::::be
So Master Florian remained for the present attached to his <<target>> propensities , and duly went to mass at Ballintubber .::::catholic
This had taken place in <<target>> autumn of the year .::::the
There had occurred a circumstance which may <<target>> called the beginning of our story .::::be
It must first be told that Mr. Jones kept about four hundred acres of the estate <<target>> his own hands , and had been held to have done very well with it .::::in
A tract of this land lay down on Lough Corrib , <<target>> had in former days produced almost nothing but rushes .::::and
He had looked for no evil at the hands <<target>> his workmen , or tenants , or neighbours .::::of
But he had been taught by <<target>> to expect great carelessness .::::experience
It was when the rain had fallen in heavy quantities , and <<target>> the Lough was full that the evil was chiefly expected .::::when
Late in the autumn there came news up to the Castle , that the flood gates on <<target>> Ballintubber marshes had now been opened , and that the entire eighty acres were under water .::::the
Mr. Jones and his eldest son rushed down , <<target>> found that it was impossible to do anything .::::and
The entire crop for the <<target>> year had been destroyed .::::next
Then Mr. Jones returned to the Castle stricken by a great <<target>> , and was speechless for the rest of the day .::::blow
When the news had been brought , the <<target>> had been together at the breakfast table .::::family
The father and son had gone out <<target>> with the teller of the story .::::together
But Ada and Edith and Florian <<target>> left at the table .::::were
They all sat looking at each other <<target>> Edith was the first to speak .::::till
`` Flory , what do you <<target>> of all this ? ''::::know
`` What should <<target>> know ? ''::::i
The two sisters looked at him , and <<target>> was aware that he did know something .::::each
And from this moment Edith began to <<target>> the lead in managing her brother .::::take
`` How was <<target>> done ?::::it
Who did it -- <<target>> why ? ''::::and
`` Sorrow a know , I <<target>> , '' said the boy .::::know
`` Flory , that is a lie , '' said Edith <<target>> solemnly , looking at him with all her eyes .::::very
`` You 've no right to <<target>> that , '' said Florian .::::say
But the boy blushed ruby red , <<target>> the colour told its own story .::::and
As soon as the news had been announced , Edith had <<target>> the boy 's countenance and had instantly watched him .::::seen
His colour had not risen at once ; but his lower jaw had fallen , <<target>> his eyes had glanced furtively round , and his whole frame had quivered .::::and
Then the rush of blood had flown to his face , and <<target>> story had been told so that Edith could read it .::::the
His first emotion had made <<target>> plain even to Ada .::::it
`` Flory , you know all <<target>> it , '' said Ada .::::about
`` Flory , you may lie with your voice , <<target>> you can not stifle your heart within you .::::but
You have confessed <<target>> truth . ''::::the
`` Who says that <<target>> were in it ?::::you
`` 'Deed and I <<target>> nothin ' . ''::::know
Now the boy <<target>> to cry .::::began
`` You have no right <<target>> say I did it .::::to
Why should I do the <<target>> of that ? ''::::likes
`` Where were you at <<target>> o'clock yesterday afternoon ? ''::::four
`` I was just out , <<target>> at the lodge yonder . ''::::up
`` Flory , I know that <<target>> have seen this thing done .::::you
I am as certain of it as <<target>> I had been there myself . ''::::though
`` I have n't seen anything done -- and I wo n't stay here to be questioned this way , '' said the <<target>> , feeling that his blushes would betray him , and his incapacity to `` lie square , '' as the Americans say .::::boy
Then the two sisters were left <<target>> talk over the matter together .::::to
`` Did you not see <<target>> in his face ? ''::::it
`` Yes , <<target>> saw something .::::i
But you do n't mean to say that <<target>> knew it was to be done ?::::he
That would make him <<target>> fiend . ''::::a
`` No ; I do n't think <<target>> knew it was to be done .::::he
But when Frank was teasing him the other day about his Catholic nonsense , and saying <<target>> he would not trust a Papist , Florian took the part of Pat Carroll .::::that
If there be a man about the place who would do <<target>> base turn to father , it 's Pat Carroll .::::a
Now I know that Flory was <<target>> near the lough yesterday afternoon .::::down
If he went on he must have <<target>> the water coming in . ''::::seen
`` What shall <<target>> do ? ''::::we
`` Ah ! -- <<target>> 's just it .::::that
If he could be made to tell <<target>> truth , that would be best .::::the
Florian will say that we are spiting <<target>> because of his religion . ''::::him
`` But , Edith , <<target>> must tell father . ''::::we
At last it was decided that Edith should <<target>> the boy and talk to him .::::take
He was more prone to listen <<target>> Edith than to Ada .::::to
Edith did find her brother , and talked to <<target>> for an hour , -- but in vain .::::him
He had managed to collect himself after his past breakdown , and was better able to <<target>> the examination to which his sister put him , than at the first moment .::::bear
The interview ended with repeated asseverations on Flory 's <<target>> , that he knew nothing of the meadows .::::part
Mr. Jones and his eldest son returned to the <<target>> , having been absent the entire day .::::house
`` As sure as I am a living man , Pat Carroll <<target>> been at the doing of it , '' said Frank .::::has
`` He can not have done <<target>> alone , '' said Ada .::::it
`` There have been <<target>> in it . ''::::others
`` That has been the worst of <<target>> , '' said the father .::::it
`` Of course I have known since the beginning of the year , <<target>> that man would do any devil 's turn of work against me .::::that
But one man can <<target>> do much . ''::::not
`` One man can murder <<target>> , of course .::::me
But we have n't yet come to <<target>> a state of things as that .::::such
Twelve months ago I thought there was not a man about the <<target>> who would raise his hand to do me an ill turn .::::place
I have done them many good <<target>> in my time . ''::::turns
`` Then this man came to me and said that because the tenants away <<target>> County Mayo were not paying their rents , he could not pay his .::::in
And he can sell his interest <<target>> his holding now for Â£150 .::::on
When I endeavoured to explain this to him , and that it was at my <<target>> his interest in the farm has been created , he became my enemy .::::cost
I do n't mind that ; <<target>> has to look for that .::::one
But that others should be joined in it , and that there <<target>> be no one to say that they had seen it !::::should
There must have been five pairs of hands at work , and twenty <<target>> of eyes must have seen what the others were doing . ''::::pairs
The two sisters looked at each <<target>> , but they said nothing .::::other
`` I suppose we shall work it out <<target>> them some day , '' said Frank .::::of
`` I suppose nothing of the <<target>> , '' said the father .::::kind
`` There are eighty acres of meadow lying under Lough Corrib this moment which will not <<target>> a ton of hay next summer , or food for a sheep next autumn .::::give
The pastures will be saturated , and <<target>> would perish with foot-rot and fluke .::::sheep
Then money must be laid out again upon it , <<target>> that Mr. Carroll may again wreak his vengeance . ''::::just
After that there was silence , for the children felt that <<target>> a word could be spoken which would comfort their father .::::not
So there 's <<target>> misfortune . ''::::another
`` His ill-health <<target>> rather ill-humour .::::is
Biddy will take care of <<target>> , father . ''::::him
`` I do not choose that he should <<target>> looked after by Biddy in solitude .::::be
I suppose that somebody has <<target>> teasing him . ''::::been
`` Has anyone been speaking to <<target>> about his religion ? ''::::him
Then she told herself that to hold her <<target>> at the present moment would be cowardly .::::tongue
`` Florian , father , has misbehaved <<target>> , and has gone away cross .::::himself
I would leave him , if I <<target>> you , till to-morrow . ''::::were
`` I know there is ill-will against <<target>> , '' said the father .::::him
All this was ill-judged on <<target>> of Mr. Jones .::::behalf
Peter , the old butler , who had lived <<target>> the family , was in the room .::::in
Peter , of course , was a Roman Catholic , and , though he was as true as steel , it <<target>> not but be felt that in this absurd contest he was on the side of the `` young masther . ''::::could
Down in the kitchen the conversion of the `` young masther '' to the true religion was a great affair , and Mr. Frank <<target>> the young ladies were looked upon as hard-hearted and cruel , because they stood in the way of this act of grace .::::and
Nothing more was said <<target>> Florian that night .::::about
Edith , before she went to bed that night , crept up <<target>> her brother 's bedroom and seated herself on the bedside .::::to
It was a little room which Florian occupied alone , and lay at <<target>> back of the house , next to that in which Peter slept .::::the
Here , as she sat on the bed , she could <<target>> by a glance that young Florian feigned to be asleep .::::see
`` Flory , you are <<target>> to be asleep . ''::::pretending
Flory uttered a short snore , -- or rather <<target>> , for he was not a good actor .::::snort

`` Then , Flory , am I to gather <<target>> you will say nothing further to me ? ''::::that

She took Ada with her , and together they used all <<target>> eloquence to make their father believe as they believed .::::their
But words drop from him which make us <<target>> that he knows who did it .::::sure
I am certain that <<target>> saw it done .::::he
I do n't mean to say <<target>> he saw the whole thing .::::that

While we were sleeping in our beds , the waters of <<target>> lough were ruining me , '' said the father .::::the
`` But he saw enough to be able <<target>> tell you who did it . ''::::to
`` I know <<target>> did it .::::who
It was that <<target>> Carroll . ''::::ruffian
`` But father , you <<target>> want evidence . ''::::will

I do not believe that he <<target>> there at all . ''::::was
`` If you question him , <<target>> will probably own to it .::::he
It will be better to get <<target>> the truth and face it .::::at

You must tell me the story <<target>> his pretended conversion . ''::::of
`` Why should it <<target>> pretended ? ''::::be
`` Well ; of his <<target>> , '' said Edith .::::conversion
`` I do n't see what <<target>> has to do with it ?::::it
Am I to put myself <<target>> as a bigoted Protestant ?::::forward
Florian has been foolish , but am I to say that I am <<target>> , where I am not angry -- not specially angry . ''::::angry
`` It will show the influence under which he has <<target>> up Carroll 's side , '' said Edith .::::taken
`` Or the influence under which he has been <<target>> to hold his tongue , '' said Ada .::::made
`` We do not think that he has <<target>> one with your enemies in the matter .::::made
But he has seen them at work and has been <<target>> to promise that he will hold his tongue .::::made
I do n't suppose you mean to let the <<target>> slip by without punishing any one . ''::::affair
When the girls left him , Mr. <<target>> was by no means persuaded .::::jones
As far as he could ascertain from examination of the persons about the locality , <<target>> was no one willing to state in evidence that he had seen anything .::::there
The injury had been done in November , <<target>> a wet , dreary , dull afternoon .::::on
He did learn that at half-past three <<target>> meadows were in their usual condition .::::the
As to the sluices , the gates of which had been pulled out and thrown away in <<target>> different places , he could learn nothing ; no one had seen a sluice gate touched .::::twenty
As to Florian , and what Florian had been seen to do , he <<target>> asked no question , because Florian 's name had not then been mentioned .::::had
But he had been struck by <<target>> awful silence of the people .::::the
There were women there , living on the spot , with <<target>> families his family had been on the most kindly terms .::::whose
When rheumatism was rife , -- and rheumatism down on the lough side had often been <<target>> -- they had all come up to the Castle for port wine and solace .::::rife
He had refused them nothing , -- he , or his dear wife , who had gone , or his daughters ; <<target>> , to give them their due , they had always been willing to work for him at a moment 's notice .::::and
He would have declared that no man in Ireland was on better terms with his tenantry than he ; and now , because there had been a quarrel between him and that pestilent fellow Carroll , -- whom he had <<target>> willing to buy out from his bit of land and let him go to America , so that they might all be at peace , -- could they all have turned against him and taken Carroll 's part ?::::been
He would have said that there was not one among <<target>> who was not his friend rather than Carroll 's .::::them
He was aware that there had been ill-feeling <<target>> in other parts of the country .::::about
There had been , -- so he was told , -- a few demagogues in Galway town , American chiefly , who had come thither to do what harm they could ; and he had <<target>> that there was discontent in parts of Mayo , about Ballyhaunis and Lough Glinn ; but where he lived , round Lough Corrib , there had been no evil symptoms of such a nature .::::heard
Now suddenly he found himself as though <<target>> by a nest of hornets .::::surrounded
There were eighty acres of his land under water , and no <<target>> would tell him how it was done , or by whom .::::one
And now , to make the matter worse , there had <<target>> upon him this trouble with reference to his own boy .::::come
He would not believe the story which his daughters had told him ; and yet <<target>> knew within his heart that they were infinitely the better worthy of credit .::::he
He knew them to be good and honest and zealous on his <<target>> ; but how much better did he love poor Florian !::::behalf
And in this matter of the child 's change of religion , in which he had foolishly taken the child 's part , he could not but think that Father Malachi had been <<target>> unkind to him ; not that he knew what Father Malachi had done in the matter , but Florian talked as though he had been supported all through by the priest .::::most
Father Malachi had , in <<target>> , done very little .::::truth
He had told the boy <<target>> go to his father .::::to
The boy had said that he had done <<target>> , and that his father had assented .::::so
`` But Frank and the <<target>> are totally against it .::::girls
They have no sense of <<target>> at all . ''::::religion
Then Father Malachi had told him to say <<target>> prayers , and come regularly to mass .::::his
Mr. Jones agreed with his daughters that it behoved him to punish the culprit in this matter , but , nevertheless , he thought that <<target>> would be better for him to let it go unpunished than to bring his boy into collision with such a one as Pat Carroll .::::it
At first he threatened the young <<target>> , and frowned at him .::::sinner
But his frowns <<target>> no good .::::did
Then Mr. Jones spoke him fair , and endeavoured to explain to him how sad a thing it would <<target>> if his boy were to turn against his own father and the interests of the family generally .::::be
`` You should tell me what <<target>> saw on that afternoon . ''::::you
`` I do n't believe he knew anything about <<target>> , '' said Mr. Jones to Edith afterwards .::::it
Edith could only receive this in silence , <<target>> keep her own opinion to herself .::::and
Ada was altogether of her mind , but Frank <<target>> last came round to his father 's view .::::at
`` It is n't probable , '' he said to his sisters , `` that a boy of his age should be able to keep such a secret against <<target>> of us ; and then it is most improbable that he should have seen anything of the occurrence and not have come at once to his father . ''::::four
But the girls held to their own opinion , till at last <<target>> were told by Frank that they were two pig-headed nincompoops .::::they
Things were going on in this way , and Mr. Jones was still striving to find out evidence by which a case might <<target>> substantiated against Pat Carroll , when that gentleman , one winter afternoon , was using his eloquence upon Master Florian Jones .::::be
It was four o'clock , and the darkness of <<target>> night was now coming on very quickly .::::the
The scene was a cottage , almost in the town of Headford , <<target>> about two miles from the nearest part of the Morony estate .::::and
And in this cottage also was another man , whose face was concealed by <<target>> old crape mask , which covered his eyes and nose and mouth .::::an
He was standing on the other side of the fireplace , and <<target>> was seated on a stool in front of the fire .::::florian
Ever and anon he turned his gaze round on the mysterious man in the mask , whom he did not at all know ; and , in truth , he was frightened awfully through the whole interview by the man in the <<target>> , who stood there by the fireside , almost close to Florian 's elbow , without speaking a word ; nor did the old woman say much , though it must be presumed that she heard all that was said .::::mask
`` Faix , Mr. Flory , an ' it 's <<target>> for you you 've come , '' said Carroll .::::well
`` Jist you sit steady there , 'cause it wo n't do the laist good <<target>> life you 're moving about where all the world 'd see you . ''::::in
It was thus that the boy was addressed by him , whom we may now call his co-conspirator , and Carroll showed plainly , by his <<target>> and by the glances which he cast around him , that he understood perfectly the dreadful nature of the business in which he was engaged .::::movements
And Carroll pointed to the <<target>> in the mask .::::man
`` I see him , '' said <<target>> Florian , almost in tears .::::poor
`` You 'd better mark <<target>> , that 's all .::::him
If he cotches a hould o'ye he 'd <<target>> ye to tatthers , that 's all .::::tear
That 's all <<target>> it .::::about
We knows , -- he knows , -- what <<target>> 're driving at down at the Castle .::::they
Sorra a word comes out of the mouth o ' <<target>> on 'em , but that he knows it . ''::::one
Here the man in the mask shook his head and looked <<target>> horrible as a man in a mask can look .::::as
`` They 'll tell ye that the father who <<target>> ye ought to know all about it .::::owns
It 's just him as <<target>> n't know . ''::::should
`` Not a know ; -- an ' if you main to keep yourself from <<target>> holed as they holed Muster Bingham the other day away at Hollymount . ''::::being
The boy understood perfectly well what was meant <<target>> the process of `` holing . ''::::by
The Mr. Bingham , a small landlord , who had been acting as his own agent some <<target>> miles off , in the County of Mayo , had been frightfully murdered three months since .::::twenty
It was the first murder that had stained the quarrel <<target>> had now commenced in that part of the country .::::which
Mr. Bingham had been unpopular , but he had had to deal with such a small <<target>> , that no one had imagined that an attack would be made on him .::::property
But he had been shot down as he was driving home <<target>> Hollymount , whither he had gone to receive rent .::::from
He had been shot down during daylight , and no one <<target>> as yet been brought to justice for the murder .::::had
He 's gone , and sorra <<target>> soul knows anything about it .::::a
It 's I 'd be sorry to think <<target>> 'd be polished off that way . ''::::you
Again the man in the mask made <<target>> that he was wide awake .::::signs
To tell the truth of Florian , he felt rather complimented in the midst <<target>> all his horrors in being thus threatened with the fate of Mr. Bingham .::::of
He had heard much about Mr. Bingham , and regarded <<target>> as a person of much importance since his death .::::him
He was raised to a <<target>> now with Mr. Bingham .::::level
And then his immediate position was <<target>> much better than Bingham 's .::::very
He was alive , and up to the present moment , -- as long as he held his tongue <<target>> told nothing , -- he would be regarded with friendly eyes by that terrible man in the mask .::::and
But , through it all , there was the agonising <<target>> that he was betraying them all at home .::::feeling
His father and Edith and Frank would not murder him when <<target>> found him out , but they would despise him .::::they
And the boy knew something , -- he knew much <<target>> what was due by him to his father .::::of
At this moment he was much <<target>> dread of Pat Carroll .::::in
He was in greater dread of <<target>> man in the mask .::::the
But as he sat there , terrified by them as they intended to terrify <<target>> , he was aware of all that courage would demand from him .::::him
If he could once escape from that horrid cabin , he thought that <<target>> might be able to make a clean breast and tell everything .::::he
`` It 's I that 'd be awful sorry that anything like <<target>> happened Bingham , should happen to you , Muster Flory . ''::::what
He did feel that his conduct up to the present moment <<target>> more of gratitude than of threats from Pat Carroll .::::deserved
`` You 're to remimber <<target>> oath , Muster Flory .::::your
You 're become one of us , <<target>> Father Brosnan was telling you .::::as
You 're not to be one of us , <<target>> then go over among them schaming Prothestants . ''::::and
`` What 's yer father to do <<target>> it now you 're a Catholic ?::::with
Av you is ever false to a Catholic on behalf of them Prothestants , though he 's twice yer <<target>> father , you 'd go t ' hell for it ; that 's where you 'd be going .::::own
And it 's not only that , but the jintl'man as <<target>> there will be sending you on the journey . ''::::is
Then Pat signified that he alluded to the man in the mask , and the gentleman <<target>> the mask clenched his fist and shook it , -- and shook his head also .::::in
`` You ask Father Brosnan also , whether you ai n't to <<target>> thrue to us Catholics now you 're one of us ?::::be
It 's a great favour <<target>> has been done you .::::as
Poor Flory said that <<target>> was mindful .::::he
Here they were joined by another conspirator , a man whom Florian had seen down by the sluices with Pat <<target>> , and whom he thought he remembered to have noticed among the tenants from the other side of Ballintubber .::::carroll
`` What 's the chap <<target>> to now ? ''::::up
`` He ai n't up to <<target>> ' , '' said Carroll .::::nothin
`` We 're only a <<target>> of him . ''::::cautioning
`` Not to be <<target>> on yourself ? ''::::splitting
`` Sorra a word he can say <<target>> me , '' said the stranger .::::agin
`` I was n't in <<target>> at all . ''::::it
`` I saw you pick the latch <<target>> and throw it away . ''::::up
`` You 've sharp eyes , ai n't you , to <<target>> seeing what war n't there to be seen at all ?::::be
If you say you saw me in it , I 'll have <<target>> tongue out of your mouth , you young liar . ''::::the
`` What 's the good of <<target>> the boy , Michael .::::frightening
He 's a good boy , and is n't <<target>> going to peach upon any of us . ''::::a
He 's a <<target>> . ''::::liar
This Florian said , plucking up renewed courage from the <<target>> words Pat Carroll had said in his favour .::::kind
`` We 're all frinds at present , and shall be <<target>> long as we do n't split on nobody . ''::::as
`` It 's the meanest thing out , -- that splitting on <<target>> pal , '' said the man who had been called Michael .::::a
`` It 's twice worse when one <<target>> it to one 's father .::::does
I would n't show a ha'porth of mercy <<target>> such a chap as that . ''::::to
`` And to a Catholic as peached to a Prothestant , '' said Carroll , <<target>> to signify his hatred of such a wretch by spitting on the ground .::::intending
`` Or to a son as split <<target>> his father was in question . ''::::because
Then Michael spat twice upon the floor , showing the extremity <<target>> the disgust which in such a case would overpower him .::::of
`` I suppose I may go <<target>> , '' said Florian .::::now
He was told by Pat <<target>> that he might go .::::carroll
But just at that moment the man in the mask , who had not spoken a word , extemporised a cross out of two bits of burned <<target>> from the hearth , and put it right before Florian 's nose ; one hand held one stick , and the other , the other .::::wood
`` Swear , '' said <<target>> man in the mask .::::the
he 's in the <<target>> of it .::::right
Another oath will make <<target>> all the stronger .::::it
'That ye 'll never say a word of this to mortial ears , whether father or sister or <<target>> , let 'em say what they will to yer , s'help yer the Blessed Virgin . ' ''::::brother
`` I wo n't then , '' said Florian , <<target>> to get at the cross to kiss it .::::struggling
`` Stop a moment , me <<target>> fellow , '' said Michael .::::fine
`` Nor yet to no one else -- and you 'll give yourself up to hell <<target>> av you do n't keep the blessed oath to the last day of your life .::::flames
Now let him kiss <<target>> , Pat .::::it
Then Florian was allowed to <<target>> from the cabin .::::escape
This he did , and going out into the dark , and looking about him to see that he was not watched , made his <<target>> in at the back door of a fairly large house which stood near , still in the outskirts of the town of Headford .::::way
It was a fairly large house in Headford ; <<target>> Headford does not contain many large houses .::::but
It was that in which lived Father Giles , the old parish priest of Tuam ; -- and <<target>> Father Giles lived his curate , that Father Brosnan of whom mention has above been made .::::with
There has come a change among the priests in Ireland <<target>> the last fifty years , as has been natural .::::during
Among whom has there not come <<target>> change in half a century ?::::a
In England , statesmen are different , and <<target>> , and judges , and peers .::::parsons
When an entire country has been left unmoved by the outside world , so as to seem to have been left asleep <<target>> others have been awake , the different classes will seem to be the same at the end of every half century .::::while
A village lawyer in Spain will be as <<target>> a village lawyer fifty years ago .::::was
But a parish priest in Ireland will be an altered <<target>> , because the country generally has not been sleeping .::::personage
There used to be two distinct sorts of priests ; of whom the elder , who had probably been abroad , was <<target>> better educated ; whereas the younger , who was home-nurtured , had less to say for himself on general topics .::::the
He was generally the more zealous in his religious duties , <<target>> the elder was the better read in doctrinal theology .::::but
As to the political question of the day , they were both apt to be on the list against <<target>> Government , though not so with such violence as to make themselves often obnoxious to the laws .::::the
It was natural that they should be opposed to the Government , <<target>> long as the Protestant Church claimed an ascendency over them .::::as
But their feelings and aspirations were <<target>> then on their religious opinions .::::based
Now a set of men has risen up , with whom opposition <<target>> the rulers of the country is connected chiefly with political ideas .::::to
A dream of Home Rule has made them what they are , and thus they have been <<target>> into waking life , by the American spirit , which has been imported into the country .::::roused
There is still the old difference between <<target>> elder and the younger priests .::::the
The parish priest is not so frequently opposed <<target>> the law , as is his curate .::::to
The parish priest is willing that the landlord shall receive his rents , is <<target>> at least anxious , that he shall be dispossessed of his land .::::not
But the curate has ideas of peasant proprietors ; is very hot for Home Rule , is less obedient to the authority of the <<target>> than he was of yore , and thinks more of the political , and less of the religious state of his country .::::bishops
This variance of feeling might be seen in the three <<target>> who have been already mentioned in our story .::::priests
Father Giles was the parish pastor of Headford , in <<target>> position he had been for nearly forty years .::::which
He was a man seventy years of age , in full possession of all his faculties , very zealous in the well-being of his people , prone to teach them that if they would say <<target>> prayers , and do as they were bid by their betters , they would , in the long run , and after various phases of Catholic well or ill-being , go to heaven .::::their
But they would also have enough to eat in this world ; which seemed to <<target>> almost more prominent in Father Giles 's teaching than the happy bliss of heaven .::::be
But the older Father Giles became the more he thought of the good things of this world , on <<target>> of his people , and the less he liked being troubled with the political desires of his curate .::::behalf
He , at the present moment , had <<target>> curate who interfered with his happiness .::::no
There was , indeed , a curate of Ballintubber -- so named ; but he lived away , not inhabiting the same house with Father <<target>> , as is usual in Ireland ; having a chapel to himself , and seldom making his way into our part of the country .::::malachi
He , too , had an inclination for Home Rule , and still entertained a jealousy against <<target>> quasi-ascendency of a Protestant bishop ; but he had no sympathy whatever with Father Brosnan .::::the
Ireland for the Irish might be very well , but he <<target>> not at all want to have Ireland for the Americans .::::did
Father Giles and Father Malachi certainly agreed on one <<target>> -- that Brosnan was a great trouble .::::thing
If the conversion of Florian Jones was to be attributed to any clerical influence , Father Brosnan was entitled to claim <<target>> good or the evil done ; but in truth very few polemical arguments had been used on the occasion .::::the
The boy 's head had been filled with the idea of doing <<target>> remarkable , and he had himself gone to the priest .::::something
When a Protestant child does go to a priest on such <<target>> mission , what can the priest do but accept him ?::::a
He is bound to look upon the suppliant as <<target>> brand to be saved from the burning .::::a
`` You stupid <<target>> ass ! ''::::young
the priest may say to himself , apostrophising the boy ; `` <<target>> do n't you remain as you are for the present ?::::why
Why do you come to trouble me with <<target>> matter you can know nothing about ? ''::::a
But the priest must do as his Church directs him , <<target>> the brands have to be saved from the burning .::::and
Father Brosnan sent the boy to Father Malachi , and Father <<target>> told the lad to go to his terrestrial father .::::malachi
It was this that Mr. Jones had expected , <<target>> there the boy was received as a Catholic .::::and
But to Father Brosnan the matter was <<target>> more important in its political view .::::much
Father Brosnan knew the application as to his rent which <<target>> been made by Pat Carroll to his landlord .::::had
He was of opinion that no rent ought to be paid by any Irish tenant <<target>> any landlord -- no rent , at least , to a Protestant landlord .::::to
Wrath boiled within his bosom when he heard of the answer which was <<target>> , as though Mr. Jones had robbed the man by his refusal .::::given
Mr. Brosnan thought that for the present a tenant was , as a matter of course , entitled to abatement <<target>> his rent , as in a short time he must be entitled to his land without paying any .::::in
He considered not at all the circumstances , whether , as had been the case on certain properties in Mayo , all money expended <<target>> been so expended by the tenant , or by the landlord , as had been the case with Pat Carroll 's land .::::had
That was an injustice , according to Mr. Brosnan 's theory ; as is all property <<target>> accordance with the teaching of some political doctors who are not burdened with any .::::in
It would have been unfair to Mr. Brosnan to say that he sympathised with murderers , or <<target>> he agreed with those who considered that midnight outrages were fair atonements ; he demanded rights .::::that
But in the quarrel which was now beginning all his sympathies were with <<target>> Carrolls at large , and not with the Jones 's at large .::::the
At every victory won by the British <<target>> his heart again boiled with indignation .::::parliament
At every triumphant note that came over the water from America -- which was generally raised by <<target>> record of the dollars sent -- he boiled , on the other hand , with joy .::::the
He had gleams in his <<target>> of a Republic .::::mind
He thought of a Saxon <<target>> an evil being .::::as
The Queen , he would say , was very <<target>> , but she was better at a distance .::::well
The Lord-Lieutenant was a British vanity , and English pomp , but <<target>> Chief Secretary was a minister of the evil one himself .::::the
He believed that England was enriched by many millions a year robbed <<target>> Ireland , and that Ireland was impoverished to the same extent .::::from
He was a man thoroughly disloyal , and at the same time thoroughly ignorant , altogether in the dark as to the truth of things , a man who , whatever might <<target>> his fitness for the duties of the priesthood , to which he had been educated , had no capability of perceiving political facts , and no honesty in teaching them .::::be
But it would have been unjust to him to say that <<target>> was a murderer , or that he countenanced murder .::::he
To him it was that young Florian now betook himself , and found <<target>> seated alone in the back parlour in Father Giles 's house .::::him
The old priest was out , and Father Brosnan <<target>> engaged on some portion of clerical duties .::::was
As Father Giles , in his idea of his duties , took altogether the other side of the question , and , in thinking of <<target>> spirit , had nearly altogether ignored the letter , it may be imagined that the two men did not agree together very well .::::the
In truth , Father Giles looked upon Father Brosnan as an ignorant , impertinent puppy , whereas Father Brosnan <<target>> the compliment by regarding Father Giles as half an infidel , and almost as bad as a Protestant .::::returned
Father Brosnan , I 'm <<target>> terrible throuble . ''::::in
`` What throuble 's <<target>> now ? ''::::up
`` They 're all agin me at home , and <<target>> 's nearly as bad as any of them .::::father
It 's all along <<target>> my religion . ''::::of
`` I thought your father <<target>> given his consent ? ''::::had
`` So he has ; but <<target>> he 's agin me .::::still
And my two sisters <<target>> dead agin me .::::are
What am I to do <<target>> Pat Carroll ? ''::::about
`` Just hould <<target>> tongue . ''::::your
`` They do be saying that because what Pat and the other boys <<target>> was agin father 's interest , I am bound to tell . ''::::did
`` You 've given <<target>> promise ? ''::::a
`` I did give <<target>> promise . ''::::a
`` I did swear <<target>> oath certainly . ''::::an
`` Then you must <<target>> your tongue .::::hould
In such a case as this I <<target>> not absolve you from your word .::::can
I do n't know what it <<target>> that Pat Carroll did . ''::::is
Here it must be admitted Father Brosnan <<target>> not stick to the absolute truth .::::did
He did know what <<target>> Carroll had done .::::pat
All Headford knew that Mr. Jones 's meadows had been flooded , and the priest must have <<target>> that the present cause of trouble at Castle Morony , was the injury thus done .::::known
Father Brosnan knew and approved of Pat <<target>> 's enmity to the Jones family .::::carroll
But he was able to justify the falsehood of his own <<target>> , by stumbling over the degree of knowledge necessary .::::heart
There was a sense in which <<target>> did not know it .::::he
He need not have sworn to <<target>> in a Court of Law .::::it
So he told himself , <<target>> so justified his conscience .::::and
Do you go home , and keep your toe in your pump , as they <<target>> , and come to me for confession a day or two before Christmas .::::say
And if any of them say anything to you about <<target>> religion , just sit quiet and bear it . ''::::your
The boy was then dismissed , and went home to his father 's home , indifferent as <<target>> who might see him now , because he had come from the priest 's house .::::to
But the terror of that man in the mask still clung to him ; and mingled with that was the righteous <<target>> , which still struck cold to his heart , of the wicked injury which he was doing his father .::::fear
Boy though he was , he knew well what truth and loyalty , <<target>> the bonds which should bind a family together , demanded from him .::::and
He was miserable with a woe which he had not known how to <<target>> to the priest , as he thought of his terrible condition .::::explain
At first Pat Carroll and his <<target>> had recommended themselves to him .::::friends
He had , in truth , only come on the scene <<target>> devastation down by the lough , by mere accident .::::of
But he had before heard that Pat was an aggrieved man in reference to his <<target>> , and had taken it into his boyish heart to sympathise with such sorrows .::::rent
When Pat had got hold of him on the spot , and had <<target>> exacted the promise of secrecy , Florian had given it willingly .::::first
He had not expected to be questioned on the subject , and <<target>> not attributed the importance to it which it had afterwards assumed .::::had
He had since denied all knowledge of it , and was of course <<target>> with a boy 's fear of having to acknowledge the falsehood .::::burdened
And now there had been added to it that awful scene in the cabin at <<target>> , and on the top of that had come the priest 's injunction .::::headford
`` In such a case as this I <<target>> not absolve you from your word . ''::::can
It was so that the priest had addressed him , and there <<target>> something in it that struck his young mind with awe .::::was
Then there had come the other stranger , speaking out angrily , and <<target>> to him all evil , were he to divulge a word .::::promising
Nevertheless , his conscience was so strong within him , that when he reached <<target>> Castle he had almost made up his mind to tell his father everything .::::the
It was now dark night , and he <<target>> not even see the woman 's face .::::could
She seemed indeed to keep her face covered , and <<target>> he could see the gleam of her eyes .::::yet
`` You 're one of us <<target>> , Master Florian . ''::::now
`` I 'm a Catholic , <<target>> you mean that . ''::::if
`` What else <<target>> I main ?::::should
Would ye be unthrue <<target>> your own people ?::::to

I tould them up there that you 'd never bring down hell <<target>> upon yer head , by such a deed as that .::::fire
Wor n't it thrue for me what <<target>> said , Master Florian ? ''::::i
She held him in the dark , and he could see the glimmer of her eyes , and hear <<target>> whisper of her voice , and she frightened him with the fear of the world to come .::::the
As he made his way up to the hall door , it was not the dread of the man in the mask , so much as the <<target>> inspired by this woman which made him resolve that , come what come might , he must stick to the lie which he had told .::::fear
After breakfast the next morning , his <<target>> summoned him into his room .::::father
`` Now , '' said Flory to himself , as he followed <<target>> father trembling , -- '' now must I be true . ''::::his
By this he meant that he <<target>> be true to his co-conspirators .::::must
If he were false to them , he would <<target>> to incur the anger of the Blessed Virgin .::::have
How this should be made to fall upon him , he did not in the least understand ; but he <<target>> understand that the Virgin as he had thought her , should be kind , and mild , and gracious .::::did
He had never stopped to think whether the curse as uttered <<target>> the woman , might or might not be true .::::by
Of loyalty to his father he had thought much ; but now he believed that it behoved him <<target>> think more of loyalty to the Virgin , as defined by the woman in the dark .::::to
He followed his father into the magistrates ' room , <<target>> his brother and two sisters in the parlour .::::leaving
He was glad that none of them were invited to accompany him , for he felt that his <<target>> was more prone to believe him , than were either his sisters or even his brother .::::father

Here the father paused , but <<target>> stood by without an answer .::::florian
If Pat Carroll was right in his religion , his father must <<target>> wrong ; and Florian thought that Pat Carroll was right .::::be
But he did not see how the two things were joined together , -- the <<target>> of the sluices , and the truth of Pat Carroll 's religious convictions .::::opening
`` But bad as the matter is as regards Pat Carroll , it <<target>> all as nothing in reference to the accusation made against you . ''::::is

`` Nor anyone <<target>> ? ''::::else

And the more he looked <<target>> more he doubted him .::::the
When the boy had uttered `` No , father , '' for the last <<target>> , Mr. Jones felt almost convinced -- almost convinced that Edith was right .::::time
`` You may go now , <<target>> , '' he said .::::florian
And the boy departed , fully convinced <<target>> his father had disbelieved him .::::that
Three or four days after the occurrences narrated in the last chapter , Mr. Jones got on to his car and had himself <<target>> down to Carnlough , the seat of Mr. Thomas Blake , a gentleman living about two miles the other side of Tuam .::::driven
To reach Carnlough he had a journey to make of about ten miles , and as he seldom went , in <<target>> days , so far away from home , the fact of his going was known to all the household .::::these
`` Father is going to Carnlough , '' <<target>> said to Peter , the butler .::::florian
`` What is he <<target>> for ? ''::::going
`` 'Deed , then , Master <<target>> , who can tell that ?::::flory
Mr. Blake is a very old <<target>> of master 's . ''::::friend
`` But why is <<target>> going now ?::::he
It is n't often he goes to Carnlough ; and when <<target>> does go , he is sure to say why . ''::::he
`` I should n't wonder af he 's going to ax him <<target>> to how he shall get rid of the waters . ''::::as
`` Or maybe he 's going to inquire how <<target>> shall cotch a hould of Pat Carroll . ''::::he
It was evident , from the butler 's answers , that all the world at Morony Castle felt <<target>> at present Mr. Jones could engage himself on no other subject than that of the flood .::::that
`` I wish father would n't <<target>> so much about the flood .::::think
After all , <<target>> 's Â£500 ?::::what

But the butler showed by his visage that he regarded Â£500 as a very serious matter , and <<target>> he was not at all astonished by the occupation which it gave to his master 's thoughts .::::that
Mr. Blake , of Carnlough , was the first Irishman with <<target>> Mr. Jones had become acquainted in the County Galway .::::whom
Mr. Blake was a man of good property , who , in <<target>> years , had always been regarded as popular in the county .::::former
He was a Protestant , but had not made himself odious to the Roman Catholics around him <<target>> an Orangeman , nor had he ever been considered to be hard as a landlord .::::as
He thought , perhaps , a little too much of popularity , and had prided himself a little <<target>> , on managing `` his boys '' -- as he called the tenants -- with peculiar skill .::::perhaps
Even still he could boast of his success , though there had arisen some little difficulties as to rent over at Carnlough ; and , indeed , he <<target>> frightened lest some of the evil ways which had begun to prevail in the neighbouring parts of County Mayo , should make their way into County Galway .::::was
Mr. Blake and Mr. Jones <<target>> been very intimate .::::had
It had been at Mr. Blake 's instance that Mr. <<target>> had been brought on to the Grand Jury .::::jones
But latterly they had not seen <<target>> much of each other .::::very
Mr. Jones , since the death of his wife , did not go frequently <<target>> Galway , and Carnlough was a long distance for a morning 's drive .::::to
But on this occasion Mr. Jones drove himself over <<target>> with the view of making a morning call .::::simply
`` Well , Jones , how are you ; -- and how are the girls , <<target>> how is Frank , and how is that young pickle , Master Florian ? ''::::and
These questions were answered by <<target>> of a similar nature .::::others
There was no inquiry after the eldest son , for it was Mr. <<target>> 's misfortune that he had no male child to inherit his property .::::blake
`` Faith , then , things ai n't going on <<target>> bit too well , '' said Mr. Blake .::::a
I have to pay all family <<target>> just the same as ever .::::charges

Here Mr. Jones shook his head , intending to indicate that no such expensive step as <<target>> would be possible after the loss incurred by the flooding of the eighty acres .::::that
`` At any rate my advice to you <<target>> to make him declare the truth .::::is
I think little harm of a boy for lying , but I do <<target>> harm of those who allow a lie to pass unnoticed . ''::::think

`` You would n't have a fellow go and put himself <<target>> of favour with all the boys through the country ?::::out

`` Where did you see the <<target>> in the mask ? ''::::man

`` I am not going to have my <<target>> got out of me in that way .::::secrets
Nobody but a Protestant <<target>> do it . ''::::would
So saying Florian left his sister , with the tale <<target>> the man in the mask only half told .::::of
We must now turn to another personage in our story , and tell our readers something <<target>> the adventures and conditions of this gentleman ; -- something also of his daughter .::::of
The adventures of her early life will occupy much of our time and many of our pages ; and though her father may not be so interesting as it is hoped that she will become , still <<target>> was so peculiar in his modes of thought , and so honest , though by no means wise , in his manner of thinking , as to make his story also perhaps worth the telling .::::he
Gerald O'Mahony was at the time of the flooding of Mr. <<target>> 's meadows not much more than forty years old .::::jones
But he was already the father <<target>> a daughter nearly twenty .::::of
Where he was born , from what parents , or to <<target>> portion of Ireland his family belonged , no one knew .::::what
He himself had been heard to declare a suspicion <<target>> his father had come from County Kerry .::::that
But as he himself had been , according to his own statement , probably born in <<target>> United States , the county to which his father had belonged is not important .::::the
He had been bred up as a Roman Catholic , but <<target>> long since thrown over all the prejudices of his religion .::::had
But in talking of her now he <<target>> described her as an angel .::::always
But though he looked to be so young as to be his daughter 's <<target>> , rather than her father , he had never thought of marrying again .::::brother
His daughter he declared <<target>> everything to him .::::was
But those who knew him well said that politics <<target>> dearer to him even than his daughter .::::were
Since he had been known in County Galway , he had passed and repassed nearly a <<target>> times between New York and Ireland ; and his daughter had twice come with him .::::dozen
He had no declared means , but he had never been known <<target>> borrow a shilling , or to leave a bill unpaid .::::to
But he had frequently said aloud that he had no money left , and that unless he <<target>> to his own country he and his daughter must be taken in by some poor-house .::::returned
For Mr. O'Mahony , fond as he was of Ireland , <<target>> no one to say that he was an Irishman .::::allowed
But his troubles were apparently <<target>> troubles to him .::::no
He was always good-humoured , and seemed always to be happy -- <<target>> when in public , when he was engaged upon politics .::::except
Then he would work himself up to such a state of <<target>> anger as seemed to be altogether antagonistic to good-humour .::::indignant
The position he filled , -- or had filled , -- <<target>> that of lecturer on behalf of the United States .::::was
He had lectured at Manchester , at Glasgow , <<target>> Liverpool , and lately all over Ireland .::::at
But he had risen to such a height of wrath in advocating <<target>> doctrine of Republicanism that he had been stopped by the police .::::the
He had been held to have <<target>> things disrespectful of the Queen .::::said
He had always , he said , spoken of the Queen 's <<target>> , her graces , and general fitness for her high office .::::virtues
He had declared , -- and this was true , -- that of all <<target>> and queens of whom he had read in history she was the best .::::kings
But , he had gone on to say <<target>> should be no king or queen .::::there
The practice was <<target>> absurdity .::::an
The reverence paid even to the high office was such <<target>> , in his idea , degraded a man .::::as
Even in America , the Kotooing which took place before <<target>> President 's toe was to him an abomination .::::the
No man in accordance with his <<target>> should worship another man .::::theory
Titles should only be used as indicative <<target>> a man 's trade or occupation .::::of
As one man was Mr. General Grant , <<target>> man should be Mr. Bricklayer Green .::::another
He could not do <<target>> with the Queen .::::away
But for the woman , he <<target>> quite disposed to worship her .::::was
All women were to be worshipped , and it was <<target>> privilege of a man to worship a woman .::::a
When a woman possessed so many virtues as did the Queen of <<target>> , it became a man 's duty to worship them .::::england
But it was a woman whom he <<target>> worship , and not the Queen .::::would
He had made Galway a kind of centre home , attracted thither by <<target>> friendship which his daughter had made with Ada and Edith Jones .::::the
For though Ada and Edith were by no means Republican in their thoughts and feelings , <<target>> had come to pass that they dearly loved the American girl who was so .::::it
Rachel O'Mahony had frequently been at Morony Castle , as had also her father ; and Mr. Jones had taken delight in <<target>> the arguments of the American , because , as he had said , the American had been unselfish and true .::::controverting
But since his lecturing had been stopped , it had become necessary that he should go elsewhere to look for means of livelihood , and <<target>> had now betaken himself to London for that purpose , -- a circumstance which will be explained at greater length as the story progresses .::::he
Republicanism was not the only matter in his <<target>> creed to which Gerald O'Mahony was devoted .::::political
Though he was no Irishman , as he delighted to intimate , his heart was Irish ; and <<target>> his various visits to the country , he had filled his bosom with thoughts of Irish wrongs .::::during
No educated man was ever born and bred in more utter <<target>> of all political truths than this amiable and philanthropic gentleman .::::ignorance
In regard to Ireland his theory was that the land should be taken <<target>> the present proprietors , and divided among the peasants who tilled it .::::from
When asked what should be done with the present owners , he was quite ready with <<target>> answer : `` Let them be paid for the property by the State ! ''::::his
He would have no man injured <<target>> the extent of a shilling .::::to
As for the landlords themselves , with the money in their pockets , let them <<target>> to the United States , if they were in want of something to do .::::emigrate
One man would have ten acres , and another fifty ; but that would be fair , <<target>> one man had been used to pay for ten , and another to pay for fifty .::::because
As for the men who got no land <<target>> the scramble he could see no injustice .::::in
The man who chanced to have been a tenant for the <<target>> twelve months , must take the benefit of his position .::::last
But if the land was to be given up without <<target>> rent , then he could see no injustice .::::any
Thus , and thus only , could Ireland be made to <<target>> to the beauty and the grace of her original simplicity .::::return
But on the wrongs arising from the want of Home Rule he <<target>> warmer even than on those which the land question had produced .::::was
`` Why should Ireland be governed by a British Parliament , a British Lord-Lieutenant , a <<target>> Chief-Secretary , a British Commander-in-Chief , and trodden under foot by a British soldiery ?::::british
Why should Scotland be so governed , why <<target>> Wales , why should Yorkshire ? ''::::should
Mr. Jones would reply , `` Repeal <<target>> Unions ; restore the Heptarchy ! ''::::the
Mr. O'Mahony had but a confused idea <<target>> what the Heptarchy had been .::::of
But he was sure that it would be for the benefit of <<target>> , that Irish knives should be made of Irish steel .::::ireland
`` As undoubtedly would have been the case if the question of protection were <<target>> be left to an Irish Parliament to settle , '' said Mr. Jones .::::to
`` Heaven help the man who <<target>> want to cut his mutton .::::would
His best chance would be that he would <<target>> have no mutton to cut . ''::::soon
So the dispute was carried on with much warmth on one side , <<target>> with many arguments on the other , but without any quarrelling .::::and
It was impossible to quarrel with O'Mahony , who <<target>> thoroughly unselfish , and desirous of no violence .::::was
When he had heard what had been done in reference to Mr. Jones 's meadows , and had been told of the suspected <<target>> of Pat Carroll , he was as indignant as though he had himself been a landed proprietor , or even an Orangeman .::::conduct
And on Mr. Jones 's part there was a desire to do justice to <<target>> around him , which came within the capacity of O'Mahony 's vision .::::all
From this , passengers are landed , so that the means of <<target>> between Galway and Mr. Jones 's house are peculiarly easy .::::transit
Up and down by this steamer Ada and Edith Jones had frequently gone to <<target>> their friend , and as frequently that friend had come to visit them .::::visit
But unfortunately the steamer had been open to others besides the young ladies , and <<target>> O'Mahony had found a dearer friend than either of the girls at Morony Castle .::::rachel
It had come to pass that Frank Jones and <<target>> O'Mahony had declared themselves to be engaged .::::rachel
On no such ground as want of wealth , or want of family , or want of education , had Mr. Jones based <<target>> objection to the match ; but there had been a peculiarity in the position of Rachel which had made him hesitate .::::his
It was not that she was an <<target>> , but such an American !::::american
It was not that he was a <<target>> , but such a Republican !::::republican
And she was more anxious to carry Frank away with her to the United States , and to join <<target>> in a political partnership with her father , than to come and settle herself down at the Castle .::::him
Thus there had arisen an understanding on the part of the young people , that , though <<target>> were engaged , they were engaged without the consent of the young man 's father .::::they
Rachel therefore was not to be brought <<target>> the Castle while Frank was there .::::to
To all this Rachel 's father had assented , in a smiling <<target>> manner , half intended to ridicule all who were concerned .::::indifferent
As it was not a question of politics , Mr. O'Mahony could not work <<target>> up to any anger , or apparently even to anxiety in the matter .::::himself
`` Your young people are just as fond of what money <<target>> buy as are ours , '' said Mr. Jones .::::will
`` But they are fonder of one <<target>> , even , than of money .::::another
When they love one <<target>> they become engaged .::::another
And as a rule <<target>> do n't starve .::::they
As a rule people with <<target>> seldom do starve .::::us
As for making out an income for a young man to start <<target>> , that with us is quite out of the question .::::with
Frank some day will <<target>> this property . ''::::have
`` That wo n't give him much of an income , '' said Mr. Jones , <<target>> since the affair of the flood had become very despondent in reference to the estate .::::who
`` Then he 's as well off now as ever he <<target>> be , and might as well marry the girl . ''::::will
But all this was <<target>> with no eagerness .::::said
`` They are merely boy and girl <<target>> yet , '' said Mr. Jones .::::as
`` I was married , and Rachel was <<target>> before I was Frank 's age . ''::::born
So saying , Mr. O'Mahony consented to come to Morony Castle , <<target>> bid them adieu , without bringing his girl with him .::::and
This was hard upon Ada and Edith , as Mr. Frank , of course , went <<target>> Galway as often as he pleased , and made his adieu after his own fashion .::::into
And there had come up another cause which had created <<target>> objections to the marriage in Mr. Jones 's mind .::::further
Mr. O'Mahony had declared that as his lecturing was brought to an end by the <<target>> , he must throw himself upon Rachel 's capabilities for earning some money .::::police
Rachel 's capabilities had been often discussed at the Castle , but with <<target>> feelings on the three sides into which the party had formed themselves .::::various
All the Jones 's were on one side , and <<target>> that the capability had better not be exercised .::::declared
They had lived for many <<target>> away from London .::::years
The children had so lived all their lives ; and they conceived that prejudices <<target>> existed which had now been banished or nearly banished from the world .::::still
Mr. O'Mahony , who formed another party , thought <<target>> the matter was one of supreme indifference .::::that
As long as he could earn money by lecturing <<target>> was well that he should earn it .::::it
It was always better that the men of a family should work than the women ; but , if the <<target>> 's talent was of no use , then it might be well to fall back upon the woman .::::man
He only laughed at the existence <<target>> a prejudice in the matter .::::of
He himself had <<target>> prejudices .::::no
He regarded all prejudices as the <<target>> of folly over education .::::triumph
But Rachel , who was the third party in the <<target>> , had a very strong feeling of her own .::::discussion
She was of opinion that if the capability in <<target>> existed , it ought to be exercised .::::question
But if the capability existed it <<target>> ought to be used .::::certainly
That was Rachel 's opinion , expressed with all the <<target>> which she knew how to throw into the subject .::::vigour
This capability had already been exercised in New York , where it <<target>> been efficacious , though the effect had not been great .::::had
She had been brought up to sing , and <<target>> things had been promised of her voice .::::great
An American manager had thought much of her performance , though she had hitherto , he <<target>> , been young , and had not come to the strength of her throat .::::said
But he had himself seen to her education , almost as a child , and had <<target>> sure that sooner or later she would do great things in the musical world .::::been
That such a voice as Rachel O'Mahony 's should be lost to the world , was to his thinking a profanity , an indecency , an iniquity , a wasting of <<target>> 's choicest gifts , and an abomination not to be thought of ; for Mr. Mahomet M. Moss was in the affairs of his own profession a most energetic gentleman .::::god
Rachel rather turned up her nose at Mr. Mahomet M. Moss ; but she was very anxious to go to London and to take her chance , and to do something , <<target>> she said , laughing , just to keep her father 's pot a little on the boil ; -- but for Mr. Mahomet M. Moss she did not care one straw .::::as
Mr. O'Mahony was therefore ready to start on the journey , and had <<target>> come to Morony Castle to say farewell to his friend Mr. Jones .::::now
`` Are you sure about <<target>> fellow Moss ? ''::::that
`` What do you <<target>> sure about him ?::::call
He 's as big a swindler , I guess , <<target>> you shall find from here to himself . ''::::as
`` And are you going to <<target>> Rachel into his hands ? ''::::put
He 'll swindle her out of three parts of what she <<target>> ; -- but she 'll get the fourth part .::::earns

`` I do n't <<target>> about money .::::mean
Will you leave her conduct <<target>> his hands ? ''::::in
I guess she 'll <<target>> herself mostly . ''::::conduct
`` You 'll be there to be <<target>> , '' said Mr. Jones .::::sure
`` I know pretty well <<target>> you would be saying .::::what
Our young folk grow old quicker <<target>> long sight than yours do .::::a
Now your girls here are as sweet <<target>> primroses out of the wood .::::as
But Rachel is like a rose that has been <<target>> up to stand firm on its own bush .::::brought
I 'm not a <<target>> afraid of her .::::bit
Nor yet is <<target>> son .::::your
She looks as though you might blow her <<target>> with the breath from your mouth .::::away

`` Does not a young girl lose something of the aroma of <<target>> youth by seeing too much of the world too soon ? ''::::her
`` How old do you expect her to <<target>> when she 's to die ? ''::::be
She is only as yet entering upon life , <<target>> her health seems to be quite confirmed . ''::::and
`` The best confirmed I <<target>> knew in my life .::::ever
She never has a <<target>> 's illness .::::day
Taking all the chances one way and <<target>> , shall we say sixty ? ''::::another
`` More than that , I should <<target>> , '' said Mr. Jones .::::think
She may fall down a trap in the theatre , <<target>> be drowned in one of your Cunarders . ''::::or
`` The Cunard steamers never drown <<target>> , '' said Mr. Jones .::::anybody
`` Well , then , a White Star -- <<target>> any cockle-shell you may please to name .::::or
We 'll put her down for <<target>> as an average . ''::::sixty
`` I do n't know what you are <<target>> at , '' said Mr. Jones .::::driving
`` She has lived a third of her life already , and you expect <<target>> to know nothing , so that the aroma may still cling to her .::::her
Aroma does very well for earls ' daughters and young marchionesses , though as <<target>> as I can learn , it 's going out of fashion with them .::::far
She 's got to look to her conduct , <<target>> to be sharp at the same time .::::and
Mr. Mahomet M. Moss will rob her of seventy-five cents <<target>> of every dollar for the next twelve months .::::out

Marvels are not natural , <<target>> we are marvellous people .::::and
I do n't know much about aroma , but I think you 'll find Rachel <<target>> come out of the washing without losing much colour in the process . ''::::will
Then the two friends parted , and Mr. O'Mahony went <<target>> to Galway , preparatory to his journey to London .::::back
On the day following that of O'Mahony 's return to Galway , he , and his daughter , and <<target>> Jones were together at the Galway Station preparatory to the departure of the O'Mahonys for Dublin and London .::::frank
Rachel O'Mahony had not been badly described when her father said of <<target>> that she looked as though she might be blown away .::::her
She was very fair , and <<target>> and frail to look at .::::small
But though this too , was <<target>> , she hardly looked it .::::true
And the colour on her face was so evanescent that he who watched <<target>> was inclined to think that she herself was like her colour .::::her
And she moved as though she <<target>> always on the vanishing point .::::was
There was nothing she would not attempt to <<target>> in the way of taking exercise .::::do
She would undertake very long walks , and would then fail , and declare that she must be carried home ; <<target>> she would finally get through the day 's work better than another woman who appeared to have double her strength .::::but
Her feet and hands were the tiniest little adjuncts to <<target>> grown human body that could be seen anywhere .::::a
They looked at least <<target>> be so .::::to
But they were in perfect symmetry <<target>> her legs and arms .::::with
`` I wish I were bigger , '' she had once been <<target>> to say , `` because I could hit a man . ''::::heard
The man to whom she alluded <<target>> Mr. Mahomet M. Moss .::::was
`` I sometimes want to hit a woman , <<target>> that would be such a small triumph . ''::::but
And yet she had a pride <<target>> her little female fineries .::::in
`` Now , Frank , '' she had once said , `` I guess you wo n't get another <<target>> in all Galway to put her foot into that boot ; nor yet in New York either . ''::::woman
`` You 'd better take it to New York and try , and <<target>> you find the lady you can bring her back with you . ''::::if
Frank refused the commission , saying something of course <<target>> pretty as to his mistress 's foot .::::very
These only have eight , '' she said , objecting <<target>> a present which her lover had just brought her .::::to
`` If I had ten buttons , and the gloves to fit me , <<target>> 'd cut my arm off and put it under a glass case .::::i
Lovers are sent out to do all possible and <<target>> things in order to deserve their lady-loves .::::impossible
You shall go and wander about till you find a glove with ten buttons to <<target>> me , then I 'll consent to be Mrs. -- -- Jones . ''::::fit
By all of which little manoeuvres Frank was <<target>> and oppressed to the last degree .::::charmed
When she would call herself the `` future Mrs. -- -- Jones , '' <<target>> would almost feel inclined to abandon both the name and the property .::::he
`` Why not be Mrs. Morony , '' <<target>> would say , `` or Mrs. Ballintubber ?::::rachel
The Ballintubber , of Ballintubber , would sound exquisitely , <<target>> then I should always be called 'Madam . ' ''::::and
Her beauty was all but perfect , as far as symmetry was concerned , only that there was not enough of it ; and <<target>> the perfection of female beauty a tone of colour is , methinks , needed somewhat darker than that which prevailed with Rachel O'Mahony .::::for
Her hair was so light that one felt it rather <<target>> saw it , as one feels the sunlight .::::than
It was soft and feathery , as is the under <<target>> on the wings of some small tropical birds .::::plumage
`` A lock of <<target>> hair ! ''::::my
she had once said to Frank ; `` <<target>> it will all go into nothing .::::but
You should have paid your vows to some girl who could give <<target>> a good lump of hair fit to stuff a pillow with .::::you
If you have mine you will think in a few weeks that <<target>> spiders have been there and have left their dust behind . ''::::the
But she gave him the lock of hair , and <<target>> it on his lips with her own little hands .::::laid
There was not enough <<target>> her beauty .::::of
Even in touching her a lover could not but feel <<target>> he had to deal with a little child .::::that
In looking at her he could <<target>> look down upon her .::::only
It was not till she spoke , and that her words came to his assistance , <<target>> he found that he had to deal with one who was not altogether a child .::::that
`` Mr. Mahomet M. Moss declares his opinion <<target>> I shall be seen above the gaslights .::::that
Mahomet M. M. did not seem <<target>> think of this . ''::::to
Since Frank had known her she had taken every opportunity in her power of <<target>> Mahomet M. M. , as she was wont to call Mr. Moss .::::belittling
Frank Jones was , in truth , a handsome stalwart young man , clever enough for the world , who <<target>> a good deal of himself , and who thought very much more of the girl whom he loved .::::thought
It was chiefly because he was absolutely unlike an <<target>> that Rachel O'Mahony had come to love him .::::american
Who does not know the `` got up '' look of the gentleman from the other side of the water , who seems to know himself to be much better than his father , and infinitely <<target>> to his grandfather ; who is always ready to make a speech on every occasion , and who feels himself to be fit company for a Prime Minister as soon as he has left school .::::superior
Young Jones was not so ; and it was <<target>> account of this deficiency that Rachel prized him .::::on
`` I 'm not like a young girl myself , '' she had said <<target>> her father , `` but I do love a jolly nice boy .::::to
With us at sixteen , they are all but decrepit old <<target>> , and yet they are such little monkeys . ''::::men
`` For a little monkey , what <<target>> you think of yourself ? ''::::do
But the conversation then had <<target>> gone any further .::::not
`` I know you 'll be after me before long , '' Rachel <<target>> to Frank , as they walked up and down the platform together .::::said
`` If I do , I shall ask you <<target>> marry me at once , '' he replied .::::to
`` I shall never do that <<target>> your father 's leave . ''::::without
`` Is that the way they <<target>> things in America ? ''::::manage
`` It 's the way I shall <<target>> them here , '' said Rachel .::::manage
`` I 'm in the unfortunate position of <<target>> three papas to whom I must attend .::::having
`` You will never be incommoded much <<target>> him , '' he replied .::::by
`` He is the least potent <<target>> the three , no doubt .::::of

I obeyed without even daring to feel the slightest snub , and if I were married to-morrow , I should kiss his toe <<target>> token of respect , and with a great deal more affection than I should kiss your half-bearded lips , sir . ''::::in
Here Frank got a hold of her hand beneath <<target>> arm , and gave it a squeeze .::::his
`` He is the real old-fashioned father in the play , who is expected <<target>> come out at last with a hundred thousand dollars and his blessing . ''::::to
`` And who is <<target>> third papa ? ''::::the

He is the third papa -- if only he would <<target>> to remain in that comparatively humble position . ''::::consent
`` Mahomet M. Moss is at any rate <<target>> lord and master for the present . ''::::my

`` What does <<target>> do ?::::he
You shall not go to be subjected <<target>> such danger and such annoyance . ''::::to
She turned round , and looked up <<target>> his face as with derision .::::into

There , do you see that <<target>> old man there ? ''::::ugly
She pointed to a cross-looking old gentleman of <<target>> , who was scolding a porter violently .::::sixty

`` You never saw <<target>> before . ''::::him
`` That 's <<target>> the reason .::::just

What more do you <<target>> than that ?::::want
I do n't believe there 's another girl in New York would say <<target>> much to you , -- nor yet in County Galway . ''::::as
`` But what does he <<target>> to you ? ''::::say
`` Well ; just the kind <<target>> things that you never say .::::of

So saying , she jumped into the carriage , and the train had started before <<target>> Jones had begun to think whether he could do it there or no .::::frank

Simply because I believe him when he says he wants to <<target>> me , and make me his companion for life .::::marry

`` I always regarded him as a good-looking <<target>> man , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::young

`` I suppose <<target>> is .::::it
But if you hear that I have told him that I regard <<target>> as a disgusting monkey , you must not be surprised . ''::::him
This was the last conversation which Mr. O'Mahony and his daughter <<target>> respecting Mahomet M. Moss , till they reached London .::::had
When Mr. O'Mahony and his daughter stepped out of the train on the platform <<target>> Euston Square , they were at once encountered by Mr. Mahomet M. Moss .::::at
`` Oh , <<target>> ! ''::::dear
ejaculated Miss O'Mahony , turning <<target>> upon her father .::::back
`` Can not you get <<target>> of him ? ''::::rid
Mr. O'Mahony , without a word of reply to his <<target>> , at once greeted Mr. Moss most affectionately .::::daughter
`` Yes , my bird is <<target>> -- as you see .::::here
You have taken a great deal of <<target>> in coming to meet us . ''::::trouble
Mr. Moss begged that the trouble might be taken as being <<target>> greatest pleasure he had ever had in his life .::::the
`` Nothing could be too much <<target>> do for Miss O'Mahony . ''::::to
Would Miss O'Mahony condescend to take a seat <<target>> the carriage which was waiting for her ?::::in
She had not spoken a word , but had <<target>> fast hold of her father 's arm .::::laid
Mr. Moss expressed his sense of the high honour which was done him by <<target>> command , but suggested that she should seat herself in the carriage .::::her
`` I will stand here under <<target>> pillar , '' she said .::::this
And as she took her stand it would have required a man with <<target>> effrontery than Mr. Moss possessed , to attempt to move her .::::more
We have seen Miss O'Mahony taking a few liberties <<target>> her lover , but still very affectionate .::::with
And we have seen her enjoying the <<target>> of perfect equality with her papa .::::badinage
There was nothing then of the <<target>> young lady about her .::::ferocious
Miss O'Mahony appeared to <<target>> one of them .::::be
They all seated themselves in the carriage with their small parcels , leaving their luggage <<target>> come after them in a cab which Mr. Moss had had allowed to him .::::to
But they , the O'Mahonys , <<target>> nothing of their immediate destination .::::knew
It had been clearly the father 's business to ask ; <<target>> he was a man possessed of no presence of mind .::::but
Suddenly the idea struck Rachel , and she called out with a loud <<target>> , `` Father , where on earth are we going ? ''::::voice
`` I suppose Mr. Moss <<target>> tell us . ''::::can
`` You are going to apartments which I have secured for <<target>> O'Mahony at considerable trouble , '' said Mr. Moss .::::miss
`` The theatres are <<target>> stirring . ''::::all
`` But we are not going <<target>> live in a theatre . ''::::to
`` The ladies of the theatres <<target>> only one situation convenient .::::find
They must live somewhere in <<target>> neighbourhood of the Strand .::::the
I have secured two sitting-rooms and two bedrooms on the <<target>> floor , overlooking the views at Brown 's . ''::::first
`` Wo n't they <<target>> money ? ''::::cost
`` What fools <<target>> have been !::::we
We intended to go to some inn for one night till we <<target>> find a fitting place , -- somewhere about Gower Street . ''::::could
`` Gower Street would n't do at <<target>> , '' said Mr. Moss .::::all
`` The distance from everything <<target>> be very great . ''::::would
Two ideas passed at that <<target>> through Rachel 's mind .::::moment
The first was that the distance might serve to keep Mr. Moss out of her sitting-room , and the second <<target>> that were she to succeed in doing this , she might be forced to go to his sitting-room .::::was
`` I think Gower Street would be found <<target>> be inconvenient , Miss O'Mahony . ''::::to
`` Bloomsbury Square <<target>> very near .::::is
Here we are <<target>> the hotel .::::at
Now , father , before you have anything taken <<target>> the carriages , ask the prices . ''::::off
Then Mr. Moss , still keeping his <<target>> , made a little speech .::::seat
`` I think if Miss O'Mahony would allow me , <<target>> would counsel her against too rigid an economy .::::i
`` 'Cut your coat according to your cloth , ' I have heard of that <<target>> ; and I have heard of 'Burning a candle at both ends . ' ''::::too
`` 'You should n't spoil your ship for a ha'porth of tar , ' '' said Mr. Moss <<target>> a smile , which showed his idea , that he had the best of the argument .::::with
`` It wo n't matter for one night , '' <<target>> Mr. O'Mahony , getting out of the carriage .::::said
Half the packages had been <<target>> taken off the cab .::::already
Rachel followed her father , and without attending to Mr. <<target>> got hold of her father in the street .::::moss
`` I do n't like the look of the house at all , <<target>> , you do n't know what the people would be up to .::::father
I shall never go to <<target>> in this house . ''::::sleep
It may be as well to say at once that the house was all that an <<target>> ought to be , excepting , perhaps , that the prices were a little high .::::hotel
The two sitting-rooms and the two bedrooms -- with the maid 's room , which had also been taken -- did seem to be very heavy to Rachel , <<target>> knew down to a shilling -- or rather , to a dollar , as she would have said -- how much her father had in his pocket .::::who
Then a sudden thought <<target>> Miss O'Mahony .::::struck
They were still standing discussing the price in one of <<target>> sitting-rooms , and Mr. Moss was also there .::::the
`` I do n't think that he would feel <<target>> bound to interfere , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::himself
`` When a young woman is engaged to a young man it does make <<target>> difference , '' she replied , looking Mr. Moss full in the face .::::a
`` The happy man , '' said Mr. Moss , still bowing and smiling , `` <<target>> not be so unreasonable as to interfere with the career of his fair _fiancÃ©e_ . ''::::would
`` If we stay here very long , '' said Rachel , still addressing <<target>> father , `` I guess we should have to pawn our watches .::::her
I am awfully tired now , and should so like <<target>> have a cup of tea -- by ourselves . ''::::to
Then Mr. Moss took his leave , promising to appear again <<target>> the scene at eleven o'clock on the following day .::::upon
`` What is the use of your carrying <<target>> like that with the man ? ''::::on
`` Because he 's <<target>> beast . ''::::a
He 's not a beast that you <<target>> to treat in that way .::::ought

Then again they remained silent , and Mr. O'Mahony pretended <<target>> go to sleep -- and eventually did do so .::::to
He devoted himself for the time to Home Rule , and got himself <<target>> a frame of mind in which he really thought of Ireland .::::into
`` The first flower of the earth , <<target>> first gem of the sea . ''::::and
Why should she <<target>> be so ?::::not
She had all the sentiment necessary , all the <<target>> , all the eloquence , all the wit .::::poetry
And then when he was beginning to think whether something more than <<target>> and eloquence were not necessary , he went to sleep .::::sentiment
But Rachel was <<target>> sleeping .::::not
She had been told that she could sing , and <<target>> had sung at New York with great applause .::::she
And she had gone on studying , or <<target>> practising , the art with great diligence .::::rather
She had already become aware that <<target>> was more needed than study .::::practice
All , nearly all , this man could <<target>> her was to open her mouth .::::teach
Nature had given her an ear , and a voice , <<target>> she would work hard so as to use it .::::if
It was there <<target>> her .::::before
But it had seemed to her that her career <<target>> clogged with the necessary burden of Mr. Moss .::::was
Mr. Moss had got hold of her , <<target>> how should she get rid of him ?::::and
And then there was present to her <<target>> a vision of Frank Jones .::::alone
To live at Morony Castle and be Frank Jones 's wife , would not that be <<target>> than to sing at a theatre under the care of Mr. Mahomet M. Moss ?::::sweeter
All the sweetness of a country life in a pleasant house by the lake side , and a husband with her who would endure all <<target>> little petulancy , and vagaries , and excesses of her wayward but affectionate temper , all these things were present to her mind .::::the
And to be Mistress Jones , who could look all the world in the face , this -- as compared with the gaslight of a <<target>> , which might mean failure , and could only mean gaslight -- this , on the present occasion , did tempt her sorely .::::theatre
Her moods were <<target>> various .::::very
There were moments of her life when the gaslight had its charm , and in which she declared <<target>> herself that she was willing to run all the chances of failure for the hope of success .::::to
There were moments in which Mr. Moss <<target>> less odious before her eyes .::::loomed
Should she be afraid of Mr. Moss , and <<target>> from her destiny because a man was greasy ?::::fly
And to this view of her circumstances she always came at <<target>> when her father 's condition pressed itself upon her .::::last
The house beside the lake was not her own as yet , <<target>> would it be her husband 's when she was married .::::nor
Nor could there be a home for her father there as long as old Mr. <<target>> was alive , nor possibly when his son should come to the throne .::::jones
She had declared to herself that she could not go back to <<target>> United States unless she could go back as a successful singer .::::the
For these reasons she resolved that she would <<target>> Mr. Moss bravely and all his horrors .::::face
`` If that gentleman comes here to-morrow at eleven , show <<target>> up here , '' she said to the waiter .::::him
`` Yes , Mr. Moss , '' she answered in a <<target>> voice , which told the man much of her story .::::loud

As far as I can make it out , <<target>> expenses here will be about Â£17 10s .::::our

They ordered breakfast at nine , so that , as Rachel said , the heavy mutton-chop might not <<target>> sticking in her throat as she attempted to show off before Mr. Moss on his arrival .::::be

Mr. Jones is apt <<target>> dislike such things .::::to
So saying she ran out of the room , and <<target>> two minutes returned , followed by her father .::::in

There is a little street close <<target>> where we can manage it .::::by
On Christmas-day Rachel O'Mahony wrote a letter <<target>> her lover at Morony Castle :::::to
What 's the use of my loving you , and thinking that <<target>> are everything , only that you are to love me ?::::you
I am quite content that <<target>> should be so .::::it
Only let it <<target>> so .::::be
You 'll ask me what reason <<target>> have to be jealous .::::i
I do think in my heart that you <<target>> that I 'm -- just perfect .::::think
And when I tell myself that it is so , I lay myself back in my chair and <<target>> at you with my lips till I am tired of kissing the space where you ai n't .::::kiss
But if I am wrong , and if you are having a good time of it with Miss Considine at Mrs. <<target>> 's ball , and are not thinking a bit of me and my kisses , what 's the use ?::::mckeon
It 's a very unfair bargain that <<target>> woman makes with a man .::::a
If I tell a fib , and am <<target>> worth having , you can always recuperate .::::not
Mr. Jones , if you treat me in <<target>> way , wo n't I punish you ?::::that
I 'll jump into the lough with a <<target>> round my neck telling the whole story .::::label
And now I must tell you <<target>> bit more of my history .::::a
We got rid of that lovely hotel , paying <<target>> 10s. , when that just earned Â£1 .::::Â£6
And I have brought <<target>> piano with me .::::the
The man at Erard 's told me that <<target>> should have it for Â£2 10s .::::i
a month , frankly owning that <<target>> hoped to get my custom .::::he
`` But Mr. Moss is <<target>> pay nothing ? ''::::to
I do n't <<target>> he will .::::think
Â£30 a year ought to be enough <<target>> the hire of a piano .::::for
So here we are established , at Â£10 a month -- <<target>> first-floor , with father 's bedroom behind the sitting-room .::::the
I have the room <<target>> over the sitting-room .::::upstairs
Who says -- '' <<target>> mine own ? ''::::but
Somebody does , and <<target>> repeat it .::::i
They are mine own , at <<target>> rate till next Saturday .::::any
And we have settled this <<target>> engagement and signed it .::::terrible
I 'm to sing for Moss at `` The Embankment '' <<target>> four months , at the rate of Â£600 a year .::::for
It was a Jew 's bargain , for I <<target>> had filled the house for a fortnight .::::really
There is a nasty muddy rheumatic sound about it ; but it 's <<target>> prettily got up , and the exits and entrances are also good .::::very
Father goes with me every night , but I <<target>> to let him off the terrible task soon .::::mean
He smiles , and <<target>> he likes it .::::says
I only tell him he would <<target>> a child if he did .::::be
They want to change the piece , but I shall make them pay me for <<target>> dresses ; I am not going to wear any other woman 's old clothes .::::my
It 's not the proper way to begin , you <<target>> to begin as a slave or as an empress .::::have
Of course , anybody prefers <<target>> do the empress .::::to
They try , and then they <<target>> , and tumble down .::::fail
I shall tumble down , no doubt ; <<target>> I may as well have my chance .::::but
And now I 'm going to make <<target>> say that I 'm a beast .::::you
I make a little use of Mahomet M. M. 's passion to <<target>> my throne instead of taking up at once with serfdom .::::achieve
But I do it without vouchsafing him <<target>> the first corner of a smile .::::even
The harshest treatment is <<target>> that he gets .::::all
Men such as Mahomet M. will live on harsh treatment for <<target>> while , looking forward to revenge when their time comes .::::a
But I shall soon have made sure of my throne , or shall have failed ; and in either case shall cease to care for Mahomet M. By bullying <<target>> and by treating him as dust beneath my feet , I can do something to show how proud I am , and how sure I am of success .::::him
He offers me money -- not paid money <<target>> , which would have certain allurements .::::down
I should n't <<target>> it .::::take
I need n't <<target>> you that .::::tell
I should like to have plenty of loose sovereigns , so as to hire broughams from the yard , <<target>> of walking , or going in a 'bus about London , which is very upsetting to my pride .::::instead
Father and I go down to the theatre in <<target>> hansom , when we feel ourselves quite smart .::::a
But it is n't money <<target>> that which he offers .::::like
He wants to pay me a month in advance , and suggests that I shall <<target>> into debt , and come to him to get me out of it .::::get
`` Thank you , Mr. Moss , '' I said , `` but I 'm <<target>> sure I should want any looking after , only for such as you . ''::::not
Those are the very words I spoke , <<target>> I looked him full in the face .::::and
`` Why , what do <<target>> expect from me ? ''::::you
And then we are playing the two <<target>> at `` The Embankment . ''::::lovers
Is n't it a <<target>> family history ?::::pretty
He said nothing at the moment , but came back in <<target>> an hour to make some unnecessary remarks about the part .::::half
`` Why did you say just <<target>> that I insulted you ? ''::::now
`` Never , <<target>> ! ''::::never
he exclaimed , with <<target>> grotesque energy .::::most
`` I have never <<target>> you . ''::::insulted

If you knew the sort of feeling I have for him -- such <<target>> you would have if you found a cockroach in your dressing-case .::::as
Of course in our life young women have to put up with <<target>> kind of thing , and some of them like it .::::this
I make constant use of your name , telling everybody that I <<target>> the future Mrs. Jones , putting such weight upon the Jones .::::am
With me he knows that it is an insult ; but I do n't want to <<target>> with him if I can help it , and therefore I softened it down .::::quarrel
Knowing that , you ought n't to <<target>> to me as you do . ''::::speak
`` Why , what <<target>> I say ? ''::::do
You should have seen his grin as he asked me ; such a leer of <<target>> , as though he knew that he were getting the better of me .::::triumph
`` Mr. Jones would n't approve if <<target>> were to see it . ''::::he
Oh , if you knew how willingly I 'd stand at a tub and wash your <<target>> , while the very touch of his gloves makes me creep all over with horror .::::shirts
`` Let us have peace for <<target>> future , '' I said .::::the
`` I dislike <<target>> those familiarities .::::all
If you will only give them up we shall <<target>> on like a house on fire . ''::::go
Then the beast made an attempt to squeeze my <<target>> as he went out of the room .::::hand
You are not to come over , <<target>> happens , until I tell you .::::whatever
You ought to know very well by this time that I can fight my battles by myself ; and <<target>> you did come , there would be an end altogether to the Â£200 which I am earning .::::if
To give him his due , he 's very punctual with his money , only <<target>> he wants to pay me in advance , which I will never have .::::that
He has been liberal about my dresses , telling me to order just what <<target>> want , and have the bill sent in to the costume manager .::::i
When I have worn them they <<target>> the property of the theatre .::::become

Not but what I do care about the people ; only how am I to know whether they ought <<target>> be allowed to make their own petticoats , or why it is that they do n't do so ?::::to
He says it 's the London Parliament ; and that if they had members in College Green , <<target>> young women would go to work at once , and make petticoats for all the world .::::the
I do n't understand it , and wish <<target>> he had someone else to lecture to .::::that

I fear , I fear , that poor Florian has been fibbing , and that there <<target>> be no peace for him or for your father till the truth has been told .::::will

Of course you would n't like to see him , but then you <<target>> the comfort of knowing that I do n't like it either .::::have

Of course you want me to hate the <<target>> , and I do hate him .::::pig

Frank Jones received his letter just as he was about to leave Castle Morony for the <<target>> at Ballytowngal , the seat , as everybody knows , of Sir Nicholas Bodkin .::::meet
Sir Nicholas is known all through the West of Ireland , <<target>> a sporting man , and is held in high esteem .::::as
But there is , I think , something different in the estimation <<target>> he now enjoys from that which he possessed twenty years ago .::::which
He was then , as now , a Roman Catholic , -- as were also his wife and children ; and , as a Roman Catholic , he was more popular with the <<target>> classes , and with the priests , who are their natural friends , than with his brother grand-jurors of the country , who were , for the most part , Protestants .::::lower
Sir Nicholas is now sixty years old , and when he came to the <<target>> at thirty , he was regarded certainly as a poor man 's friend .::::title
He always lived <<target>> the estate .::::on
He rarely went up to Dublin , except for a fortnight , when the <<target>> was over , and when he paid his respects to the Lord Lieutenant .::::hunting
The house at Ballytowngal was said , in those days , to <<target>> as well kept up as any mansion in County Galway .::::be
But the saying came probably from those who were <<target>> intimate in the more gloriously maintained mansions .::::not
Sir Nicholas had Â£5000 a year , and though he did manage <<target>> pay his bills annually , spent every shilling of it .::::to
He preserved his foxes loyally , and was quite as keen about the fishing of a <<target>> river that he owned , and which ran down from his demesne into Lough Corrib .::::little
He was particular also about his snipe , and would boast that in a little spinney <<target>> Ballytowngal were to be met the earliest woodcock found in the West of Ireland .::::at
He was a thorough sportsman ; -- but a Roman Catholic -- and as a <<target>> Catholic he was hardly equal in standing to some of his Protestant neighbours .::::roman
He voted for Major Stackpoole , when Major Stackpoole stood for the county on the Liberal interest , <<target>> was once requested to come forward himself , and stand for the City as a Roman Catholic .::::and
This he did not do , being a prudent man ; but at that period , from twenty to thirty years <<target>> , he was certainly regarded as inferior to a Protestant by many of the Protestant gentlemen of the country .::::ago
But things are <<target>> now .::::changed
Sir Nicholas 's neighbours , such of them at least that <<target>> Protestants , regard Sir Nicholas as equal to themselves .::::are
He is , in fact , one of themselves as a county <<target>> , and the question of religion has gone altogether into abeyance .::::gentleman
Had you known the county thirty years ago , and had now heard Sir Nicholas talking <<target>> county matters , you would think that he was one of the old Protestants .::::of
It was so that the rich people regarded <<target>> , -- and so also the poor .::::him
But Sir Nicholas had <<target>> varied at all .::::not
He liked to get his rents paid , and as long as <<target>> tenants would pay them , he was at one with them .::::his
They had begun now to have opinions of their own upon the <<target>> , and he was at one with them no longer .::::subject
Frank Jones had heard in Galway , that there was <<target>> be a difficulty about drawing the Ballytowngal coverts .::::to
The hounds were to be allowed to draw the demesne <<target>> , but beyond that they were to be interrupted .::::coverts
Foxes seldom broke from Ballytowngal , or <<target>> they did they ran to Moytubber .::::if
At Moytubber the hounds would probably change , -- or would <<target>> so if allowed to continue their sport in peace .::::do
But at Moytubber the <<target>> would begin .::::row
Knowing this , Frank Jones was anxious to leave his home in time , as he <<target>> aware that the hounds would be carried on to Moytubber as quickly as possible .::::was
Black Daly had sworn a solemn oath that he would draw Moytubber <<target>> the teeth of every Home-Ruler and Land Leaguer in County Galway .::::in
A word or two must be said descriptive of Black Daly , <<target>> he was called , the master of the Galway hounds .::::as
They used to be called the Galway blazers , but the name had nearly dropped out <<target>> fashion since Black Daly had become their master , a quarter of a century since .::::of
Who Black Daly was or whence he had come , many <<target>> , even in County Galway , did not know .::::men
It was not that he had no property , but that his property was so small , as <<target>> make it seem improbable that the owner of it should be the master of the county hounds .::::to
But in truth Black Daly lived at Daly 's Bridge , in the <<target>> of Castle Blakeney , when he was supposed to be at home .::::neighbourhood
And the house in which he lived <<target>> had undoubtedly inherited from his father .::::he
But he was not often there , and kept his kennels <<target>> Ahaseragh , five miles away from Daly 's Bridge .::::at
Much was not therefore known of Mr. <<target>> , in his own house .::::daly
But in the field no man was better known , or <<target>> popular , if thorough obedience is an element of popularity .::::more
The old gentry of the county could tell why Mr. Daly had been put into his present <<target>> five-and-twenty years ago ; but the manner of his election was not often talked about .::::situation
He had no money , and very few acres <<target>> his own on which to preserve foxes .::::of
He had never done anything to earn a shilling since he had been born , <<target>> he may have been said to have earned shillings by his present occupation .::::unless
As he got his living out of it , he <<target>> may have been said to have done so .::::certainly
He never borrowed a shilling from any <<target>> , and certainly paid his way .::::man
But if he told a young man that he ought <<target>> buy a horse the young man certainly bought it .::::to
And if he told a young man that he must pay <<target>> certain price , the young man generally paid it .::::a
But if the young man were not ready with his money by the <<target>> fixed , that young man generally had a bad time of it .::::day
Young men have been known to be driven not only out of County Galway , but out of Ireland <<target>> , by the tone of Mr. Daly 's voice , and by the blackness of his frown .::::itself
And yet it was said generally that neither young men nor <<target>> men were injured in their dealings with Mr. Daly .::::old
`` That horse wo n't be much the worse for his splint , and <<target>> 's worth Â£70 to you , because you can ride him ten stone .::::he
You had better give me <<target>> for him . ''::::Â£70
Then the young man would promise the Â£70 in three months ' time , <<target>> if he kept his word , would swear by Black Daly ever afterwards .::::and
In this way Mr. Daly <<target>> a great many horses .::::sold
The master had died , but the county had the <<target>> sport that winter that it had ever enjoyed .::::best
He was then known <<target>> Tom Daly .::::as
It was well understood that the cousin wished to have the hounds , <<target>> that he was thought not to have all the necessary attributes .::::but
`` I suppose the county means to pay <<target>> all sport , '' said Tom .::::for
Then the hat went round , and an <<target>> sum of Â£900 a year was voted .::::annual
Since that the hounds have gone on , and the bills have been paid ; and Tom has raised the number of <<target>> ' hunting to four a week , or has lowered it to two , according to the amount of money given .::::days
He makes no proposition now , but <<target>> what he means to do .::::declares
`` Things are dearer , '' he said last year , `` and you wo n't <<target>> above five days a fortnight , unless you can make the money up to Â£1,200 .::::have
I want Â£400 a day , <<target>> Â£400 I must have . ''::::and
The county had then voted him the money in the plenitude of <<target>> power , and Daly had hunted seven days a fortnight .::::its
But all the Galway world felt that <<target>> was about to be a fall .::::there
Black Daly was a man quite as <<target>> as his sobriquet described him .::::dark
He was tall , but very thin and bony , and seemed <<target>> to have an ounce of flesh about his face or body .::::not
He had large , black whiskers , -- coarse and jet <<target>> , -- which did not quite meet beneath his chin .::::black
And he wore no other beard , no tuft , no imperial , no moustachios ; but when he was seen before shaving on a morning , he would seem to be <<target>> all over , and his hair was black , short , and harsh ; and though black , round about his ears it was beginning to be tinged with grey .::::black
He was now over fifty years of age ; but the hair on his <<target>> was as thick as it had been when he first undertook the hounds .::::head
He had great dark eyes in his head , deep down , <<target>> that they seemed to glitter at you out of caverns .::::so
And above them were great , bushy eyebrows , every hair of <<target>> seemed to be black , and harsh , and hard .::::which
His nose was well-formed and prominent ; <<target>> of cheeks he had apparently none .::::but
Between his whiskers and his nose , and the corners of <<target>> mouth , there was nothing but two hollow cavities .::::his
He was somewhat over six feet high , but from <<target>> extraordinary thinness gave the appearance of much greater height .::::his
His arms were long , and the waistcoat which he wore was always long ; his breeches were <<target>> long ; and his boots seemed the longest thing about him -- unless his spurs seemed longer .::::very
He had no flesh about him , and it was boasted of him that , in spite <<target>> his length , and in spite of his height , he could ride under twelve stone .::::of
Of himself , and of his <<target>> , he never talked .::::doings
They were secrets of his own , of <<target>> he might have to make money .::::which
And no one had a <<target>> to ask him questions .::::right
He did not conceive that it would be necessary for a gentleman <<target>> declare his weight unless he were about to ride a race .::::to
Now it was understood that for the last <<target>> years Black Daly had ridden no races .::::ten
He was a man of whom it <<target>> be said that he never joked .::::might
Though his life was devoted in a peculiar manner to sport , and there may be thought to <<target>> something akin between the amusements and the lightness of life , it was all serious to him .::::be
Though he was bitter over it , or happy ; triumphant , or occasionally <<target>> despair -- as when the money was not forthcoming -- he never laughed .::::in
It was all serious to him , and apparently sad , from the first note of a hound in <<target>> early covert , down to the tidings that a poor fox had been found poisoned near his earth .::::the
He had much to do to find sport for the county <<target>> such limited means , and he was always doing it .::::on
He knew the constitution of each , and to <<target>> extent their noses were to be trusted .::::what
`` It 's a very heavy scent to-day , '' he <<target>> say , `` because Gaylap carries it over the plough .::::would
It 's only a catching scent because the <<target>> do n't hang on the bushes . ''::::drops
His lore on all such matters was incredible , <<target>> he would never listen to any argument .::::but
A man had a right to his own opinion ; <<target>> then the man who differed from him knew nothing .::::but
He gave out his little laws to favoured individuals ; not by way of conversation , for which he cared <<target>> , but because it might be well that the favoured individual should know the truth on that occasion .::::nothing
As a man to ride he was <<target>> complete master of his art .::::a
There was nothing which a horse could do with a man on his back , which Daly could not make <<target>> do ; and when he had ridden a horse he would know exactly what was within his power .::::him
But there was no desire with him <<target>> the showing off of a horse .::::for
He often rode to sell a horse , <<target>> he never seemed to do so .::::but
He never rode at difficult places unless driven to <<target>> so by the exigencies of the moment .::::do
He was always quiet in the field , unless when driven <<target>> express himself as to the faults of some young man .::::to
Then he could blaze forth in <<target>> anger with great power .::::his
He was constantly to be seen trotting along a road when hounds were running , <<target>> he had no desire to achieve for himself a character for hard riding .::::because
But he was always with his hounds when he was wanted , and it was boasted of him that he <<target>> ridden four days a week through the season on three horses , and had never lamed one of them .::::had
He was rarely known to have a second horse out , and when he <<target>> so , it was for some purpose peculiar to the day 's work .::::did
On such days he had <<target>> a horse to sell .::::generally
It is hardly necessary to say that <<target>> Daly was an unmarried man .::::black
No one who knew him could conceive <<target>> he should have had a wife .::::that
A wife , had she seen to the feeding of the numerous babies , would have given them too much <<target>> eat , and had she not undertaken this care , she would have been useless at Daly 's Bridge .::::to
But Barney Smith was invaluable ; double the amount of <<target>> got usually from a huntsman was done by him .::::work
There was no kennel man , no second <<target>> , no stud-groom at the Ahaseragh kennels .::::horseman
Circumstances had given him the use of the Ahaseragh kennels , which had been the property of <<target>> cousin , and circumstances had not enabled him to build others at Daly 's Bridge .::::his
Gradually he had found it easier <<target>> move himself than the hounds .::::to
And so it had come to pass that two rooms had been prepared for him close <<target>> the kennels , and that Mr. Barney Smith gave him such attendance as was necessary .::::to
Of strictly personal attendance Black Daly wanted very little ; but the discomforts of that home , while one pair of breeches were supposed <<target>> be at Daly 's Bridge , and the others at Ahaseragh , were presumed by the world at large to be very grievous .::::to
But the personal appearance of Mr. Daly on hunting <<target>> , was not a matter of indifference .::::mornings
It was not that he wore beautiful pink tops , or came out guarded from the dust by little aprons , or had his cravat just out of the bandbox , <<target>> his scarlet coat always new , and in the latest fashion , nor had his hat just come from the shop in Piccadilly with the newest twist to its rim .::::or
But there was something manly , and <<target>> powerful about his whole apparel .::::even
He was always the same , so that by men even in his <<target>> county , he would hardly have been known in other garments .::::own
The strong , broad brimmed high hat , with the cord passing down his back beneath his coat , that had known the weather of various winters ; the dark , red coat , with long swallow tails , which had grown nearly black under many storms ; the dark , buff striped waistcoat , with the stripes running downwards , long , so <<target>> to come well down over his breeches ; the breeches themselves , which were always of leather , but which had become nearly brown under the hands of Barney Smith or his wife , and the mahogany top-boots , of which the tops seemed to be a foot in length , could none of them have been worn by any but Black Daly .::::as
His very spurs must have surely been made for him , they were in <<target>> and weight ; and general strength of leather , so peculiarly his own .::::length
He was unlike other masters of hounds in this , that he never carried a horn ; but he spoke to his hounds <<target>> a loud , indistinct chirruping voice , which all County Galway believed to be understood to every hound in the park .::::in
One other fact must be <<target>> respecting Mr. Daly .::::told
He was a Protestant -- as <<target>> to a Roman Catholic .::::opposed
He was equally civil or uncivil to priest and <<target>> when priest or parson appeared in the field .::::parson
But on no account would he speak to <<target>> of them if he could avoid it .::::either
But he had in his heart a thorough conviction that all Roman Catholics ought to be regarded as enemies by <<target>> Protestants , and that the feeling was one entirely independent of faith and prayerbooks , or crosses and masses .::::all
But he was a Protestant , and Sir Nicholas Bodkin was a Roman Catholic , and therefore an enemy -- as a dog may be <<target>> to declare himself a dog , and a cat a cat , if called upon to explain the cause for the old family quarrel .::::supposed
Now there had come a cloud over his spirit <<target>> reference to the state of his country .::::in
He could see that the quarrel was not entirely one between Protestant and Catholic as it used to be , but still he <<target>> not get it out of his mind , but that the old causes were producing in a different way their old effects .::::could
Whiteboys , Terryalts , Ribbonmen , Repeaters , Physical-Forcemen , Fenians , Home-Rulers , Professors <<target>> Dynamite , and American-Irish , were , to his thinking , all the same .::::of
He never talked much about it , because he did not like to <<target>> his ignorance ; but his convictions were not the less formed .::::expose
There were certain deviations in this ordained rule <<target>> life , but they were only exceptions .::::of
The Roman Catholics had the worst of this <<target>> , and the Protestants the best .::::position
But now the advancing evil of the time was about to fall even upon <<target>> , and upon his beneficent labours , done for the world at large .::::himself
It was whispered in County Galway that the people <<target>> about to rise and interfere with fox-hunting !::::were
It may be imagined that on this special day Mr. Daly 's heart was low beneath <<target>> black-striped waistcoat , as he rode on his way to draw the coverts at Ballytowngal .::::his
At the cross-roads of Monivea he met Peter <<target>> , the eldest son of Sir Nicholas .::::bodkin
Now Peter Bodkin had quarrelled long <<target>> very bitterly with his father .::::and
Every acre of the property at Ballytowngal was entailed upon him , and Peter <<target>> thought that under such circumstances his father was not doing enough for him .::::had
The quarrel had been made up , but still the evil rankled in Peter 's bosom , who was driven to live with his <<target>> and family on Â£500 a year ; and had found himself hardly driven to keep himself out of the hands of the Jews .::::wife
His father had wished him to follow some profession , but this <<target>> been contrary to Peter 's idea of what was becoming .::::had
But though he had only Â£500 a year , and five children , he <<target>> manage to keep two horses , and saw a good deal of hunting .::::did
And among all the hunting men in County Galway he was the <<target>> who lived on the closest terms of intimacy with Black Daly .::::one
For , though he was a Roman Catholic , his religion did not trouble him much ; and <<target>> was undoubtedly on the same side with Daly in the feuds that were coming on the country .::::he
`` Well , <<target>> . ''::::peter
`` Well , Daly , '' were the greetings , as the two men <<target>> ; and then they rode on together in silence for a mile .::::met
`` Have you heard what the <<target>> are going to do ? ''::::boys
`` I suppose there 's <<target>> in it ? ''::::nothing
`` I fear <<target>> is . ''::::there
`` What will <<target>> do ? ''::::they
`` Just prevent <<target>> hunting . ''::::your
`` If they touch me , or <<target>> of the men , by God !::::either
I 'll shoot some <<target>> them . ''::::of
Then he put his hand into his pocket , <<target>> much as to explain a pistol was there .::::as
After that the two men rode on in silence <<target>> they came to the gates of Ballytowngal .::::till
Daly , among other virtues , or <<target>> , was famed for punctuality .::::vices
He wore a large silver watch in his pocket which was as true as the <<target>> , or at any rate was believed by its owner to be so .::::sun
From Daly 's watch on hunting <<target>> there was no appeal .::::mornings
He always reached the appointed meet at five minutes before eleven , by his watch , and <<target>> his watch the hounds were always moved from their haunches at five minutes past eleven .::::by
Though the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary and the Lord <<target>> had been there , there would have been no deviation .::::chancellor
The interval of ten minutes he generally spent in whispered confabulations with the earth-warners , secrets into which no attendant horseman ever <<target>> ; for Black Daly was a mysterious man , who did not choose to be inquired into as to his movements .::::dived
On this occasion he said not a word to any earth-warner , though two were in attendance ; but he sat silent and more gloomy than ever on his big <<target>> horse , waiting for the minutes to pass by till he should be able to run his hounds through the Ballytowngal coverts , and then hurry on to Moytubber .::::black
Mr. Daly 's mind was , in truth , fixed upon <<target>> , and what would there be done this morning .::::moytubber
He was a simple-minded man , who kept his <<target>> fixed for the most part on one object .::::thoughts
No man could touch him or either of his servants in the way of <<target>> without committing an offence which he would be bound to oppose by violence .::::violence
He was no lawyer , and understood not at <<target>> the statutes as fixed upon the subject .::::all
If a man laid a hand upon him violently , and would not take his <<target>> off again when desired , he would be entitled to shoot that man .::::hand
Such was the law , as in his <<target>> and manliness he believed it to exist .::::simplicity
He was a man not given to pistols ; but when he heard that he was to be stopped in his hunting on this <<target>> , and stopped by dastardly , pernicious curs who called themselves Landleaguers , he went into Ballinasloe , and bought himself a pistol .::::morning
Black Daly was a sad , serious man , who could not put up with the frivolities of life ; to whom the <<target>> of providing for that large family of children was very serious ; but he was not of his nature a quarrelsome man .::::necessity
But now he was threatened on the tenderest point ; and with much <<target>> thought had resolved that it would be his duty to quarrel .::::simpler
But just when he had spoken the word on which Barney and the <<target>> were prepared to move , Sir Nicholas trotted up to him .::::hounds
Sir Nicholas and all the sporting gentlemen of County Galway were there , whispering <<target>> each other , having collected themselves in crowds much bigger than usual .::::with
There was much whispering , and many opinions had been given as to the steps <<target>> it would be well that the hunt should take if interrupted in their sport .::::which
But at last Peter Bodkin had singled out his father , and <<target>> communicated to him the fact of Black Daly 's pistol .::::had
`` He 'll use it , as sure as eggs <<target>> eggs , '' said Peter whispering to his father .::::are
`` Then there 'll be murder , '' said Sir Nicholas , who though <<target>> good hunting neighbour had never been on very friendly terms with Mr. Daly .::::a
`` He wo n't be stopped <<target>> my calling it murder . ''::::by
Then Sir Nicholas had quickly discussed the matter <<target>> sundry other sportsmen of the neighbourhood .::::with
During the ten minutes that were allowed to them , they put their <<target>> together , and with much forethought made Mr. Persse their spokesman .::::heads
Lord Ardrahan and Sir Jasper might have seemed to take <<target>> themselves an authority which Daly would not endure .::::upon
And Blake , of Letterkenny , would have been <<target>> young to carry with him sufficient weight .::::too
Sir Nicholas himself was a Roman Catholic , and was Peter 's father , and <<target>> would have been in a scrape for having told the story of the pistol .::::peter
So Mr. Persse <<target>> himself forward .::::put
`` What do they <<target>> at Moytubber ?::::want
Nobody is doing anything <<target>> them . ''::::to
`` Of course not ; they <<target>> a set of miserable ruffians .::::are
I 'm sorry to say that there are <<target>> lot of my tenants among them .::::a
But it 's no use <<target>> that now . ''::::discussing
Mr. Persse saw what he did , and <<target>> that his hand was on the pistol .::::knew
`` We have only a minute now <<target>> decide , '' he said .::::to
`` To decide <<target>> ? ''::::what
`` There must be no <<target>> on our side . ''::::violence
Daly turned round his face upon him , and looked <<target>> him from the bottom of those two dark caverns .::::at
`` Believe me when I say it ; there <<target>> be no violence on our side . ''::::must
`` If they attempt to <<target>> my horse ? ''::::stop
`` There must be no violence on our side to bring <<target>> , or rather you , to further grief . ''::::us
I 'd shoot the man who <<target>> it , '' said Daly .::::did
`` No , no ; <<target>> there be no shooting .::::let
Were you to do so , there can be no doubt <<target>> you would be tried by a jury and -- ''::::that
`` May be so ; I have <<target>> to look that in the face .::::got
It is an accursed country in <<target>> we are living . ''::::which
`` But you would not encounter the danger in <<target>> out a trifling amusement such as this ? ''::::carrying
Daly again turned round <<target>> looked at him .::::and
Was this work of his life , this employment on which <<target>> was so conscientiously eager , to be called trifling ?::::he
Did they know the thoughts which it cost him , the hard work by <<target>> it was achieved , the days and nights which were devoted to it ?::::which
To him it was the <<target>> of his life .::::work
To those around him it was <<target>> best part of theirs .::::the
`` I will not interfere with <<target>> , '' Daly said .::::them
He alluded here to the <<target>> of hunting generally .::::enemies
He had not hunted the country so long <<target>> having had many rows with many men .::::without
Farmers , angry with him for the moment , had endeavoured to stop him as he rode upon <<target>> land ; and they had poisoned his foxes from revenge , or stolen them from cupidity .::::their
He had borne with such men , expressing the severity of his judgment chiefly by <<target>> look of his eyes ; but he had never quarrelled with them violently .::::the
They had been contemptible people whom it would <<target>> better to look at than to shoot .::::be
And he would fight with them , even <<target>> hanging should be the end of it .::::though
`` Have you a pistol <<target>> you , Daly ? ''::::with
`` Then give <<target>> me . ''::::it
If I want to use a pistol it will be better <<target>> have it in my own pocket than in yours .::::to
If I do not want to use it I can keep <<target>> myself , and no one will be the wiser . ''::::it
`` Do not <<target>> me 'Mr .::::call
Persse , ' as though you <<target>> determined to quarrel with me .::::were
It will be well that you should take advice in this <<target>> from those whom you have known all your life .::::matter
There is Sir <<target>> Bodkin -- ''::::nicholas
`` He may be one of them for all <<target>> I can tell , '' said Daly .::::that
`` Lord Ardrahan is <<target>> one of them .::::not
And Sir Jasper Lynch , and Blake of Letterkenny , they <<target>> all there , if you will speak to them .::::are
In such a matter as this it is not <<target>> your while to get into serious trouble .::::worth
To you and me hunting is a matter of much importance ; but the world <<target>> large will not regard it as one in which blood should be shed .::::at
They will come prepared to make themselves disagreeable , but if <<target>> be bloodshed it will simply be by your hands .::::there
And think what an injury you would do to your side <<target>> the question , and what a benefit to theirs ! ''::::of
`` We are regarded as the dominant party , as gentlemen who <<target>> to do what is right , and support the laws . ''::::ought
`` If I am attacked may <<target>> not defend myself ? ''::::i
`` No ; not by a <<target>> carried loaded into a hunting-field .::::pistol
You would have all the <<target>> against you . ''::::world
Then the two men <<target>> on silently together .::::rode
The hounds were drawing the woods of Ballytowngal , but had <<target>> found , and were prepared to go on to Moytubber .::::not
But , according to the Galway custom , Barney <<target>> was waiting for orders from his master .::::smith
Daly now sat stock still upon his horse for awhile , looking <<target>> the dark fringe of trees by which the park was surrounded .::::at
He was thinking , as well as he knew how to <<target>> , of the position in which he was placed .::::think
To be driven to go contrary to his fixed <<target>> by fear was a course intolerable to him .::::purpose
But to have done that which was clearly <<target>> to his party was as bad .::::injurious
And this Persse to whom he had shown his momentary anger by <<target>> him Mr. , was a man whom he greatly regarded .::::calling
There was no one in the field whose word <<target>> go further with him in hunting matters .::::would
He had clearly been rightly <<target>> as a deputation .::::chosen
But Daly knew that as he had gone to bed the previous night , and as he had got up in the morning , and as he <<target>> trotted along by Monivea cross-roads , and had met Peter Bodkin , every thought of his mind had been intent on the pistol within his pocket .::::had
To shoot a man who should lay hold of him or his horse , or <<target>> to stop his horse , had seemed to him to be bare justice .::::endeavour
But he had resolved that he would first <<target>> some spoken warning to the sinner .::::give
After that , God help the man ; for <<target>> would find no help in Black Tom Daly .::::he
But now his mind was shaken <<target>> the admonitions of Mr. Persse .::::by
He could not say of Mr. Persse as he had said , most <<target>> , of Sir Nicholas , that he was one of them .::::unjustly
Mr. Persse was well-known as a Tory and a <<target>> , and an indefatigable opponent of Home-Rulers .::::protestant
`` I will keep the pistol in my pocket , '' said Tom <<target>> , without turning his eyes away from the belt of trees .::::daly
`` Had you not better <<target>> it with me ? ''::::trust
`` No , I am not such an idiot as to <<target>> a man when I do not intend it . ''::::shoot
`` Seeing how moved you are , I thought that <<target>> the pistol might be safer in my hands . ''::::perhaps
`` No , the pistol <<target>> remain with me . ''::::shall
Then he turned round to join Barney Smith , who was <<target>> for him up by the gate out of the covert .::::waiting
But he turned again to say <<target>> word to Mr. Persse .::::a
`` Thank you , Persse , <<target>> am obliged to you .::::i
It might be inconvenient being locked up <<target>> the season is over . ''::::before
Then a weird grin covered his face ; which was the <<target>> approach to laughter ever seen with Black Tom Daly .::::nearest
From Ballytowngal to Moytubber was about <<target>> mile and a half .::::a
But the crowd of horsemen had remained <<target>> their eyes fixed upon Daly .::::with
Then two or three clustered round Mr. <<target>> , asking him whispered questions .::::persse
`` It 'll be all right , '' said Persse , <<target>> his head ; and so the _cortÃ¨ge_ passed on .::::nodding
But not a word was spoken by Daly himself , either then or <<target>> , except a whispered order or two given to Barney Smith .::::afterwards
Moytubber is a gorse covert lying about three hundred yards from the road , <<target>> through it the horsemen always passed ; on other occasions it was locked .::::and
`` What 's all <<target>> about ? ''::::this
said Tom as he rode up the covert side , <<target>> addressing a man whose face he happened to know .::::and
But he was one who simply thought that his bread might <<target>> better buttered for him on that side of the question .::::be
He was not an ardent politician ; <<target>> few local Irishmen were so .::::but
Had no stirring spirits been wafted across the waters from America to teach Irishmen that one man is <<target>> good as another , or generally better , Kit Mooney would never have found it out .::::as
Had not his zeal been awakened by the eloquence of Mr. O'Meagher , the member for Athlone , who had just made a grand speech to the people at Athenry , Kit Mooney would have gone on in his old ways , <<target>> would at this moment have been touching his hat to Tom Daly , and whispering to him of the fox that had lately been seen `` staling away jist there , Mr. Daly , 'fore a'most yer very eyes . ''::::and
But Mr. O'Meagher had spent three glorious weeks in New York , and , having practised the art of speaking on board the steamer as <<target>> returned , had come to Athenry and filled the mind of Kit Mooney and sundry others with political truth of the deepest dye .::::he
But the gist of the truths so taught had been chiefly this : -- that if a man did not pay his rent , but kept his money <<target>> his pocket , he manifestly did two good things ; he enriched himself , and he so far pauperised the landlord , who was naturally his enemy .::::in
What other teaching could be necessary to make Kit understand , -- Kit Mooney who held twenty acres of meadow <<target>> convenient to the town of Claregalway , -- that this was the way to thrive in the world ?::::land
Every man owns the <<target>> which he cultivates .::::fields
Why should you here allow yourself to be <<target>> by the unmanly name of tenants ?::::degraded
The earth which supports you should be as free <<target>> you as the air you breathe . ''::::to
Such had been the eloquence of Mr. O'Meagher ; and it had stirred the mind of <<target>> Mooney and made him feel that life should be recommenced by him under new principles .::::kit
Things had not quite gone swimmingly with him since , because Nicholas Bodkin 's agent had caused a sheriff 's bailiff to appear upon <<target>> scene , and the notion of keeping the landlord 's rent in the pocket had been found to be surrounded with difficulties .::::the
But the great principle was there , and there had come another eloquent man , <<target>> had also been in America ; and Kit Mooney was now a confirmed Landleaguer .::::who
`` Faix thin , yer honour , it is n't much hunting the quality will see this day out <<target>> Moytubber ; nor yet nowhere round , av the boys are as good as their word . ''::::of
`` Why should they not <<target>> at Moytubber ? ''::::hunt
said Mr. Daly , who , as he looked around <<target>> indeed ample cause why there should be no hunting .::::saw
He had thought as he trotted along the road that some individual Landleaguer would hold his horse by the rein and cause him to stop him in the performance of his duty ; but <<target>> were two hundred footmen there roaming at will through the sacred precincts of the gorse , and Daly knew well that no fox could have remained there with such a crowd around him .::::there
`` The boys are just taking their pleasure themselves this fine Christmas morning , '' said <<target>> , who had not moved from the bank on which he had been found sitting .::::kit
`` Begorra , you 'll find 'em all out <<target>> the counthry , intirely , Mr. Daly .::::about
They 're out to <<target>> your honour welcome .::::make
There is lashings of 'em across in Phil French 's woods <<target>> all down to Peter Brown 's , away at Oranmore .::::and
There is not a boy in the barony but what <<target>> out to bid yer honour welcome this morning . ''::::is
Kit Mooney could not have given a more exact account of what was being done by `` the <<target>> '' on that morning had he owned all those rich gifts of eloquence which Mr. O'Meagher possessed .::::boys
Tom Daly at once saw that there was no <<target>> for shooting any culprit , and was thankful .::::need
The interruption to the sport of the county had become much more general than he had expected , and it was <<target>> so organised as to have spread itself over all that portion of County Galway , in which his hounds ran .::::apparently
Why ai n't the boys to <<target>> having their fun ? ''::::be
It was useless to allow a hound <<target>> go into the covert of Moytubber .::::to
The crowd around was waiting anxiously to see the attempt <<target>> , so that they might enjoy their triumph .::::made
To watch Black Tom drawing Moytubber without a fox would be nuts to them ; and then to follow the hounds on to <<target>> next covert , and to the next , with the same result , would afford them an ample day 's amusement .::::the
But the Bodkins , and the Blakes , and the Persses were <<target>> alive to this , and so also was Tom Daly .::::quite
A council of war was therefore held , in order that the line of conduct might be <<target>> which might be held to be most conducive to the general dignity of the hunt .::::adopted
`` I should send the hounds <<target>> , '' said Lord Ardrahan .::::home
`` If Mr. Daly would call at my place and lunch , <<target>> he goes by , I should be most happy . ''::::as
The shake was intended to signify that he did not <<target>> the advice tendered , nor the accompanying hospitable offer .::::like
To go home would be to throw down their <<target>> at once , and acknowledge themselves beaten .::::arms
If beaten to-day , why should they not be beaten on another <<target>> , and then what would become of Tom Daly 's employment ?::::day
A sad idea came across his mind , as he shook his head , warning him that in <<target>> terrible affair of to-day , he might see the end of all his life 's work .::::this
Such a thought had never <<target>> to him before .::::occurred
If a crowd of disloyal Roman Catholics chose to prevent the <<target>> in their hunting , undoubtedly they had the power .::::gentry
Daly was slow at thinking , but an idea when it <<target>> once come home to him , struck him forcibly .::::had
As he shook his head at that moment he bethought himself , what would become of <<target>> Daly if the people of the county refused to allow his hounds to run ?::::black
And a second idea struck him , -- that <<target>> certainly would not lunch with Lord Ardrahan .::::he
Lord Ardrahan was , to his thinking , somewhat pompous , and had been felt by Tom <<target>> expect that he , Tom , should acknowledge the inferiority of his position by his demeanour .::::to
Now such an idea as this was altogether <<target>> opposition to Tom 's mode of living .::::in
Even though the hounds were to be taken away from him , and he were left at Daly 's Bridge with the Â£200 a <<target>> which had come to him from his father , he would make no such acknowledgment as that to any gentleman in County Galway .::::year
So he shook his head , and said <<target>> a word in answer to Lord Ardrahan .::::not
`` What do you propose <<target>> do , Daly ? ''::::to
`` Go on and <<target>> till night .::::draw
There 's a moon , and if we can find a fox <<target>> ten , Barney and I will manage to kill him .::::before
Those blackguards ca n't keep <<target>> with us . ''::::on
This was Daly 's plan , spoken out <<target>> hearing of many of the blackguards .::::within
`` You had better take my offer , and <<target>> to Ardrahan Castle , '' said his lordship .::::come
`` No , my lord , '' said Daly , with the tone <<target>> authority which a master of hounds always knows how to assume .::::of
`` I shall <<target>> on .::::draw
Barney , get the <<target>> together . ''::::hounds
Then he whispered to Barney Smith that <<target>> hounds should go on to Kilcornan .::::the
Now Kilcornan was a place much beloved by <<target>> , about ten miles distant from Moytubber .::::foxes
It was not among the coverts appointed to be drawn <<target>> that day , which all lay back towards Ahaseragh .::::on
At Kilcornan the earths would <<target>> found to open .::::be
But it would be better to trot off rapidly to some distant home <<target>> foxes , even though the day 's sport might be lost .::::for
Daly was very anxious that it should not be said through the country that he <<target>> been driven home by a set of roughs from any one covert or another .::::had
But by going to Kilcornan he <<target>> throw them off his scent .::::might
So he started for Kilcornan , having whispered his orders to <<target>> Smith , but communicating his intentions to no one else .::::barney
`` What will you <<target>> , Daly ? ''::::do
`` But where will <<target>> go ? ''::::you
He had no cause for being crabbed <<target>> Sir Jasper as with Lord Ardrahan .::::with
But he did not want to <<target>> his purpose to any man .::::declare
There is no one in the ordinary work of <<target>> life so mysterious as a master of hounds .::::his
And among masters no one was <<target>> mysterious than Tom Daly .::::more
And this , too , <<target>> no ordinary day .::::was
Tom only shook his head <<target>> trotted on in advance .::::and
His secret had been told only to Barney Smith , and <<target>> Barney Smith he knew that it would be safe .::::with
So they all trotted off at <<target>> pace much faster than usual .::::a
`` What 's up with <<target>> Tom now ? ''::::black
asked Sir Nicholas <<target>> Sir Jasper .::::of
`` What 's Daly <<target>> to now ? ''::::up
asked Mr. Blake <<target>> Mr. Persse .::::of
They all shook their heads , and declared themselves <<target>> to follow their leader without further inquiry .::::willing
So they followed him ; and in half an hour 's <<target>> it became apparent that they were going to Kilcornan .::::time
But at Kilcornan they found a crowd almost equal <<target>> that which had stopped them at Moytubber .::::to
Kilcornan is a large demesne , into which they would , in <<target>> ordinary course , have made their entrance through the lodge gate .::::the
At present they went at once to an outlying covert , which was supposed to be especially the abode of foxes ; but even here , as <<target>> trotted up with his hounds , at a pace much quicker than usual , they found that the ground before them had been occupied by Landleaguers .::::barney
`` When we heard you were a-coming we <<target>> a little hunt of our own .::::had
There ai n't a fox anywhere about <<target>> place now , Muster Daly . ''::::the
What shall we <<target>> next ?::::do
It does not behove a master of hounds <<target>> seek counsel in difficulty from anyone .::::to
A man , if he is master , <<target>> be sufficient to himself in all emergencies .::::should
No man felt this more clearly <<target>> did Black Tom Daly .::::than
But now he must think the matter out <<target>> himself and follow his own devices .::::for
But , sitting there , he <<target>> make up his mind .::::did
He would go on to Mr. Lambert 's place at Clare , and would draw <<target>> coverts , going there as fast as the horse 's legs would carry him .::::the
Then he would draw back by impossible <<target>> , to the kennels at Ahaseragh .::::routes
Men might come with him or might go ; <<target>> to none would he tell his mind .::::but
If Providence would only send him a fox on the route , <<target>> things , he thought , might still be well with him .::::all
It would be odd if he and Barney Smith , between them , were not <<target>> to give an account of that fox when they had done with him .::::able
He spoke no word to anyone , but he <<target>> go on just as he proposed to himself .::::did
Before the day was over -- or rather , before the night was far advanced -- he <<target>> borrowed three others , in his course about the country , for himself and his servants .::::had
Quick as lightning he went from covert to covert ; but the conspiracy had been well <<target>> , and a holiday for the foxes in County Galway was established for that day .::::arranged
Some men were very stanch to him , going with him whither they knew not , so that `` poor dear Tom '' might <<target>> be left alone ; but alone he was during the long evening of that day , as far as all conversation went .::::not
He spoke to no one , except to Barney , and to him only a few words ; giving him <<target>> direction as to where he should go next , and into what covert he should put the hounds .::::a
They , too , must have been much surprised and very weary , as <<target>> dragged their tired limbs to their kennel , at about eight o'clock .::::they
And Tom Daly 's ride across the country will long be remembered , <<target>> the exertions which he made to find a fox on that day .::::and
But it was <<target>> in vain .::::all
The occupation of his life , <<target>> thought , was gone .::::he
These reprobates , whom he now hated worse than ever , having learned their powers to disturb <<target>> amusements of their betters , would never allow another day 's hunting in the county .::::the
He was aware now , though he never had thought of it before , <<target>> how weak a hold his right of hunting the country was held .::::by
He and his hounds could go into any covert ; but <<target>> also could any other man , with or without hounds .::::so
To disturb a fox , three or four men would suffice ; <<target>> would suffice according to Tom 's idea of a fox .::::one
The occupation of his <<target>> was over .::::life
Tom Daly was by <<target>> a melancholy man .::::nature
All County Galway <<target>> that .::::knew
He was a man not given to many words , <<target>> no means devoted to sport in the ordinary sense .::::by
It was a hard business <<target>> he had undertaken .::::that
The work was in every sense hard , <<target>> the payment made was very small .::::and
In fact no payment was made , other than that of his being lifted into a <<target>> in which he was able to hold his head high among gentlemen of property .::::position
He was an intent , eager man , whom it was hard to teach <<target>> the occupations of his life were less worthy than those of other men .::::that
But there had come moments of doubt as he had sat alone in his little room at Ahaseragh and <<target>> meditated , whether the pursuit of vermin was worthy all the energy which he had given to it .::::had
`` You may sell those brutes of yours now , and <<target>> perhaps you 'll be able to educate your children . ''::::then
Peter had asked , thinking more of the `` <<target>> '' alluded to than of the children .::::brutes
He was accustomed to the tone of his father 's remarks , and cared for them not <<target>> than the ordinary son cares for the expression of the ordinary father 's ill humour .::::more
But now he knew that some reference was intended to the interruption that had been made in <<target>> day 's sport , and was anxious to learn what his father thought about it .::::their
`` Because you wo n't want <<target>> for this game any longer .::::them
Hunting is done with <<target>> these parts .::::in
When a blackguard like Kit Mooney is able to address such a one as Tom <<target>> after that fashion , anything that requires respect may be said to be over .::::daly
Hunting has existed <<target>> on respect .::::solely
`` What does all that <<target>> , Lynch ? ''::::mean
`` It means quarrelling <<target>> the knife . ''::::to
`` In a quarrel to the knife , '' said Mr. <<target>> , `` all lighter things must be thrown away .::::persse
Daly had brought a pistol in his <<target>> as you heard this morning .::::pocket
I have been thinking of it ever since ; and , putting two and two together , <<target>> seems to me to be almost impossible that hunting should go on in County Galway . ''::::it
He had heard and seen what has been narrated , and was <<target>> much impressed as others with the condition of the country .::::as
The populace generally -- for so it had seemed to be -- had risen _en masse_ to put down the amusement of the gentry , <<target>> there had been a secret conspiracy , so that they had been able to do the same thing in different parts of the county .::::and
Frank , as he rode back to Morony Castle , a long way <<target>> Mr. Lambert 's covert , was very melancholy in his mind .::::from
The persecution of Mahomet M. Moss and of the <<target>> together was almost too much for him .::::landleaguers
When he got home his father also was <<target>> , and the girls were melancholy .::::melancholy
`` What sport have you <<target>> , Frank ? ''::::had
But he asked the question in a melancholy tone , simply <<target>> being one which the son expects on returning from hunting .::::as
In this expectation Mr. <<target>> gave way .::::jones
Frank shook his head , but <<target>> not utter a word .::::did
`` What do you <<target>> by that ? ''::::mean
`` The whole country <<target>> in arms . ''::::is
This , no doubt , was an exaggeration , as the only arms that had been <<target>> to Moytubber on the occasion had been the pistol in Tom Daly 's pocket .::::brought
I call men in arms , when they are prepared to carry out any illegal purpose <<target>> violence , and these men have done that all through the County Galway . ''::::by
`` What have <<target>> done ? ''::::they
`` You know where the meet was ; well , <<target>> drew Ballytowngal , and found no fox there .::::they
It was not expected , <<target>> nothing happened there .::::and
The people did not come into old Nick Bodkin 's demesne , but we had heard by <<target>> time that we were there that we should come across a lot of Landleaguers at Moytubber .::::the
There they were as thick as bees round the covert , and there was one man who had the impudence to tell <<target>> Daly that draw where he might , he would draw in vain for a fox to-day in County Galway . ''::::tom
`` Do you mean that <<target>> was a crowd ? ''::::there
Yes , all Claregalway seemed <<target>> have turned out .::::to
Claregalway is not much of a place , but everyone was there from <<target>> and from Athenry , and half the town from Galway city . ''::::oranmore
This certainly was an exaggeration on the part of Frank , but was excused <<target>> his desire to impress his father with the real truth in the matter .::::by
`` I never saw half such a <<target>> of people by a covert side .::::number
But the truth <<target>> soon known .::::was
They had beat Moytubber , and kicked up such a row <<target>> the foxes in that gorse had never heard before .::::as
And they were not slow <<target>> obtaining their object . ''::::in
`` Their object was <<target>> enough . ''::::clear
`` They did n't intend that the hounds should <<target>> that day either at Moytubber or elsewhere .::::hunt
Daly did not put his hounds into the covert at all ; but rode <<target>> as fast as his horse 's legs could carry him to Kilcornan . ''::::away
`` That must be ten miles at <<target>> , '' said his father .::::least
`` Twenty , <<target>> should think .::::i
This again was <<target>> exaggeration .::::an
`` But when we got to the covert at Kilcornan there was just the <<target>> sort of crowd , and just the same work had been on foot .::::same
The men there all told us that we <<target>> not expect to find a fox .::::need
A rumour had got about the field by this time <<target>> Tom Daly had a loaded pistol in his pocket .::::that

He could have done no good <<target>> a regular massacre . ''::::without
`` Did he show <<target>> pistol ? ''::::his
`` I did n't see it ; <<target>> I do believe it was there .::::but
Some of the old fogies were <<target>> solemn about it . ''::::awfully

asked Edith , who together with her sister <<target>> now listening to Frank 's narrative .::::was
`` You know Mr. Lambert 's <<target>> on the road towards Gort .::::place
But I went as far as that , <<target>> found a bigger crowd than ever .::::and
They said that all Gort was there ; but Tom having drawn the covert , went <<target>> , and swore that he would n't leave a place in all County Galway untried .::::on
He borrowed fresh horses , and went on <<target>> Barney Smith as grim as death .::::with
He is still drawing <<target>> covert somewhere . ''::::his
It was thus that Frank Jones told <<target>> story of that day 's hunting .::::the
To his father 's ears it <<target>> as being very ominous .::::sounded
He did not care much for hunting himself , nor would it much <<target>> him if the Landleaguers would confine themselves to this mode of operations .::::perplex
But as he heard of the crowds surrounding the coverts through the county , he thought also of his many <<target>> still under water , by the operation of a man who had taken upon himself to be his enemy .::::acres
And the whole morning had been spent in <<target>> endeavours to make Florian tell the truth .::::fruitless
But her father had said , that unless the truth were <<target>> told , he must allow the affair to go by .::::now
`` The time for dealing with the matter <<target>> be gone , '' he had said .::::will
`` Pat Carroll is going about the country as bold as brass , and says that he will fix his own <<target>> ; whereas I know , and all the tenants know , that he ought to be in Galway jail .::::rent

The people had not interfered there , <<target>> the day had been altogether propitious .::::and
Tom had for the moment been in high good humour ; but the interruption had come again , <<target>> had been so repeated as to make him feel that his occupation was in truth gone .::::and
The gentry of the county had then held a meeting at Ballinasloe , and <<target>> decided that the hounds should be withdrawn for the remainder of the season .::::had

It may almost be said that no word <<target>> been addressed by either to the other .::::had
No further kind of <<target>> had been inflicted .::::punishment
Indeed , the boy enjoyed a much wider liberty than had been <<target>> to him before , or than was good for him .::::given

He was charitable , with so little means for charity ; he was very eager in his discourses , in the course of which he would <<target>> to a dozen Protestants for three-quarters of an hour , and would confine himself to one subject , the iniquities of the Roman Catholic religion .::::preach
He had heard of Florian 's perversion , and had made <<target>> the topic on which he had declaimed for two Sundays .::::it

Florian , in truth , did see more of Pat Carroll than he should have done ; and , though it would be wrong to suppose that he took a part <<target>> his father , he no doubt discussed the questions which were of interest to Pat Carroll , in a manner that would have been very displeasing to his father .::::against
`` Faix , Mr. Flory , '' Pat would say to him , `` 'av you 're one of us , you 've got to be one of us ; you 've had a <<target>> of light , as Father Brosnan says , to see the errors of your way ; but you 've got to see the errors of your way on 'arth as well as above .::::glimmer

The boy now was <<target>> in tears .::::sobbing
He lacked the resolution to continue his lie , <<target>> did not dare to tell the truth .::::but
`` What will <<target>> do ? ''::::you
`` I will tell all that <<target>> know about it . ''::::i

`` Will you tell <<target>> , then ? ''::::papa
`` Papa is so <<target>> to me . ''::::hard
I will first tell Father Brosnan that I am going to do it ; <<target>> shall not then have told the lie absolutely to my priest . ''::::i
On this occasion Edith could do nothing further with him ; and , indeed , the nature of the <<target>> which she expected him to make was such that it should be made to some person beyond herself .::::confession
She could understand that it must be taken down in some form that would be presentable to a magistrate , and that evidence of <<target>> guilt of Pat Carroll and evidence as to the possible guilt of others must not be whispered simply into her own ears .::::the
But she had now brought him to such a condition <<target>> she did think that his story would be told .::::that
Frank had received three or four letters from Rachel O'Mahony , the purport of them all being to explain her troubles with <<target>> M. M. , as she called the man ; but still so as to prevent Frank from attempting to interfere personally .::::mahomet
`` No doubt the man is a brute , '' she had said , `` if a <<target>> lady , without ceasing to be ladylike , may so describe so elegant a gentleman .::::young
If not so , still he is a brute , because I <<target>> n't declare otherwise , even for the sake of being ladylike .::::ca

Then he wrote to her the sort <<target>> love-letter which the reader can understand .::::of
It was full of kisses and vows and <<target>> hopes but did not name a day .::::ecstatic
In fact Mr. Jones , in the middle of his troubles , was unable to promise an immediate union , <<target>> did not choose that his son should marry in order that he might be supported by a singing girl .::::and
But to this letter Frank added a request -- or rather a command -- <<target>> he should be allowed to come over at once and see Mr. Mahomet .::::that
It was no doubt true that his father was , for the minute , a little backward in the matter <<target>> his income ; but still he wanted to look after Mahomet , and he wanted to be kissed .::::of

Of course I do ; I am <<target>> at all coy of my favours .::::not
You ask Mahomet also as to what he <<target>> of the strength of my right arm .::::thinks
I examined his face so minutely when I had to fall into his arms on the stage , <<target>> there I saw the round mark of my fist , and the swelling all round it .::::and
And I thought to myself as I was singing my devotion <<target>> he should have it next time in his eye .::::that
But , Frank , mark my words : I wo n't <<target>> you here till you can come to marry me .::::have
Florian had almost , but had not <<target>> , told the entire truth .::::quite
He had declared that Pat Carroll had done `` mischief , '' but had <<target>> quite said of what nature was the mischief which Carroll had done .::::not
It was now March , and the <<target>> troubles were still going on .::::hunting
The whole gentry in County Galway had determined to take Black Tom <<target>> 's part , and to carry him on through the contest .::::daly
But the effect of taking Black Tom Daly 's part was to take <<target>> part against which the Land Leaguers were determined to enrol themselves .::::the
And of all men he was the most determined ; with <<target>> it was literally a question between God and Mammon .::::him
A man could <<target>> serve both .::::not
In the simplicity of his heart , he thought that the Landleaguers were children of Satan , and that <<target>> have any dealings with them , or the passage of any kindness , was in itself Satanic .::::to
He said very little , but he spent whole hours <<target>> thinking of the evil that they were doing .::::in
And among the evils was the unparalleled insolence which <<target>> displayed in entering coverts in County Galway .::::they
Now Frank Jones , who had not hitherto been very intimate with Tom , <<target>> taken up his part , and was fighting for him at this moment .::::had
Nevertheless the provocation to him to go to London was very great , and he had only <<target>> it off till the last coverts should be drawn on Saturday the 2nd of April .::::put
The hunt had determined to stop their proceedings earlier than usual ; but still there <<target>> to be one day in April , for the sake of honour and glory .::::was
But in the latter days of March there <<target>> a third letter from Rachel O'Mahony .::::came
Like the other letter it was cheerful , and high-spirited ; but still it seemed to speak of <<target>> dangers , which Frank , though he could not understand them , thought that he could perceive .::::impending
My present engagement is to go on till the end of July , with an understanding that I am <<target>> have twenty guineas a night , for any evening that I may be required to sing in August .::::to
This your highness will perceive is a very considerable increase , and at three nights a week might afford an income on which your highness <<target>> perhaps condescend to come and eat a potato , in the honour of `` ould '' Ireland , till better times should come .::::would
That would be the happy potato which would <<target>> the first bought for such a purpose !::::be
But you must see that I can not expect a continuance of <<target>> present engagement as the head of your royal highness ' seraglio .::::my
I should have to look for another Chancellor of <<target>> Exchequer , and should probably find him .::::the
Mr. Mahomet M. Moss would hardly endure me as being <<target>> of the properties belonging to your royal highness .::::part
And now I must tell <<target>> my own little news .::::you
Beelzebub has taken a worse devil to himself , so that I am <<target>> to be trodden down into the very middle of the pit .::::likely
I choose to tell you because I wo n't have you <<target>> that I have ever kept anything secret from you .::::think
If I describe the roars of Mrs. Beelzebub to you , and her red claws , and her forky tongue , and her fiery tail , it is not because I like her as a <<target>> of poetry , but because this special subject comes uppermost ; and you shall never say to me , why did n't you tell me when you were introduced to Beelzebub 's wife ?::::subject
and assert , as men are apt to do , that <<target>> would not have allowed me to make her acquaintance .::::you
Mrs. Beelzebub appears on the stage as belonging to Mahomet but how they have <<target>> it all up together among themselves , I do not quite know .::::mixed
I do not think that they 're in love with <<target>> another , because she is not jealous of me .::::one
Of Monsieur Socani , or Signor Socani , <<target>> Herr Socani , I never yet heard .::::or

Now you know all about it ; but as you shall value the first squeeze which you <<target>> get when you do come , do n't come till your coming has been properly settled .::::shall
But she certainly wrote with a purpose of making him <<target>> that she was subjected to very considerable annoyance .::::understand
She was still determined not to call upon him for assistance ; and <<target>> warned him that any assistance whatever would be out of his power .::::she
A lover on the scene , who could not declare his <<target>> of speedy marriage , would be worse than useless .::::purpose
All that she saw plainly , -- or at any rate declared that she <<target>> plainly , though she was altogether unable to explain it to Frank Jones .::::saw
Mrs. Beelzebub is certainly the <<target>> of the devils .::::queen
I remember when you read `` Paradise Lost '' to <<target>> at Morony Castle , which I thought very dull .::::us
Milton arranged the ranks in Pandemonium differently ; but there has been a <<target>> since that , and Mrs. Beelzebub has everything just as she pleases .::::revolution
She urges him , -- well , <<target>> to make love to me .::::just
What reason there is between them I do n't know , but I <<target>> sure she wants him to get me altogether into his hands .::::am
I 'm not sure but what <<target>> is Mahomet 's own wife .::::she
This is a horrid kettle of <<target>> , as you will see .::::fish
But I think I 'll turn <<target>> to be head cook yet .::::out
If God does not walk atop of the <<target>> what 's the use of running straight ?::::devils
But I am sure he will , and the <<target>> so because there is in truth no temptation .::::more
She told me the other day to my <<target>> , that I was a fool .::::face
`` I know I am , '' said <<target>> demurely , `` but why ? ''::::i
Then she came out <<target>> her demand .::::with
It was very simple , and did <<target>> in truth amount to much .::::not
Frank Jones , when he read this , crushed the paper up in his <<target>> and went upstairs to his bedroom , determined to pack up immediately .::::hand
But before he had progressed far , he <<target>> out the letter and read the remainder .::::got
`` I am his particular friend , '' she said , with that peculiar New York aping of a <<target>> accent , which is the language that was , I am sure , generally used by the devils .::::foreign
Tell him I can hit much harder than that ; tell him <<target>> he will never find me unprepared , for a moment . ''::::that
Now I have got another little <<target>> of news for you .::::bit
Somebody has found out in New <<target>> that I am making money .::::york
It is true , <<target>> a limited way .::::in
Â£100 a month is something , and so they 've asked papa to subscribe as <<target>> as he can to a grand Home-Rule , anti-Protestant , hate-the-English , stars-and-stripes society .::::largely
It is the most loyal and beneficent thing out , and dear papa thinks I <<target>> do nothing better with my wealth than bestow it upon these birds of freedom .::::can
I have given them Â£200 , and am , <<target>> , at this moment , nearly impecunious .::::therefore
You will tell me that after the mild suggestion made by Mrs. Beelzebub , I <<target>> to walk out of the house , and go back to County Galway immediately .::::ought
I do n't <<target>> so .::::think
I am learning every day how best <<target>> stand fast on my own feet .::::to
I am earning my money honestly , and men and women <<target>> in London are saying that in truth I can sing .::::here
A very nice old gentleman called on me the other day from Covent Garden , and , making <<target>> two low bows , asked whether I was my own mistress some time in October next .::::me
I thought at the moment that I was at any rate free from the <<target>> engagement proposed by Mrs. Beelzebub , and told him that I was free .::::further
Then he made me two lower bows , touched the tip of my fingers , and said <<target>> he would be proud to wait upon me in a few days with a definite proposal .::::that
This old gentleman may mean twenty guineas a night for the <<target>> of next winter , or something like Â£250 a month .::::whole
But how am I to go on in my present impecunious <<target>> if I quarrel altogether with my bread and butter ?::::position
So now you know <<target>> about it .::::all
Remember that I have told my father <<target>> as to Mrs. Beelzebub 's proposition .::::nothing
It is better not ; he would disown it , <<target>> would declare that I had invented it from vanity .::::and
I do think that a woman in this country can <<target>> after herself if she be minded so to do .::::look
I do believe that he will pay me his money , as <<target>> has always done , and I want to earn my money .::::he
I have some little precautions -- <<target>> for a rainy day .::::just
I have told you everything -- everything , <<target>> you are to be my husband .::::because
Now , good-bye , <<target>> God bless you .::::and
Tell everybody that I 'm to <<target>> Mrs. Jones some day .::::be
Frank finished packing up , and then told his father that he was going off <<target>> Athenry at once , there to meet the night mail train up to Dublin .::::to
Frank then remembered that he could not <<target>> openly the story of Mrs. Beelzebub .::::tell
Rachel had told him in pure simple-minded confidence , and though he <<target>> prepared to disobey her , he would not betray her .::::was
`` She is on the <<target>> , '' he said .::::stage
`` I am aware of it , '' replied his father , intending to <<target>> that his son 's betrothed was not employed as he would have wished .::::signify
`` At the Charing Cross Opera , '' said the <<target>> , endeavouring to make the best of it .::::son
`` She is earning <<target>> bread honestly . ''::::her
`` I believe so , '' said Mr. Jones , `` I do believe <<target>> , I do think that Rachel O'Mahony is a thoroughly good girl . ''::::so
`` I am sure of it , '' said <<target>> and Edith almost in the same breath .::::ada
`` But not less on that account <<target>> the profession distasteful to me .::::is
You do not wish to see <<target>> sisters on the stage ? ''::::your
`` I have thought of all that , sir , '' said Frank , `` I have <<target>> made up my mind to make Rachel my wife , if it be possible . ''::::quite
`` Do you mean to live on what <<target>> may earn as an actress ? ''::::she
Here Frank remained silent <<target>> a moment .::::for
`` Because if you do , I must tell you that it <<target>> not become you as a gentleman to accept her income . ''::::will
`` You can not give us an <<target>> on which we may live . ''::::income
`` Certainly not <<target>> this moment .::::at

`` At this moment I <<target>> go to her . ''::::must
`` You have given no <<target>> for your going . ''::::reason
Frank thought of it , and told himself <<target>> there was in truth no reason .::::that
His going would be a trouble to Rachel , and yet <<target>> were reasons which made it imperative for him to go .::::there
`` Have you asked yourself what <<target>> be the expense ? ''::::will
`` It may cost I suppose twelve <<target>> , going and coming . ''::::pounds
`` And have you asked yourself how many twelve pounds will <<target>> likely to fall into your hands just at present ?::::be
Is she in <<target>> trouble ? ''::::any
`` I had rather not talk about <<target>> affairs , '' said Frank .::::her
`` Is not her <<target>> with her ? ''::::father
`` I do not think he is the best man in <<target>> world to help a girl in such an emergency . ''::::the
But he had not described <<target>> was the emergency .::::what
`` I do , '' said Frank , <<target>> up and walking out of the room .::::getting
At any rate , during that night and the <<target>> day he made his way up to London .::::following
At this period of our story much had already been said <<target>> the outside world as to flooding the meadows of Ballintubber .::::in
Like other outrages of the same kind , it had not at first been noticed otherwise than in the immediate neighbourhood ; and though a terrible injury had been inflicted , equal in value to <<target>> loss of five or six hundred pounds , it had seemed as though it would pass away unnoticed , simply because Mr. Jones had lacked evidence to bring it home to any guilty party .::::the
The days of the no-rent manifestation had not yet come , as the obnoxious Members of Parliament were not yet in prison ; but no-rent was already firmly <<target>> in the minds of many men , about to lead in the process of time to `` Arrears Bills , '' and other abominations of injustice .::::fixed
And among those conspicuous in the West , who were ready <<target>> seize fortune by the forelock , was Mr. Pat Carroll .::::to
In this way his name had come forward , and <<target>> were made of Mr. Jones which distressed him much .::::inquiries
For though he was ready to sacrifice his meadows , and his tenant , and his rent , he was most unwilling <<target>> do it if he should be called upon at the same time to sacrifice his boy 's character for loyalty .::::to
This was one Captain Yorke Clayton , who for <<target>> twelve months had been in the County Mayo .::::nearly
It was supposed that he had first shown himself there as a <<target>> officer , and had then very suddenly been appointed resident magistrate .::::constabulary
Why he was <<target>> nobody knew .::::captain
It was the fact , indeed , that he had been employed as adjutant in a volunteer <<target>> in England , having gone over there from the police force in the north of Ireland .::::regiment
His title had gone with him by no fault or no virtue of his own , and he had blossomed <<target>> to the world of Connaught as Captain Clayton before he knew why he was about to become famous .::::forth
Famous , however , <<target>> did become .::::he
They were recklessness of life <<target>> devotion to an idea .::::and
If Fortune do not help , recklessness of life amidst such dangers as those which surrounded Captain Clayton <<target>> soon bring a man to his end , so that there will be no question of fame .::::will
But we see men occasionally who seem <<target>> find it impossible to encounter death .::::to
It is not at all probable <<target>> this man wished to die .::::that
Life seemed to him to be pleasant enough : he was no forlorn lover ; he had fairly good health and strength ; people said of him that <<target>> had small but comfortable private means ; he was remarkable among all men for his good looks ; and he lacked nothing necessary to make life happy .::::he
But he appeared to be always <<target>> a hurry to leave it .::::in
A hundred men in Mayo had <<target>> that he should die .::::sworn
This was told to him very freely ; but he had only laughed at it , and <<target>> generally called `` the woodcock , '' as he rode about among his daily employments .::::was
Then there was his <<target>> to an idea !::::devotion
I will not call it loyalty , lest I should seem to praise the man <<target>> vehemently for that which probably was simply an instinct in his own heart .::::too
He lived upon his <<target>> of a Landleaguer .::::hatred
It was probably some conviction on his own part that the original <<target>> had come from New York , which produced this feeling .::::landleaguer
And it must be acknowledged of him with reference to the lower order of <<target>> that he did admit in his mind a possibility that they were curable .::::landleaguers
There were to him Landleaguers and Landleaguers ; but the Landleaguer whom Captain <<target>> Clayton hated with the bitterest prejudice was the Landleaguing Member of Parliament .::::yorke
Some of his worst enemies believed that he might be detected in breaking out into illegal expressions of hatred , or , <<target>> unfortunately still , into illegal acts , and that so the Government might be compelled to dismiss him with disgrace .::::more
Others , his warmest friends , hoped that by <<target>> a process his life might be eventually saved .::::such
To him also had Pat Carroll become intimately known , and <<target>> him the floods of Ballintubber were a peculiar case .::::to
It was one great desire of his heart to <<target>> Pat Carroll incarcerated as a penal felon .::::have
He did not very often express himself on this subject , <<target>> Pat Carroll knew well the nature of his wishes .::::but
`` A thundering bloody rapparee '' was the <<target>> by which Carroll delighted to call him .::::name
But Carroll was one who exercised none of that control over his <<target>> tongue for which Captain Clayton was said to be so conspicuous .::::own
During the last month Mr. Jones had seen Captain Clayton more than once at Galway , and on one occasion he had come down to Morony Castle <<target>> by a man who was supposed to travel as his servant , but who was known by all the world to be a policeman in disguise .::::attended
For Captain Clayton had been strictly forbidden by the authorities of the Castle to travel without such a <<target>> ; and an attempt had already been made to have him dismissed for disobedience to these orders .::::companion
Captain Clayton , when he had been at Morony Castle , had <<target>> Flory with great kindness , declining to cross-question him at all .::::treated
`` I would endeavour to save him from these <<target>> , '' he had said to his father .::::gentlemen
`` I do n't quite think that we understand what is going on within his mind ; '' <<target>> this had been before the conversation last mentioned which had taken place between Flory and his sisters .::::but
Now he was to come again , and make further <<target>> , and meet half-a-dozen policemen from the neighbourhood .::::inquiry
But Florian had as yet but half confessed , and almost <<target>> that Captain Clayton would appear among them as his friend .::::hoped
The girls , to tell the truth , had been <<target>> taken with the appearance of the gallant Captain .::::much
It seems to be almost a shame to tell the truth of what <<target>> girls may think of any man whom they may chance to meet .::::modest
They would never tell <<target>> to themselves .::::it
Even two sisters can <<target>> do so .::::hardly
And when the man comes before them , just for once or twice , to be judged and thought of at <<target>> single interview , the girl , -- such as were these girls , -- can hardly tell it to herself .::::a
`` He is manly and brave , and has so much to say for himself , and is so good-looking , <<target>> what can any girl who has her heart at her own disposal wish for better than such a lover ? ''::::that
It would have been quite impossible that either of Mr. <<target>> 's daughters could ever have so whispered to herself .::::jones
But was it not natural that such an unwhispered thought should have passed through the mind of Ada -- Ada <<target>> beautiful , Ada the sentimental , Ada the young lady who certainly was in want of a lover ?::::the
`` But what is the good of a man <<target>> nice when he is a 'woodcock ' ? ''::::being
`` Everybody says that his <<target>> is before him .::::destiny

`` I do , and I mean to say that if I were a <<target>> , it might be that I should have to be killed too .::::man
A man has to run his chance , and if he falls into such <<target>> position as this , of course he must put up with it .::::a
`` Why does he not go away <<target>> leave the horrid country ? ''::::and
`` Because the more brave men that go <<target>> the more horrid the country will become .::::away
And then I think a man is always the <<target>> if he has something really to think of .::::happier
Such a one as Captain Clayton does <<target>> want to go to balls . ''::::not
`` I suppose not , '' said Ada plaintively , as though she thought <<target>> a thousand pities that Captain Clayton should not want to go to balls .::::it
`` Such a man , '' said Edith with an air of firmness , `` finds a woman <<target>> he wants to marry , who will suit him , -- and then he marries her .::::when

`` The possible young woman must <<target>> left to judge of that .::::be
I do think it well that there <<target>> be such men as Captain Clayton .::::should

But I am sure I should feel that I ought n't <<target>> ask a girl to share the world with me .::::to

It is part of the horror of his business that he should n't <<target>> venture to dance , lest some poor female should be captivated . ''::::even
`` A girl might be captivated <<target>> dancing , '' said Ada .::::without
`` I do n't mean to say that such a man should absolutely tie himself up in a bag <<target>> that no poor female should run any possible danger , but he ought n't to encourage such risks .::::so
Was it proper that such a man as Captain Yorke Clayton should abstain from falling in love with a girl , <<target>> even from allowing a girl to fall in love with him because he was in danger of being shot ?::::or
It was certainly <<target>> difficult question .::::a
Was any man to be debarred from the pleasures , and incidents , and natural excitements of a <<target>> 's life because of the possible dangers which might possibly happen to a possible young woman ?::::man
Looking at the matter all round , Ada did not see that the man could help himself unless he were to be shut <<target>> in a bag , as Edith had said , so as to prevent a young woman from falling in love with him .::::up
Although he were a `` woodcock , '' the <<target>> must go on in its own natural course .::::thing
If misfortunes did come , <<target>> misfortunes must come .::::why
It was the same thing with <<target>> soldier or any sailor .::::any
If she were to fall in love with some officer , -- for the supposition in its vague , undefined form was admissible even to poor <<target>> 's imagination , -- she would not be debarred from marrying him merely by the fact that he would have to go to the wars .::::ada
Of course , as regarded Captain Yorke <<target>> , this was merely a speculation .::::clayton
He reached the pier at about four o'clock , accompanied by his faithful follower , and <<target>> there met by Mr. Jones himself , who walked up with him to the Castle .::::was
There was a short cut across the fields to Mr. Jones 's house ; and as they left the road about a <<target>> up from the pier , they were surrounded by the waters which Mr. Carroll had let in upon the Ballintubber meadows .::::furlong

`` I have a couple myself , '' said Mr. Jones , indicating their whereabouts , and showing that he was <<target>> as yet so used to carry them , as to have provided himself with a belt for the purpose .::::not

Edith was to go down and <<target>> herself before Captain Yorke Clayton .::::present

Edith , how can you think <<target>> such a thing ? ''::::of
`` It would be very unpleasant if some assassin were to <<target>> my back hair for Captain Clayton 's brown head .::::take
They 're very nearly <<target>> same colour . ''::::the
`` Wo n't you go first <<target>> brush your hair ? ''::::and
said Ada ; `` and do put <<target>> ribbon on your neck . ''::::a
`` I 'll do <<target>> of the kind .::::nothing
It would be a sheer manoeuvring to entrap a man <<target>> ought to be safeguarded against all such female wiles .::::who
Besides , I do n't believe a bit that Captain Clayton would <<target>> the difference between a young lady with or without a ribbon .::::know
So saying , Edith descended <<target>> her father 's room .::::to
She found Florian with his hand upon the <<target>> , and they both entered the room .::::door
I have said that Captain Clayton was a remarkably good-looking man , and I ought , perhaps , to give some explanation of the term when first introducing him to the reader in the presence of a lady who is intended to become the <<target>> of this story ; but it must suffice that I have declared him to be good-looking , and that I add to that the fact that though he was thirty-five years old , he did not look to be more than five-and-twenty .::::heroine
The two peculiarities of his face were very <<target>> blue eyes , and very long moustachios .::::light
`` Florian and I have come to see the latter-day hero , '' said Edith laughing as she entered the room ; `` <<target>> I know that you are so done up with pistols that no peaceable young woman ought to come near you . ''::::though
To this he made some sportive reply , and then before a minute <<target>> passed over their heads he had taken Florian by the hand .::::had
`` There 's nothing particularly the matter <<target>> me , '' said Florian .::::with
`` I suppose all this <<target>> troubling you ? ''::::is
You mean about <<target>> Carroll .::::pat
Nobody will believe a word <<target>> I say . ''::::that
`` But they do believe you now that you <<target>> telling the truth , '' said Edith .::::are
`` Do you hold your tongue , miss , '' said the boy , `` <<target>> do n't see why you should have so much to say about it . ''::::i
`` She has been your best friend from <<target>> to last , '' said the father .::::first
`` If it had not been for Edith I <<target>> have turned you out of the house .::::would

Then there was a long pause , during which the <<target>> kept his eyes fixed on the boy 's face .::::captain
And Edith had moved round so as to seat herself close <<target>> her brother , and had taken his hand in hers .::::to

`` But so mistaken , '' said the Captain , `` because he can refuse to answer us who are treating him with such tenderness and affection , who did not even want to wound his feelings more than <<target>> can help , he thinks that he can hold his peace in the same fashion , before the entire court ; and that he can do so , although he has owned that he knows the men .

`` A lie can never be as good as the truth , whether from a boy <<target>> a girl , '' said the Captain , endeavouring to look him through and through .::::or
The boy quavered beneath his gaze , and <<target>> Captain went on with his questioning .::::the
`` I suppose we may take it for granted that Pat <<target>> was there , and that you did see him ? ''::::carroll
`` You may take <<target>> for granted . ''::::anything
`` You would have to swear before a <<target>> that Pat Carroll was there . ''::::jury
Then there was another pause , but at last , <<target>> a long sigh , the boy spoke out .::::with
`` He was there , and <<target>> did see him . ''::::i
Then he burst into tears and threw himself down on the <<target>> , and hid his face in his sister 's lap .::::ground
I knew that you would struggle to <<target>> a gentleman at last . ''::::be
`` It will all come right with <<target>> now , '' said the Captain .::::him
But the father frowned <<target>> shook his head .::::and
`` How many were <<target>> with him ? ''::::there
asked the Captain , intent <<target>> the main business .::::on
But Florian feeling that it would be as good to be hung for a sheep as a lamb , and feeling also that he had at last cast aside all the bonds which bound him to Pat Carroll and Father Brosnan , -- <<target>> that there was nothing left for him but the internecine enmity of his old friends , -- got up from the floor , and wiping away the tears from his face , spoke out boldly the whole truth as he knew it .::::feeling
`` It was dark , and <<target>> did n't see them all .::::i
There were only six whom I could see , though I know that there were many others round <<target>> among the meadows whose names I had heard , though I do not remember them . ''::::about
`` We will confine ourselves to the six whom you did see , '' <<target>> the Captain , preparing to listen quietly to the boy 's story .::::said
Edith again got hold of the boy 's hand , and <<target>> it within her own till his story was finished .::::held
`` I did n't see <<target>> six all at once .::::the
They were up there just where the lane <<target>> turned down from the steamboat road .::::has
I had gone down to the big sluice gates before anyone had noticed me , and there were Tim and Terry smashing away <<target>> the gate hinges , up to their middles in mud ; and Pat Carroll was handing them down a big crowbar .::::at
Terry , when he saw me , fell flat forward into <<target>> water , and had to be picked out again . ''::::the
`` Did they say anything <<target>> threaten you ? ''::::to
`` Tim Brady said that I was all right , <<target>> was a great friend of Father Brosnan 's .::::and
Then they whispered together , and I heard Terry say that <<target>> would n't go against anything that Father Brosnan might say .::::he

`` Did he <<target>> you ? ''::::threaten
`` He did n't do it in a threatening way ; but <<target>> asked me to be hand and glove with them . ''::::only
`` Had you been intimate <<target>> this man before ?::::with
`` He had been very intimate with <<target>> , '' said the father .::::him
`` All this calamity has <<target>> of his intimacy .::::come
He has changed his religion and <<target>> to be a gentleman . ''::::ceased
Here the boy again sobbed , <<target>> Edith still squeezed his hand .::::but
`` What did <<target>> say ? ''::::you
asked the Captain , `` when he bade <<target>> be hand and glove with him ? ''::::you
Then they made the sign of a <<target>> , and swore me on it .::::cross
And they swore me specially <<target>> say nothing up here .::::to
And they swore me again when they met <<target>> at Tim Rafferty 's house in Headford .::::down
I intended to keep my word , and I think <<target>> you ought to have let me keep it . ''::::that
`` But there were three others whom <<target>> saw , '' urged the Captain .::::you
`` There was Con Heffernan , and a man they call <<target>> , who had come from Lough Conn beyond Castlebar . ''::::lax
`` He 's not a <<target>> of this county . ''::::man
`` I think not , though <<target>> had seen him here before .::::i
He has had something to do with <<target>> Landleaguers up about Foxford . ''::::the
`` I think I have a speaking acquaintance with that Mr. Lax , '' said the Captain ; <<target>> everybody could perceive that the tone of his voice was altered as he spoke about Mr. Lax .::::and
`` And who was <<target>> sixth ? ''::::the
`` There was that old man , <<target>> , whom they call Terry .::::papa
But he was n't doing <<target>> in particular . ''::::anything
`` He is the greatest blackguard on <<target>> estate , '' said the father .::::the
What was Mr. <<target>> doing ? ''::::lax
`` I ca n't remember <<target>> they were all doing .::::what
How is a fellow <<target>> remember them all ?::::to
There were those two at the hinges , and Pat Carroll <<target>> there pulling his brother out of the water . ''::::was
`` And then they went on , and <<target>> no notice of me for a time .::::took
Lax came up and scowled at me , and told me that if a <<target>> was said I should never draw the breath of life again . ''::::word
How is a fellow to remember <<target>> so many months ? ''::::after
`` Why did n't you tell <<target>> truth at the time ? ''::::the
Another tear stood in each of the poor boy 's eyes , and Edith <<target>> closer to him , and threw her left arm round his waist .::::got
`` You are spoiling him by being so <<target>> with him , '' said the father .::::soft
`` Do n't be <<target>> with him now .::::harsh
Well , Florian , <<target>> came next ? ''::::what
`` They bade me go away , <<target>> again made me swear another oath .::::and
It was nearly dark then , and it was quite <<target>> night before I got up to the house .::::dark
But before I went I saw that there were <<target>> others standing idle about the place . ''::::many
`` Do you remember <<target>> particularly ? ''::::any
`` Well , there was another of the Carrolls , a nephew of <<target>> 's ; and there was Tony Brady , Tim 's brother .::::pat

Three or four men will often contradict each <<target>> , and then they will break down .::::other

I have not taken down a <<target>> that you have said .::::word

Pat Carroll has had nothing to get <<target>> flooding your father 's meadows .::::by
But because your father has not chosen to forgive him his rent , <<target>> has thought fit to do him all the injury in his power .::::he
I fear that there are others in it , <<target>> are more to blame even than Pat Carroll .::::who
But if we can get hold of this gentleman , and also <<target>> his friend Mr. Lax , we shall have done much . ''::::of
Then the meeting was over for that evening , <<target>> Captain Clayton retired to his own room .::::and
`` You need n't mind following me here , <<target>> , '' he said to the policeman .::::hunter
`` I would n't be <<target>> sure , sir . ''::::too
`` You may be sure <<target>> Mr. Jones 's house .::::in
And no one in the country has any <<target>> of committing murder on his own behalf .::::idea
I am safe till they would have had time <<target>> send for someone out of another county .::::to
But we shall be back <<target>> Galway to-morrow . ''::::in
So saying , Hunter left his master alone , and the Captain sat <<target>> to write an account of the scene which had just taken place .::::down
In this he gave every name as the boy had given it , with accuracy ; but , <<target>> , he added to his little story the fact that it had been related from memory .::::nevertheless
Edith took her brother away into her own <<target>> , and there covered him with kisses .::::room
`` Why is papa so <<target>> to me ? ''::::hard
Then she explained to him as gently as she could , the <<target>> which had existed for hardness on his father 's part .::::grounds
She bade him consider how terrible a thing it must be to a father , to have to think <<target>> his own son should have turned against him , while the country was in such a condition .::::that
`` It is not the flood , Flory , <<target>> the loss of the meadows being under water .::::nor
It is not the injury that Pat Carroll has done him , <<target>> any of the men whom Pat Carroll has talked into enmity .::::or
That , indeed , <<target>> very dreadful .::::is
To these very men he has been <<target>> best friend for many years .::::their
And now they would help in his ruin , and turn us and him out as beggars upon <<target>> world , because he has not chosen to obey the unjust bidding of one of them . ''::::the
`` But it <<target>> not that .::::is
All that has had no effect <<target>> nigh breaking his heart .::::in
No one can bear its <<target>> better than our papa .::::loss
Though he might have to starve , he would starve like <<target>> gallant man ; and we could starve with him .::::a
You and I , Frank and Ada , <<target>> bear all that he could bear .::::would
But -- '' The boy looked up into her face again , as though <<target>> her to spare him , but she went on with her speech .::::imploring
`` But that a son of his should cease to feel <<target>> a gentleman should feel , -- and a Christian !::::as
It is that which moves him to <<target>> hard , as you call it .::::be
It is never too late while you feel <<target>> duty calls you to do . ''::::what
And again she covered him with kisses , and then <<target>> him to go away to his own room .::::allowed
When Edith was alone she sat back in an easy-chair , with her feet on the fender <<target>> the turf fire , and began to consider how things might go with her poor brother .::::before
`` If they should get hold of <<target>> , and murder him ! ''::::him
The thought was very dreadful , but she comforted herself with reflecting that he might be sent <<target>> of the country , before the knowledge of what he had done should get abroad .::::out
And then by means of that current of thought , which always runs where it listeth , <<target>> of the will of the thinker , her ideas flew off to Captain Yorke Clayton .::::independent
In her imagination she had put down Captain <<target>> as a possible lover for her sister .::::clayton
She possessed a girlish intuition into her sister 's mind which made <<target>> feel that her sister would not dislike such an arrangement .::::her
Ada was the beauty of the family , and was supposed , at any <<target>> by Edith , to be the most susceptible of the two sisters .::::rate
But no one had ever heard Ada <<target>> of herself as an old maid .::::speak
And then as to that danger of which Ada had spoken , Edith <<target>> that such perils must be overlooked altogether among the incidents of life .::::knew
If it came to her would she refuse her hand to <<target>> man because his courage led him into special perils ?::::a
She knew that it would only be <<target>> additional ground for her love .::::an
And of Ada , in that respect , <<target>> judged as she did of herself .::::she
She knew that Ada thought much of manly beauty , and <<target>> eyes told her that Captain Yorke Clayton was very handsome .::::her
`` If he were as black as Beelzebub , '' she said to herself , `` I should <<target>> him the better for it ; but Ada would prefer a man to be beautiful . ''::::like
She went to work to make a match in her own mind between Ada and Captain Clayton ; but the more she made it , the more <<target>> continued to think -- on her own behalf -- that of all men she had ever seen , this man had pleased her fancy most .::::she
`` But Captain Yorke Clayton , you were never more mistaken in all your life <<target>> you think that Edith Jones has taken a fancy to your handsome physiognomy . ''::::if
This she said in <<target>> audible words .::::almost
`` But nevertheless , I do <<target>> that you are a hero .::::think
For myself , I do n't want a hero -- and <<target>> I did , I should n't get one . ''::::if
But the arrangements made in the house that night were those which are customary for a favoured <<target>> man 's reception when such matters are left to the favouring young lady in the family .::::young
When Mr. Jones found himself alone in his study , he <<target>> to think of the confession which Florian had made .::::began
It had gradually come to pass that he had been sure of the truth for some <<target>> , though he had never before heard it declared by his son 's lips .::::months
Since the day on which he had called on Mr. Blake at <<target>> , he had been quite sure that Edith was right .::::carnlough
He was almost <<target>> before .::::sure
Now the truth was declared exactly <<target>> she had surmised it .::::as
And what should he <<target>> with the boy ?::::do
He could not merely put him forward <<target>> a witness in this case .::::as
Some reason must be given , why the truth <<target>> not been told during the last six months .::::had
As he thought of this , he felt <<target>> the boy had disgraced himself for ever .::::that
And he thought of <<target>> boy 's danger .::::the
He had rashly promised that the boy should be sent to England out of harm 's way ; but he now told himself that the <<target>> of doing so were further from him than ever ; and that he was daily becoming a poorer , if not a ruined man .::::means
Of the rents then due to him , not <<target>> penny would , he feared , be paid .::::a

Rachel O'Mahony found her position <<target>> be very embarrassing .::::to
She had thought it out to the best of her ability , and had told herself <<target>> it would be better for her not to acquaint her father with all the circumstances .::::that
Had he been told the nature of the offer made to her by Madame Socani , <<target>> would at once , she thought , have taken her away from the theatre .::::he
She would have to abandon the theatre , <<target>> which she was earning her money .::::at
This would have <<target>> very bad .::::been
There would have been some lawsuit with Mahomet Moss , as to which <<target>> could not have defended herself by putting Madame Socani into the witness-box .::::she
There had been no third person present , and any possible <<target>> of lying would have been very easy to Madame Socani .::::amount
Rachel was quick enough , and could see at <<target>> moment all that lying could do against her .::::a
Then she could see how , with a shrug of <<target>> shoulders , her enemy would have ruined her .::::his
From such a contest a man like Moss comes <<target>> without even a scratch that can injure him .::::forth
But Rachel felt that she <<target>> have been utterly annihilated .::::would
She must tell someone , but that someone <<target>> be he whom she intended to marry .::::must
And she , too , had not been quite prudent <<target>> all respects since she had come to London .::::in
It had been whispered to her that a singer of such pretensions should <<target>> brought to the theatre and carried home in her private brougham .::::be
Therefore , she had spent more money than was compatible with the <<target>> given to her father , and was something in debt .::::assistance
It was indispensable to her that she <<target>> go on with her engagement .::::should
But she told her father that it was absolutely necessary that he <<target>> go with her to the theatre every night that she sang .::::should
It was but three nights a week , and the <<target>> of her work were only from eight till ten .::::hours
He had , however , unfortunately <<target>> another engagement for himself .::::made
There was a debating society , dramatic in its manner of carrying on its business , at which three or four Irish Home-Rulers <<target>> accustomed to argue among themselves , before a mixed audience of Englishmen and Irishmen , as to the futility of English government .::::were
Not many knew that the eloquent Irishman was the father of the singer <<target>> , in truth , was achieving for herself a grand reputation .::::who
But such was <<target>> case .::::the
A stop had been put upon his lecturings at Galway ; but no policeman in London seemed <<target>> be aware that the Galway incendiary and the London debater were one and the same person .::::to
So there came to him an opening for picking <<target>> a few pounds towards their joint expenses .::::up
he said , contending for the <<target>> of his own time .::::use
`` Mr. Moss <<target>> disagreeable . ''::::is
`` Has he done <<target>> new ? ''::::anything

`` No ; I have got <<target>> that , thank Heaven !::::through

`` Of course I will do what you want , '' said <<target>> father ; `` but only if it be not necessary -- ''::::her
Of course , I do not wish to be dragged up <<target>> the police-court for sticking Mr. Moss in the abdomen .::::to

`` If they know , or if he knows that you 're <<target>> the house , there will be nothing of the kind .::::in
Ca n't you arrange your debates <<target>> the other nights ? ''::::for
So it was , <<target>> fact , settled .::::in
Everybody about the theatre seemed to <<target>> aware that something was wrong .::::be
Mr. O'Mahony had not come back to be constantly on the <<target>> , like a Newfoundland dog , without an object .::::watch
To himself it was <<target>> intolerable nuisance .::::an
He suspected his daughter <<target>> at all .::::not
He was so far from suspecting her that he imagined her <<target>> be safe , though half-a-dozen Mosses should surround her .::::to
But still he did it , <<target>> asked no further questions .::::and
Then while all this was going on , the polite old gentleman from Covent Garden had called <<target>> her lodgings in Cecil Street , and had found both her and her father at home .::::at
`` Oh , M. Le Gros , '' she had said , `` <<target>> am so glad that you should meet my father here . ''::::i
Then there was a multiplicity of bowing , and M. Le Gros had declared that he had never had so much honour done <<target>> as in being introduced to him who was about to become the father of the undoubted prima donna of the day .::::him
At all which Mr. O'Mahony made many bows , and Rachel laughed very heartily ; but in the <<target>> an engagement was proposed and thankfully accepted , which was to commence in the next October .::::end
It did not take two <<target>> in the making .::::minutes
It was an engagement only for a couple of months ; but , as M. <<target>> Gros observed , such an engagement would undoubtedly lead to one for all time .::::le
M. Le Gros had quite felt the dishonesty <<target>> even suggesting a longer engagement to mademoiselle .::::of
The rate of payment would be very much higher , ve-ry , ve-ry , ve-ry much higher <<target>> mademoiselle 's voice should have once been heard on the boards of a true operatic theatre .::::when
M. Le Gros had done himself the honour of being present <<target>> one or two occasions at the Charing Cross little playhouse .::::on
He did believe himself to have some <<target>> critical judgment in musical matters .::::small
He thought he might venture -- he really did think that <<target>> might venture -- to bespeak a brilliant career for mademoiselle .::::he
Then , with a great many more bowings and scrapings , M. <<target>> Gros , having done his business , took his leave .::::le
`` One has all <<target>> courtesy of hell !::::the
I can imagine something brighter even than M. Le <<target>> ; but it does very well for earth .::::gros
M. Le Gros knows that a young woman should be treated as a human being ; and <<target>> his blandishments are pleasant enough , as they are to take the shape of golden guineas .::::even
As for me , M. Le Gros is quite <<target>> enough for my idea of this world . ''::::good
It was not singing night , and Mr. O'Mahony had just taken up his <<target>> to go away to his debating society , when Frank Jones was announced .::::hat
`` Frank , what on earth <<target>> you come here for ? ''::::did

He remained for awhile meditating on his position , till he began <<target>> think that it would be useless for him to remain there .::::to
She certainly would not come down ; and he , though he were to wait <<target>> her father 's return , would get no more favourable reply from him .::::for
He , as he had promised , would certainly `` back <<target>> '' his daughter in all that she had said .::::up
As he went down out of the room with that feeling of insult which clings to a man when he has <<target>> forced to quit a house without any farewell ceremony , he certainly did feel that he had been ill-used .::::been
But he could not but <<target>> that she was justified .::::acknowledge
There was a certain imperiousness about her <<target>> wounded his feelings as a man .::::which
He ought to have been <<target>> to be dominant .::::allowed

To tell the truth , Rachel had a thorough <<target>> cry before she went to bed that night .::::good
Though there was something hard , fixed , imperious , almost manlike about <<target>> manner , still she was as soft-hearted as any other girl .::::her
We may best describe her by saying that <<target>> was an American and an actress .::::she
It was impossible <<target>> doubt her .::::to
No one who had once known her could believe <<target>> to be other than she had declared herself .::::her
She was loyal , <<target>> , and dutiful .::::affectionate
But there was missing to her a feminine weakness , which of all her gifts is the most valuable <<target>> an English woman , till she makes the mistake of bartering it away for women 's rights .::::to
And Rachel O'Mahony cried <<target>> for hers .::::bitterly
`` It had to be done , '' she said , jumping up at last <<target>> her bedroom , and clenching her fist as she walked about the chamber .::::in
`` It had <<target>> be done .::::to
A girl situated as I am can <<target>> look too close after herself .::::not

So good-night , <<target>> . ''::::father
Then she kissed his forehead , and went up to bed <<target>> him to wonder at the intricacies of his position .::::leaving
He had that night been specially eloquent and awfully indignant <<target>> to the wrongs done to Ireland by England .::::as
He had dealt with millions of which Great Britain was <<target>> by him to have robbed her poor sister .::::supposed
He was not a good financier , but <<target>> did in truth believe in the millions .::::he
He had not much capacity for looking into questions of political economy , but <<target>> had great capacity for arguing about them and for believing his own arguments .::::he
The British Parliament was <<target>> him an abomination .::::to
He read the papers daily , and he saw that the number of votes on his side fell from sixty to forty , and thirty , and twenty ; and he found also that the twenty were men despised by their own countrymen as well <<target>> Englishmen ; that they were men trained to play a false game in order to achieve their objects ; -- and yet he believed in the twenty against all the world , and threw in his lot without a scruple and without a doubt .::::as
Nor did he understand at all <<target>> strength of his own words .::::the
He had been silenced in Ireland and had <<target>> obeyed the pledge that he had given .::::rigorously
For he was a man to whom <<target>> his word was a bond .::::personally
Now he had come over to London , and being under no promise , <<target>> begun again to use the words which came to him without an effort .::::had
As he would sweep back his long hair from his brows , and send sparks of fire out of his eyes , <<target>> would look to be the spirit of patriotic indignation ; but he did not know that he was thus powerful .::::he
Nothing had been said to him ; but as he came <<target>> he was aware that two policemen had watched him .::::home
And he was aware also that his <<target>> had been taken down in shorthand .::::words
He had heard her expound her views as to life , and had listened <<target>> she had expressed her desire to meet with some Marquis de Carabas .::::as
She had said nothing with which he could find fault ; <<target>> her whole views of life were absolutely different from his .::::but
According to his ideas , there should be no Marquises , no singing girls making huge fortunes -- <<target>> singing girls in receipt of modest sums of money ; and that when dire necessity compelled them .::::only
There should be no gorgeous theatres flaring with gas , <<target>> certainly no policemen to take down men 's words .::::and
Three or four days after this , Rachel found that a report was <<target>> at the theatre that she had dissolved her engagement with Mr. Jones .::::abroad
As Madame Socani was an American woman , there was no reason why she should not have asked the question in English -- <<target>> it not that as it referred to an affair of love it may be thought that French was the proper language .::::were
`` Mr. Jones is n't any more , as far as <<target>> am concerned , '' said Rachel , passing on .::::i
`` Oh , he <<target>> gone ! ''::::has
said Madame Socani , following <<target>> into the slips .::::her
They were both going on to the stage , but two minutes were allowed to them , while Mahomet M. Moss declared , in piteous accents , the woe which <<target>> him because Alberta , -- who was personated by Rachel , -- had preferred the rustic Trullo to him who was by birth a Prince of the Empire .::::awaited
Can it be that <<target>> was no Mr .::::there
Then Rachel flashed round <<target>> the woman .::::upon
`` I suppose there <<target>> no Mr .::::was
`` _O , mio tesor._ '' These last three words were sung in a delicious contralto voice by Elmira , -- the Madame Socani of the <<target>> , -- and were addressed to the Prince of the Empire , who , for the last six weeks , had been neglecting her charms .::::occasion
Rachel was furious at the attack made upon her , but in the midst of her fury she rushed on <<target>> the stage , and kneeling at the feet of Elmira , declared her purpose of surrendering the Prince altogether .::::to
The rustic Trullo was <<target>> sufficient for her .::::quite
`` Go , <<target>> girl .::::fond
Trullo is there , tying <<target>> the odoriferous rose . ''::::up
Then they all four broke out into that grand quartette , in the performance of which M. Le <<target>> had formed that opinion which had induced him to hold out such golden hopes to Rachel .::::gros
Rachel looked up during one of her grand shakes and <<target>> Frank Jones seated far back among the boxes .::::saw
`` Oh , he has n't left London yet , '' <<target>> said to herself , as she prepared for another shake .::::she
This came from Mr. Moss <<target>> the piece was ended .::::when
`` So they tell <<target>> ; very well .::::me
I suppose he has <<target>> business . ''::::had
Some little pecuniary <<target>> . ''::::embarrassment
Mr. Moss had probably <<target>> the rumour .::::overheard
`` I do n't <<target>> that at all .::::believe
`` Very likely , I do n't know , <<target>> will see you to your house . ''::::i
And Mahomet M. looked as though he were going to jump <<target>> the brougham in the garments of the imperial prince .::::into
`` Mr. Moss , I can go very well alone ; '' and she turned round upon him and stood in the doorway so <<target>> to oppose his coming out , and frowned upon him with that look of anger which she knew so well how to assume .::::as
`` I have that to say to you <<target>> has to be said at once . ''::::which
`` You drive about London <<target>> me in that dress ?::::with
You are painted all <<target>> your eyes .::::round
I would n't get into a carriage <<target>> you on any account . ''::::with
`` In five minutes I <<target>> have dressed myself . ''::::will
`` Whether dressed or undressed <<target>> does not signify .::::it
You know very well that I would on <<target>> account get into a carriage with you .::::no
You are taking advantage of me <<target>> my father is not here .::::because
If you accompany me I will call for a <<target>> directly we get into the street . ''::::policeman
`` Ah , you do not <<target>> , '' said Mr. Moss .::::know
And he looked at her exactly as he had looked about an hour <<target>> , when he was making love to her as Trullo 's betrothed .::::ago
`` Here is my father , '' she said ; for at that moment Mr. O'Mahony appeared within <<target>> theatre , having made his way up from the door in time to take his daughter home .::::the
`` Mr. O'Mahony , '' said Mr. Moss , `` I shall do myself the <<target>> of calling to-morrow and seeing your daughter at her apartments in Gower Street . ''::::honour
`` You will see father <<target>> , '' said Rachel .::::too
`` It will give me the greatest pleasure on <<target>> to see Mr. O'Mahony on this occasion . ''::::earth
So saying the imperial prince made a low bow , paint and all , and <<target>> the two to go down into the street , and get into the brougham .::::allowed
Mr. O'Mahony at once began <<target>> his own story .::::with
The policeman who had called for him had led him away round the corner <<target>> Scotland Yard , and had there treated him with the utmost deference .::::into
Nothing could be more civil to <<target>> than had been the officer .::::him
But the officer had suggested to him that he had been the man who had said some rough <<target>> about the Queen , in Galway , and had promised to abstain in future from lecturing .::::words
I had said that the Queen was as nearly <<target>> angel on earth as a woman could be .::::an
I had merely doubted whether <<target>> should be Queens .::::there
Thereupon the policeman shook his head and declared that <<target>> could not admit any doubt on that question .::::he
'But you would n't expect me to allow <<target>> in New York , ' said I .::::it
'You 've got to allow it <<target>> , ' said he .::::here
'But my pledge was made as <<target>> Ireland , ' said I .::::to
'It is all written down in some magistrate 's book , <<target>> you 'll find it if you send over there . '::::and
Then I told him that I would n't break <<target>> word for him or his Queen either .::::my
Upon that he thanked me very much for my civility , and told me that if <<target>> would hurry back to the theatre I should be in time to take you home .::::i
If it was necessary he would <<target>> me hear from him again .::::let
'You will know where to find me , ' said I , and I gave him our <<target>> in Farringdon Street , and told him I should be there to-morrow at half-past eight .::::address
He shook hands with me as though I had been <<target>> brother ; -- and so here I am . ''::::his
Then she began to tell her story , but there <<target>> not seem to be much of interest in it .::::did
`` Oh , yes , <<target>> 'll come . ''::::he
`` It 's something about M. <<target>> Gros , '' said he .::::le
`` He may save himself the <<target>> , '' said Rachel .::::trouble
Then they reached Gower Street , and went <<target>> bed , having eaten two mutton-chops apiece .::::to
On the next morning at eleven o'clock tidings were brought up to <<target>> in her bedroom that Mr. Moss was in the sitting-room downstairs .::::rachel
`` Father is <<target>> ? ''::::there
Then the girl , who had learned to understand that Mr. Moss was not regarded as <<target>> welcome visitor , assured her that he was at the moment entertained by Mr. O'Mahony .::::a
From which it may be gathered that Rachel had not been <<target>> in speaking of her admirer before the lodging-house servant .::::discreet
She dressed herself , not <<target>> a very great hurry .::::in
And she had to think of many things <<target>> she could go down to meet him .::::before
Meditating upon it all , she was inclined to think that <<target>> interview was intended as hostile to M. Le Gros .::::the
M. Le Gros would be represented , no doubt , <<target>> a Jew twice more Jewish than Mr. Moss himself .::::as
But Rachel had a strong idea that M. Le <<target>> was a very nice old French gentleman .::::gros
When he had uttered all those `` ve-rys , '' one after another <<target>> still increasing emphasis , Rachel had no doubt believed them all .::::with
And she was taking great trouble with herself , practising every day for two hours together , with a looking-glass before her on the pianoforte , as Mr. Moss <<target>> made her quite understand that the opening of her mouth wide was the chief qualification necessary to her , beyond that which nature had done for her .::::had
Rachel did think it possible that she might become the undoubted prima donna of the day , as M. Le Gros had called her ; <<target>> she thought it much more probable that she should do so under the auspices of M. Le Gros , than those of Mr. Moss .::::and
When , therefore , she went down at last to the sitting-room , she did so , determined to <<target>> Mr. Moss , as bidding for her voice , rather than as a candidate for her love .::::oppose
`` If only I can get this opportunity of <<target>> to you while your father is present . ''::::speaking
She remained silent , and sat square <<target>> her chair , looking at him .::::on
In a moment she had flattened every jaunty twist and turn out of <<target>> habiliments , and had given to herself an air of absolute dowdyism .::::her
Her father sat by <<target>> saying a word .::::without
`` Miss O'Mahony , if I may venture to ask a <<target>> , I trust you may not be offended . ''::::question
`` I suppose not as my father <<target>> present , '' she replied .::::is
`` Am I right in believing the engagement to be <<target>> which bound you to Mr. -- Jones ? ''::::over
`` You are , '' said Rachel , quite out <<target>> , giving another quite unnecessary twist to her gown .::::loud
`` That obstacle is <<target>> removed ? ''::::then
`` Mr. Jones is removed , <<target>> has gone to Ireland . ''::::and
Then Mr. Moss <<target>> deeply .::::sighed
`` I can manage my singing very <<target>> without Mr. -- Jones . ''::::well
And I have heard that you have made an engagement in <<target>> respects beneficial with M. Le Gros , of Covent Garden .::::all
M. Le Gros is a gentleman for whom <<target>> have a most profound respect . ''::::i
`` So have <<target>> . ''::::i
`` Had I been at your elbow , it is possible that something better might have been <<target>> ; but two months ; -- they run by -- oh , so quickly ! ''::::done
If I can do any good I <<target>> quickly get another engagement . ''::::shall
`` You will no doubt do <<target>> great deal of good .::::a
But Mr. Jones is now <<target>> an end . ''::::at
`` Mr. Jones is at an end , '' <<target>> Rachel , with another blow at her gown .::::said
`` A singing girl like me does better without a lover , -- <<target>> if she has got a father to look after her . ''::::especially
`` That 's as may be , '' said Mr. <<target>> , again laying his hand upon his heart .::::moss
The tone in which Mr. Moss repeated Mr. O'Mahony 's <<target>> was indicative of the feeling and poetry within him .::::words
`` If you had a lover such as is your faithful Moss , '' the words <<target>> to say , `` no father could look after you half so well . ''::::seemed
`` I believe I could do very well <<target>> no one to look after me . ''::::with
`` Of course you and I <<target>> misunderstood each other hitherto . ''::::have
You must excuse me , but <<target>> name misled me . ''::::the
`` Why should n't a girl be <<target>> to a man named Jones ?::::engaged
Jones is as good a name as Moss , at any rate ; and a deal more -- '' <<target>> had been going to remark that Jones was the more Christian of the two , but stopped herself .::::she
`` At any rate you <<target>> now free ? ''::::are
`` No , <<target>> am not .::::i
I am free , and <<target>> mean to remain so .::::i
Why do n't you tell <<target>> , father ? ''::::him
`` I have got nothing to <<target>> him , my dear .::::tell
You are so much better able <<target>> tell him everything yourself . ''::::to
`` If you would only listen <<target>> me , Miss O'Mahony . ''::::to
`` You had better listen <<target>> him , Rachel . ''::::to
`` Very well ; <<target>> will listen .::::i
Then she again <<target>> herself .::::thumped
And she had thumped her hair , and thumped herself all round till she was <<target>> limp and dowdy as the elder sister of a Low Church clergyman of forty .::::as
`` I wish you to believe , Miss O'Mahony , <<target>> my attachment to you is most devoted . ''::::that
She pursed her lips together and looked straight <<target>> of her eyes at the wall opposite .::::out
`` We belong to the same class of life , <<target>> our careers lie in the same groove . ''::::and
Hereupon she crossed her hands before her on her lap , while her father sat <<target>> whether she might not have done better to come out on the comic stage .::::speculating
`` I wish you to believe that I am quite sincere in <<target>> expression which I make of a most ardent affection . ''::::the
Here again he slapped his waistcoat <<target>> threw himself into an attitude .::::and
He was by no means an ill-looking man , and though he was <<target>> years old , he did not appear to be so much .::::forty
He had been a public singer all his life , and was known by Rachel <<target>> have been connected for many years with theatres both in London and New York .::::to
He had , in truth , always behaved well to <<target>> in whatever pecuniary transactions there had been between them .::::her
But he had ventured to make love to her , and <<target>> done so in a manner which had altogether disgusted her .::::had
She now waited till he paused for a moment in <<target>> eloquence , and then she spoke a word .::::his
`` What about <<target>> Socani ? ''::::madame
`` What about <<target>> Socani ? ''::::madame
Rachel , as she said this , abandoned for the moment her look <<target>> the wall , and shook herself instantly free of all her dowdiness .::::against
She flashed fire at him from her eyes , and jumping up <<target>> her seat , took hold of her father by his shoulder .::::from
He encircled her waist with his arm , but otherwise <<target>> silent , looking Mr. Moss full in the face .::::sat
It must be acknowledged on the part of Rachel that she was <<target>> to make her accusation against Mr. Moss on perhaps insufficient grounds .::::prepared
There was something in this which offended her more grossly <<target>> ever , -- and a wickedness which horrified her .::::than
But she certainly knew nothing about it ; and Madame Socani 's proposition to <<target>> had come to her from Madame Socani , and not from Mr. Moss .::::herself
All she knew of Madame Socani was that she had been on the <<target>> in New York , and had there made for herself a reputation .::::boards
Rachel had on one occasion sung with her , but it <<target>> been when she was little more than a child .::::had
`` What is Madame <<target>> to me ? ''::::socani
`` I believe her to <<target>> your wife . ''::::be
I never had a wife , <<target>> O'Mahony ; -- not yet !::::miss
Why do you say things <<target>> cruel to me ? ''::::so
He , at any rate , she was <<target>> , had sent her that message .::::sure
She thought that she was sure of his <<target>> misconduct to her in that respect .::::villainous
She believed that she did know him to be a <<target>> , whether he was a married man or not .::::devil
`` What message did you send <<target>> me by Madame Socani ? ''::::to
and again he laid his <<target>> upon his waistcoat .::::hand
`` He asked me to be -- '' But she could <<target>> tell her father of what nature was the message .::::not
`` Father , he <<target>> a reptile .::::is

`` But you can see , at any rate , Mr. <<target>> , that she does not return your feeling . ''::::moss
`` I would make her my wife to-morrow , '' <<target>> Mr. Moss , slapping his waistcoat once more .::::said
`` And do you , as the young lady 's <<target>> , think of what we two might do together .::::papa

But she , in the midst of her singing , had been much touched by <<target>> Frank Jones among the listeners in the back of one of the boxes .::::seeing
When the piece was over there had come upon her a desire to go to him and tell him that , in spite <<target>> all she had said , she would wait for him if only he would profess himself ready to wait for her .::::of
There was not much in it , -- that a man should wait in town for two or <<target>> days , and should return to the theatre to see the girl whom he professed to regard .::::three
It was only that , but <<target>> had again stirred her love .::::it
Frank Jones went back to County Galway , <<target>> caught a last glimpse of his lady-love .::::having
But his lady-love could not very well make herself known to him <<target>> the stage as she was occupied at the moment with Trullo .::::from
He refused to take any part of it , and declined altogether <<target>> incur any of the responsibilities of marriage for the present .::::to
His father 's circumstances too were of such a nature <<target>> to make him almost hopeless for the future .::::as
What would he have <<target>> her do ?::::had
Nevertheless he was very <<target>> with her .::::angry
As he made his way westward through Ireland he heard <<target>> and more of the troubles of the country .::::more
He had not in fact been gone much more than a <<target>> , but during that week sad things had happened .::::week
Boycotting had commenced , and <<target>> already become very prevalent .::::had
To boycott a man , or a house , or a firm , or a class of men , or a trade , or a flock <<target>> sheep , or a drove of oxen , or unfortunately a county hunt , had become an exact science , and was exactly obeyed .::::of
It must be acknowledged that throughout the south and west of Ireland the quickness and perfection with which <<target>> science was understood and practised was very much to the credit of the intelligence of the people .::::this
We can understand that boycotting should be studied in Yorkshire , <<target>> practised , -- after an experience of many years .::::and
Laying on one side for the moment all ideas as to the honesty and expediency of the <<target>> , we think that Yorkshire might in half a century learn how to boycott its neighbours .::::measure
A Yorkshire man might boycott a Lancashire <<target>> , or Lincoln might boycott Nottingham .::::man
It would require much teaching ; -- many books would have to be <<target>> , and an infinite amount of heavy slow imperfect practice would follow .::::written
But County Mayo and County Galway rose to the <<target>> of the art almost in a night !::::requirements
Gradually we Englishmen learned to know in a dull glimmering way what they were about ; <<target>> at the first whisper of the word all Ireland knew how to ruin itself .::::but
This was done readily by people of the poorer class , -- without any gifts <<target>> education , and certainly the immoderate practice of the science displays great national intelligence .::::of
And he heard , too , while in the <<target>> that the kennels at Ahaseragh had been boycotted .::::train
He knew that with the kennels would be included Black <<target>> , and with Morony Castle his unfortunate father .::::daly
According to the laws on which the practice was carried on nothing was to be bought <<target>> the land of Morony Castle , and nothing sold to the owners of it .::::from
No service was to be done for the inhabitants , as <<target>> as the laws of boycotting might be made to prevail .::::far
He learned from a newspaper he bought in Dublin that the farm servants had all left the place , and that the maids had been given <<target>> understand that they would encounter the wrath of the new lords in the land if they made a bed for any Jones to lie upon .::::to
As he went on upon his journey his imagination went to work to <<target>> to himself the state of his father 's life under these circumstances .::::picture
But his imagination was soon outstripped by <<target>> information which reached him from fellow-travellers .::::the
`` Did ye hear what happened to <<target>> Phil Jones down at Morony ? ''::::old
`` Divil a <<target>> thin . ''::::hear
`` Old Phil wanted to get across <<target>> Ballyglunin to his own place .::::from
He had been <<target>> to Athenry .::::down
There was that chap who is <<target>> there with a car .::::always
Divil a foot would <<target>> stir for Phil .::::he
Phil has had some row with the boys there about <<target>> meadows , and he 's trying to prosecute .::::his
A quiet , aisy-going fellow <<target>> used to be .::::he
But it seems he <<target>> been stirred now .::::has
Anyways he had to foot it from Ballyglunin to Headford , and <<target>> to send home to Morony for his own car . ''::::then
In this way did Frank learn that his <<target>> had in truth incurred boycotting severity .::::father
He knew well the old man who had attended the Ballyglunin station with almost a hopeless desire of getting a fare , and was sure that <<target>> short of an imperious edict from the great Landleaguing authorities in the district , would have driven him to the necessity of repudiating a passenger .::::nothing
But when he had reached the further station of Ballinasloe he <<target>> sadder tidings in regard to his friend Tom Daly .::::learned
Tom Daly had put no man in prison , and yet <<target>> kennels at Ahaseragh had been burned to the ground .::::the
This had occurred only on the preceding day ; and he got the <<target>> of what had happened from a hunting man he knew well .::::account
`` The hounds were out you know last Saturday week as a finish , <<target>> poor Tom did hope that we might get through without any further trouble .::::and
We met at Ballinamona , and we <<target>> Blake 's coverts without a word .::::drew
We killed our fox too and <<target>> went away to Pulhaddin gorse .::::then
I 'll be blest if all <<target>> county were n't there .::::the
I never saw the boys swarm <<target>> a place so thick .::::about
Pulhaddin is the best <<target>> in the county .::::gorse
Of course it was no use drawing it ; but as we were going away on <<target>> road to Loughrea the crowd was so thick that there was no riding among them .::::the
Ever so many horsemen got into the <<target>> to be away from the crowd .::::fields
But Tom would n't allow Barney and the <<target>> to be driven from the road .::::hounds
I never saw a man look <<target>> angry in my life .::::so
You could see the passion <<target>> was on him .::::that
He never spoke a word , nor raised a hand , nor touched his horse with his spur ; <<target>> he got blacker and blacker , and would go on whether the crowd moved asunder or not .::::but
And he told Barney to follow him with the hounds , which Barney did , looking back ever and anon at <<target>> poor brutes , and giving his instructions to the whips to see well after that they did not wander .::::the
They threatened Barney scores of times with their sticks , but he came <<target>> , funking awfully , but still doing whatever Tom told him .::::on
I was riding just behind him among the hounds <<target>> that I could see all that took place .::::so
At last a ruffian with his <<target>> struck Barney over the thigh .::::shillelagh
He turned round , and , without touching his horse <<target>> spur or whip , rode right at the ruffian .::::with
If they had struck himself , I think <<target>> would have borne it more easily . ''::::he
`` How did <<target>> end ? ''::::it
`` They said that the blackguard was hurt , but <<target>> saw him escape and get away over the fence .::::i
Then they all set upon Tom , but by G -- -- it <<target>> glorious to see the way in which he held his own .::::was
Out came that cross of his , four foot and a <<target>> long , with a thong as heavy as a flail .::::half
He soon had the road clear around him , and the big black horse you <<target>> , stood as steady as a statue till he was bidden to move on .::::remember
Then when he had the hounds , and Barney Smith and the whips to himself , -- <<target>> I was there -- we all rode off at a fast trot to Loughrea . ''::::and
`` We could do nothing but go home ; <<target>> whole county seemed to be in a ferment .::::the
At Loughrea we went away in our own directions , <<target>> poor Tom with Barney Smith rode home to Ahaseragh .::::and
But not a word did he speak to anyone , even to <<target>> ; nor did Barney dare to speak a word to him .::::barney
He trotted all the way to Ahaseragh in moody silence , <<target>> of the terrible ill that had been done him .::::thinking
I have known Tom for twenty years , and I <<target>> that if he loves any man he loves me .::::think
But he parted from me that <<target>> without a word . ''::::day
`` And then the kennels <<target>> set on fire ? ''::::were
`` Before I left Loughrea I heard the report , spread about everywhere , that <<target>> Daly had recklessly ridden down three or four more poor countrymen on the road .::::tom
I knew then that some <<target>> would be in hand .::::mischief
It was altogether untrue that <<target>> had hurt anyone .::::he
And he was bound to interfere <<target>> behalf of his own servant .::::on
But when I heard this morning that a score of men had been there in the <<target>> and had burned the kennels to the ground , I was not surprised . ''::::night
Such was the story that Frank Jones heard <<target>> to Tom Daly before he got home .::::as
On reaching Ballyglunin he looked out for the <<target>> , but he was not there .::::carman
Perhaps the interference with his <<target>> had banished him .::::task
Frank went on to Tuam , which increased <<target>> the distance by road to Morony .::::slightly
But at Tuam he found that <<target>> had in truth been boycotted .::::morony
He could not get a <<target>> for love or money .::::car
There were many cars there , and the men would not explain to him <<target>> reasons for declining to take him home ; but they all refused .::::their
He walked into town and called at various <<target>> ; but it was to no purpose .::::houses
It was with difficulty that he found himself allowed to leave his baggage <<target>> a grocer 's shop , so strict was the boycotting exacted .::::at
And then he too had to walk <<target>> through Headford to Morony Castle .::::home
When he reached the house he <<target>> encountered Peter , the butler .::::first
Why did n't they allow Mr. Flory just to hould his <<target>> and say nothing about it to no one ? ''::::pace
`` Why has all <<target>> been done ? ''::::this
`` It 's that born divil , <<target>> Carroll , '' whispered Peter .::::pat
`` I would n't be saying it so that any of the boys <<target>> girls should hear me , -- not for my throat 's sake .::::or
I am the only one of 'em , '' he added , whispering still <<target>> than before , `` that 's doing a ha'porth for the masther .::::lower
There are the two young ladies a-working their <<target>> fingers off down to the knuckles .::::very
As for me , I 've got <<target>> all on my shoulders . ''::::it
No doubt Peter was true to his master in adversity , but he <<target>> not allow the multiplicity of his occupations to interfere with his eloquence .::::did
Then Frank went in and found his father <<target>> alone in his magistrate 's room .::::seated
`` This is bad , father , '' <<target>> Frank , taking him by the hand .::::said
yes , you may <<target>> it bad .::::call
There are twenty heifers ready for market next week , and I am told <<target>> not a butcher in County Galway will look at one of them . ''::::that
`` Then you must send them on to Westmeath ; <<target>> suppose the Mullingar butchers wo n't boycott you ? ''::::i
`` It 's just what <<target>> will do . ''::::they
`` Then send them <<target>> to Dublin . ''::::on
`` Who 's to take <<target>> to Dublin ? ''::::them
said the father , <<target>> his distress .::::in
`` I will if there <<target>> no one else .::::be
We are not going to be knocked out of time <<target>> want of two or three pairs of hands . ''::::for
`` There are two policemen here <<target>> watch the herd at night .::::to

`` Who is <<target>> them ? ''::::milking
`` Your sisters are doing it , with the aid <<target>> an old woman who has come from Galway .::::of
She says she has not long to live , and with <<target>> help of half-a-crown a day cares nothing for the Landleaguers .::::the
Then Frank passed on through the house to find <<target>> sisters , or Flory as it might be .::::his
He had said not a word to his father in regard to Florian , fearing to <<target>> upon a subject which , as he well knew , must be very sore .::::touch
Had Florian told the truth when the deed was done , Pat Carroll would have been tried at <<target>> , and , whether convicted or acquitted , the matter would have been over long ago .::::once
In those days Pat Carroll had not become <<target>> national or even a county hero .::::a
But now he was able to secure the boycotting of <<target>> enemy even as far distant as Ballyglunin or Tuam .::::his
In the kitchen he found Ada and Edith , who had no <<target>> in these perilous days except when they could do everything together .::::comfort
At the present moment they were roasting a leg of mutton and boiling <<target>> , which Frank knew were intended especially for his own eating .::::potatoes
`` Well , my girls , you <<target>> busy here , '' he said .::::are
said Ada , who had put up her face to be kissed so as <<target>> to soil her brother 's coat by touching it with her hands .::::not
`` How is <<target>> ? ''::::rachel
`` Rachel is pretty <<target>> , I believe .::::well
We will not talk of <<target>> just at present . ''::::rachel
`` We will not talk <<target>> her , not now .::::about
What is all this that <<target>> happened here ? ''::::has
`` We are just boycotted , '' said <<target>> ; `` that 's all . ''::::ada
`` And you think that it 's <<target>> best joke in the world ? ''::::the
`` Think it <<target>> joke ! ''::::a
`` Why we have to be up every morning at five o'clock , '' <<target>> Ada ; `` and at six we are out with the cows . ''::::said
Your coming will be of the greatest comfort to us , <<target>> only because of the pair of hands you bring .::::if
`` How has it <<target>> with Flory ? ''::::gone
He had come forward under the hands of Captain Yorke Clayton and <<target>> his whole story , giving it in testimony before the magistrates .::::repeated
He declared it all exactly as he had done before in <<target>> presence of his father and his sister and Captain Clayton .::::the
And he had sworn to it , and <<target>> had his deposition read to him .::::had
He was sharp enough , and <<target>> well what he was doing .::::understood
They knew nothing at <<target>> , they said .::::all
They `` disremembered '' whether they had been there on <<target>> occasion , `` at all , at all . ''::::the
Yes ; they knew that the waters had been in upon the <<target>> , and they believed that they were in again still .::::meadows
They did n't think that the meadows <<target>> of much good for this year .::::were
People did be saying that Mr. Florian had done it himself , <<target>> as to spite his father because he had turned Catholic .::::so
They could n't say whether Mr. Florian <<target>> do it alone or not .::::could
They thought Mr. Florian and Peter , the butler , <<target>> perhaps one other , might do it amongst them .::::and
They thought that Yorke Clayton might perhaps <<target>> been the man to help him .::::have
They wished with all their hearts that he was n't there now , <<target>> he was the biggest blackguard they had ever heard tell of .::::because
Such was the story which was now told to Frank of <<target>> examination which took place in consequence of Florian 's confession .::::the
The results were that Pat Carroll was in Galway jail , committed to take his trial at the next assizes <<target>> August for the offence which he had committed ; and that Florian had been bound over to give evidence .::::in
`` What does Florian <<target>> with himself ? ''::::do
`` I am afraid he is <<target>> , '' said Ada .::::frightened
`` How should he <<target>> be frightened ?::::not
These men have been telling him for the last six months that they <<target>> surely murder him if he turned round and gave evidence against them .::::would
Oh , Frank , I fear that I have been <<target>> in persuading him to tell the truth . ''::::wrong
`` Not though his <<target>> were sacrificed to-morrow .::::life

`` He says that he has not <<target>> money , '' said Edith .::::the
`` Is it so bad <<target>> that with him ? ''::::as
`` I am afraid it is very bad , -- <<target>> at any rate , for the time coming .::::bad
He has not had a shilling of rent for this spring , and <<target>> has to pay the money to Mrs. Pulteney and the others .::::he
Poor papa is sorely vexed , and <<target>> do not like to press him .::::we
He suggested himself that he would send Florian over to Mr. Blake 's ; but we think that Carnlough is <<target>> far enough , and that it would be unfair to impose such a trouble on another man . ''::::not
`` Could he not <<target>> him to Mrs .::::send
Now Mrs. Pulteney was a <<target>> of Mr. Jones .::::sister

We are waiting till you speak <<target>> him about it . ''::::to
`` But what does Florian <<target>> with himself ? ''::::do
He does little or nothing , but roams <<target>> the house and talks to Peter .::::about
He did not even go <<target>> mass last Sunday .::::to

`` It is very <<target>> upon him .::::hard
I think it is papa 's idea to keep him here till after the trial <<target>> August , and then , if possible , to send him to England .::::in
There would be the double journey else , and papa thinks that there <<target>> be no real danger till his evidence had been given . ''::::would
Then Frank went out of the house and walked round the demesne , so <<target>> he might think at his ease of all the troubles of his family .::::that
Frank Jones found his brother Florian alone in the butler 's pantry , and was <<target>> that Peter was engaged in feeding the horses and cleaning out the stables .::::told
`` He 's mostly engaged in that kind <<target>> work now , '' said Florian .::::of
`` Who lays <<target>> tablecloth ? ''::::the
`` I do ; or Edith ; sometimes we do n't <<target>> any tablecloth , or any clean knives and forks .::::have
Perhaps they 'll have one to-day <<target>> you have come . ''::::because

`` Papa told them to put their <<target>> foot forward because you are here .::::best
I do n't think he <<target>> at all about himself .::::minds
I think papa is <<target>> unhappy . ''::::very
How should he not <<target>> unhappy . ''::::be
`` It 's worse than <<target>> , '' whispered Florian .::::that
`` What can <<target>> worse ? ''::::be
`` If you 'll come with <<target>> I 'll tell you .::::me
I do n't want to say it here , because the girls will hear <<target>> ; -- and that old Peter will know everything that 's said . ''::::me
`` Come out into the grounds , <<target>> take a turn before dinner . ''::::and
At this Florian <<target>> his head .::::shook
`` The very fellows that <<target>> they 'd kill me .::::said
Do you know <<target>> fellow Lax ?::::that
He 's the worst <<target>> them . ''::::of
`` All the same , <<target>> saw him yesterday . ''::::i
`` You were out <<target>> , yesterday ? ''::::then
There , at the further side of the field , I <<target>> a fellow , who I am sure was Lax .::::saw
Nobody walks like him , he 's got <<target>> quick , suspicious way of going .::::that
It was just nearly dark ; it was well-nigh seven , and I had been with Peter in <<target>> stables , helping to make up the horses , and I am sure it was Lax . ''::::the
`` He wo n't come near you and me <<target>> the broad walk , '' said Frank .::::on
You do n't <<target>> him .::::know
There are half-a-dozen places there where he <<target>> hit us from behind the wall .::::could
Come up into your room , and I 'll tell <<target>> what it is that makes papa unhappy . ''::::you
Then Frank led the way upstairs to <<target>> bedroom , and Florian followed him .::::his
When inside he shut the door , and seated <<target>> on the bed close to his brother .::::himself
`` Now I 'll tell <<target>> , '' said he .::::you
`` What is it <<target>> him ? ''::::ails
`` He 's frightened , '' said Florian , `` because <<target>> does n't wish me to be -- murdered . ''::::he

But when I had told it all at his bidding , and had gone before the magistrates , and they had written it down , and that man Clayton <<target>> read it all and I had signed it , and papa had seen the look which Pat Carroll had turned upon me , then he became frightened .::::had

And there were many inquiries made <<target>> Rachel and her theatrical performances .::::after
They had seen stories in the newspapers of the close friendship which existed between <<target>> and Mr. Moss , and hints had been given for a closer tie .::::her

`` I wonder what Captain Yorke Clayton would <<target>> about her , '' said Ada .::::think
`` He does understand music , and is <<target>> fond of young ladies who can sing .::::very
I heard him say that the Miss Ormesbys of Castlebar sang <<target>> ; and he sings himself , I know . ''::::beautifully
`` Captain Clayton has something else to do at present than <<target>> watch the career of Miss O'Mahony in London . ''::::to
This was said by their father , and was the first <<target>> he had spoken since they had sat down to dinner .::::word
`` Rachel and I have come to <<target>> each other , '' said Frank .::::understand
`` She is to have the spending of her money by herself , <<target>> I by myself am to enjoy life at Morony Castle . ''::::and
`` Is this <<target>> decision ? ''::::her
She offered to share it <<target>> with me . ''::::all
`` Well , I did n't consent ; and so we arranged <<target>> matters should be brought to an end between us . ''::::that
`` I knew what she would <<target>> , '' said Ada .::::do
`` Rachel is <<target>> fine girl .::::a
Nothing else was to be <<target>> from her . ''::::expected
`` And nothing else was possible with <<target>> , '' said their father .::::you
And so that conversation was <<target>> to an end .::::brought
On the next day Captain Clayton came up the lake from Galway , and was again engaged , -- or <<target>> to be engaged , -- in looking up for evidence in reference to the trial of Pat Carroll .::::pretended
Or it might be that he wanted to sun <<target>> again in the bright eyes of Ada Jones .::::himself
Again he brought Hunter , his double , with him , and boldly walked from <<target>> Castle into Headford , disregarding altogether the loaded guns of Pat Carroll 's friends .::::morony
In company with Frank he paid a visit to <<target>> Lafferty in his own house at Headford .::::tom
But as he went there he insisted that Frank should <<target>> a brace of pistols in his trousers ' pockets .::::carry
`` It 's as well to do it , though you should never use <<target>> , or a great deal better that you should never use them .::::them
You do n't want to get into all the <<target>> of shooting a wretched , cowardly Landleaguer .::::muck
If all the leaders had but one life among <<target>> there would be something worth going in for .::::them
But it is well that they should <<target>> that you have got them .::::believe
They are such cowards that if they know you 've got a pistol with you <<target>> will be afraid to get near enough to shoot you with a rifle .::::they
If you are in a room with fellows who see that you have your hand in your <<target>> ' pocket , they will be in such a funk that you cow half-a-dozen of them .::::trousers
They look upon Hunter and me as though <<target>> were an armed company of policemen . ''::::we
So Frank carried <<target>> pistols .::::the
`` Well , Mr. Lafferty , how <<target>> things going with you to-day ? ''::::are
I 've the decentry that bad in my innards <<target>> I 'm all in the twitters . ''::::as
`` I 'm sorry for <<target>> , Mr. Lafferty .::::that
Are you well enough to tell me where did Mr. <<target>> go when he left you this morning ? ''::::lax
I do n't know <<target>> such person . ''::::no
`` Do n't <<target>> , now ?::::you
Why , he 's first cousin to <<target>> second cousin , Pat Carroll . ''::::your

`` I do n't know nothin ' about him , <<target>> I wo n't tell nothin ' either . ''::::and
`` But he was here <<target>> morning , Mr .::::this
`` Not that <<target>> know of .::::i
Here Terry Carroll , Pat 's brother , entered the cabin , <<target>> took off his hat , with an air of great courtesy .::::and
These are bad tidings they <<target>> up at the Castle .::::got
To think of Mr. Flory having such <<target>> story to tell as that . ''::::a
`` It 's a true story at <<target>> rate , '' said Frank .::::any
`` Musha thin , not one <<target>> ' us rightly knows .::::o
It 's a long time ago , and if <<target>> were there at all , I disremember it .::::i
If Pat was to bid me , I 'd do that <<target>> any other mortal thing at Pat 's bidding . ''::::or
`` If you are so good a brother as that , your <<target>> is likely to bring you into trouble , Mr. Carroll .::::complaisance

`` Your brother is right , though I would n't have <<target>> it on any other testimony than one of themselves .::::believed

`` Do you mean that <<target>> will be murdered ? ''::::he

We must have Lax up before the magistrate for having <<target>> present when they broke the flood gates . ''::::been

`` We can make the evidence <<target>> its purpose for a time .::::serve
If we can keep him locked up till <<target>> the trial we shall have done much .::::after

As he spoke the flash of a shot glimmered across their eyes , and seemed to have <<target>> fired almost within a yard of them ; but they were neither of them hit .::::been
Frank turned round and fired in the direction from whence <<target>> attack had come , but it was in vain .::::the
Clayton did bring his revolver from out <<target>> pocket , but held his fire .::::his
They were walking in a lane just out of the town that would carry them by a field-path to Morony <<target>> , and Clayton had chosen the path in order that he might be away from the public road .::::castle
It was still daylight though it was evening , and the aggressor <<target>> have been seen had he attempted to cross their path .::::might
Hunter was standing close to them <<target>> another word was spoken .::::before
`` Did you <<target>> him ? ''::::see
`` Not a glimpse ; but I heard him through <<target>> , where the dead leaves are lying . ''::::there
There were a lot of dead leaves strewed about , some of which were <<target>> sight , within an enclosure separated from them by a low ruined wall .::::in
On leaving this the Captain was over it in a <<target>> , but he was over it in vain .::::moment
`` For God 's sake , sir , do n't go after him in <<target>> way , '' said Hunter , who followed close upon his track .::::that
`` It 's no more than <<target>> throw your life away . ''::::to
`` I 'd give the world to have <<target>> shot at him , '' said Clayton .::::one
`` I do n't think I would <<target>> him within ten paces . ''::::miss
`` But he 'd have had you , Captain , <<target>> three , had he waited for you . ''::::within
`` He never <<target>> have waited .::::would
A man who fires at you from <<target>> a wall never will wait .::::behind
Where on earth has <<target>> taken himself ? ''::::he
And Clayton , with the open pistol in his <<target>> , began to search the neighbouring hovels .::::hand
`` He 's away out of that <<target>> this time , '' said Hunter .::::by
`` I heard the bullet pass by <<target>> ears , '' said Frank .::::my
`` No doubt you did , but a miss <<target>> as good as a mile any day .::::is
That a fellow like that who is used to shooting <<target>> n't do better is a disgrace to the craft .::::should
It 's that fellow Lax , and as I 'm standing on the ground <<target>> moment I 'll have his life before I 've done with him . ''::::this
Nothing further came from this incident till the three <<target>> on their walk back to Morony Castle .::::started
But they did not do this till <<target>> had thoroughly investigated the ruins .::::they
`` Do you know anything <<target>> the man ? ''::::of
said Frank , `` <<target>> to his whereabouts ?::::as
or where he <<target>> from ? ''::::comes
Then Clayton gave some short <<target>> of the hero .::::account
He had first come across him in the neighbourhood of Foxford near Lough Conn , and had <<target>> run him very hard , as the Captain said , in reference to an agrarian murder .::::there
He knew , he said , that the man had received thirty shillings for killing <<target>> old man who had taken a farm from which a tenant had been evicted .::::an
But he had on that <<target>> been tried and acquitted .::::occasion
He had since that lived on the <<target>> acquired after the same fashion .::::spoils
He was supposed to have come originally from Kilkenny , and whether his real <<target>> was or was not Lax , Captain Clayton did not pretend to say .::::name
`` But he had a fair shot at me , '' said Captain Clayton , `` and <<target>> shall go hard with me but I shall have as fair a one at him .::::it
I think it was Urlingford <<target>> the fellow his birth .::::gave
I doubt whether he will <<target>> see Urlingford again . ''::::ever
So they walked back , and by the time they had reached <<target>> Castle were quite animated and lively with the little incident .::::the
It certainly was known in Galway yesterday , that I was to come across the <<target>> this morning , and the tidings may have come up by some fellow-traveller .::::lake
He would drop word with some of the <<target>> at Ballintubber as he passed by .::::boys
And they might have thought it likely <<target>> I should go to Headford .::::that
They have had their chance on this occasion , and <<target>> have not done any good with it . ''::::they
The men seemed to make a good joke of the <<target>> 's employment , but not so the young ladies .::::afternoon
In the evening they had a little music , and <<target>> Clayton declared that the Miss Ormesbys were grand performers .::::captain
`` And I am told that they <<target>> lovely girls , '' said Ada .::::are
`` Well , yes ; lovely <<target>> a very strong word . ''::::is
`` I 'd rather be called lovely <<target>> anything , '' said Ada .::::than
`` I meant nothing of the <<target>> , '' said Ada .::::kind
`` I hope that Captain <<target>> knows me better .::::clayton
But , Captain Clayton , you do n't mean that <<target>> 'll walk down to the boat to-morrow ? ''::::you
He 'll never have the pluck to <<target>> at me two days running .::::fire
And I doubt whether he 'll allow me <<target>> fair a chance of seeing him . ''::::so
`` I wonder how you can sleep at night , knowing that <<target>> a man as this is always after your life . ''::::such
`` I wonder whether he sleeps at night , when he <<target>> such a man as I am after his life .::::thinks
Then Ada began to implore him <<target>> to be too rash .::::not
She endeavoured to teach him that no <<target>> could come from such foolhardiness .::::good
If his life was of no value to himself , it was of great value <<target>> others ; -- to his mother , for instance , and to his sister .::::to
`` A man 's life is of no real value , '' said the Captain , `` <<target>> he has got a wife and family -- or at any rate , a wife . ''::::until
`` You do n't think the wife that <<target>> to be need mind it ? ''::::is
I can not allow that a man can be justified in <<target>> his duties for the sake of a cloudy wife . ''::::neglecting
`` A man in my position neglects his duty if he leaves <<target>> stone unturned in pursuit of such a blackguard as this .::::a
And when a man is used <<target>> it , he likes it .::::to
There 's your brother quite enjoyed being shot at , just as though he were <<target>> magistrate ; at any rate , he looked as though he did . ''::::resident
So the conversation went on through the evening , during the <<target>> of which poor Florian made one of the party .::::whole
He said very little , but sat close to his sister <<target>> , who frequently had his hand in her own .::::edith
It was not that the boy was in danger ; for the Captain thought the danger to be small , and that it was reduced almost <<target>> nothing as long as he remained in the house , -- but what would be the effect of fear on the boy 's mind ?::::to
And if he were thus harassed could he be <<target>> to give his evidence in a clear manner ?::::expected
Mr. Jones was not present after dinner , <<target>> retired at once to his own room .::::having
But just as the girls had risen to go to bed , and as Florian was preparing to accompany them , <<target>> brought a message saying that Mr. Jones would be glad to see Captain Clayton before he went for the night .::::peter
Then the Captain got up , and bidding them all <<target>> , followed Peter to Mr. Jones 's room .::::farewell
`` You 'll have breakfast first , <<target>> any rate , '' said Ada .::::at
The Captain swore that he would n't , <<target>> the girls swore that he should .::::and
`` We never let anybody go <<target>> breakfast , '' said Ada .::::without
`` And particularly not a man , '' said Edith , `` who has just been shot at on our behalf , '' But the Captain <<target>> that it might be as well that he should be down waiting for the boat half an hour at any rate before it started .::::explained
`` I and Hunter , '' said he , `` would have a fair look out around us there , so that no <<target>> could get within rifle shot of us without our seeing them , and they wo n't look out for us so early .::::one
I do n't think much of Mr. Lax 's courage , but it may be <<target>> well to keep a watch when it can be so easily done . ''::::as
Then Ada went off to her bed , resolving that the breakfast should <<target>> ready , though it was an hour before the boat time .::::be
She could manage to have <<target>> ready at half-past six .::::breakfast
`` What do you <<target>> by that ? ''::::mean
`` Did n't you tell me that a man who has to be shot at ought not to be <<target>> ; and did n't he say that he would leave his future wife up among the clouds ? ''::::married
`` He may leave her where he <<target>> for me , '' said Ada .::::likes
`` When a man is doing so much for us ought n't he <<target>> have his breakfast ready for him at half-past six o'clock ? ''::::to
There was no more then said between them on that subject ; but Edith resolved that as <<target>> as boiling the water was concerned , she would be up as soon as Ada .::::far
When the Captain went into Mr. Jones 's room he was asked <<target>> sit down , and had a cigar offered to him .::::to
`` Thanks , no ; I <<target>> n't think I 'll smoke .::::do
Smoking may have some sort of <<target>> on a fellow 's hand .::::effect
There 's a gentleman in these parts who I should be sorry should owe <<target>> life to any little indulgence of that sort on my behalf . ''::::his
`` You are thinking of the <<target>> who fired at you ? ''::::man
Not that I shall have any <<target>> at him just at present .::::chance
He wo n't come near <<target>> again this visit .::::me
The next that I shall hear from him will be <<target>> round some corner in the neighbourhood of Galway .::::from
I think I know every turn <<target>> that blackguard 's mind . ''::::in
`` Have you been speaking to Florian <<target>> him , Captain Clayton ? ''::::about
`` Not a <<target>> . ''::::word
`` Nor has <<target>> brother ? ''::::his
`` I think <<target>> . ''::::not
`` What am I to do <<target>> the poor boy ? ''::::about
`` Because of his fear <<target>> this very man ? ''::::about
`` He is only a <<target>> , you know . ''::::boy
`` Of course he <<target>> only a boy .::::is
You 've no right to expect from <<target>> the pluck of a man .::::him
When he is as old as his brother <<target>> 'll have his brother 's nerve .::::he
I like to see a man plucky under <<target>> when he is not used to it .::::fire
When you 've got into the way <<target>> it , it means nothing . ''::::of
`` What am I <<target>> about Florian ?::::do
There are four months <<target>> the assizes .::::before
He can not remain in the <<target>> for four months . ''::::house
`` What would he be at <<target>> end of it ? ''::::the
`` That is what we <<target>> to think of . ''::::have
`` Would it <<target>> him ? ''::::alter
We have to remember , Mr. Jones , how long <<target>> was before he came forward with his story . ''::::it
`` I think he will be <<target>> with it now . ''::::firm
`` No doubt , -- if he had <<target>> tell it out in direct evidence .::::to
When he is there in the court telling it , he will not think much of Mr. Lax , nor even of Pat Carroll , who will be in the dock glaring at him ; <<target>> would he think much of anything but his direct story , while a friendly barrister is drawing it out of him ; but when it comes to his cross-examination , it will be different .::::nor
He will want all his pluck then , <<target>> all the simplicity which he can master .::::and
A man , when he has taken up the cause <<target>> these ruffians , learns to sympathise with them .::::of
If they hate the Queen , hate the laws , hate <<target>> justice , these men learn to hate them too .::::all
When they get hold of me , and I look into the <<target>> of such a one , I see there my bitterest enemy .::::eyes
He holds Captain Yorke Clayton up to the hatred of the whole court , as though he were a brute unworthy of <<target>> slightest mercy , -- a venomous reptile , against whom the whole country should rise to tear him in pieces .::::the
And I look round and see the same <<target>> written in the eyes of them all .::::feeling
I found it more hard to get used to that than to the <<target>> of a pistol ; but I have got used to it .::::snap
Poor Florian will have <<target>> no such experience .::::had
And there will be no mercy shown to <<target>> because he is only a boy .::::him
Neither sex nor age is supposed to render <<target>> such feeling necessary to a lawyer .::::any
A lawyer in defending the worst ruffian that ever committed a crime will <<target>> that he is called upon to spare nothing that is tender .::::know
He is absolved from all <<target>> laws common to humanity .::::the
And then poor Florian <<target>> lied . ''::::has
A gloomy look of sad , dull pain came across <<target>> father 's brow as he heard these words .::::the
`` We must look it <<target>> the face , Mr .::::in
`` Yes , look it <<target>> in the face . ''::::all
`` He has repeated the lie <<target>> and again for six months .::::again
He has been in close <<target>> with these men .::::friendship
It will be made out that he has <<target>> present at all their secret meetings .::::been

`` Shall we <<target>> him ? ''::::withdraw
`` You can <<target>> do it .::::not
His deposition has been sworn and <<target>> forward in the proper course .::::put
`` He must tell his story once again , and must endure <<target>> torment the law-rebels of the court have in store for him .::::whatever
Only it will be well to think what course <<target>> treatment may best prepare him for the trial .::::of
You should treat him with <<target>> greatest kindness . ''::::the
`` He is <<target>> kindly . ''::::treated
`` But you , I think , and his sisters and his brother should endeavour to make <<target>> feel that you do not think harshly of him because of the falsehoods he has told .::::him
Go out with <<target>> occasionally . ''::::him
Here Mr. Jones raised his eyebrows as feeling <<target>> at the kind of counsel given .::::surprised
`` Put some constraint on yourself so as to make him feel by the time he <<target>> to go into court with you that he has a friend with him . ''::::has
`` I trust that he always feels <<target>> , '' said Mr. Jones .::::that
They went on discussing the matter till late at night , and <<target>> Clayton made the father understand what it was that he intended .::::captain
He meant that the boy should be made to know that his father was to him as are other fathers , in <<target>> of the lie which he had told , and of the terrible trouble which he had caused by telling it .::::spite
But Mr. Jones felt that the task <<target>> upon him would be almost impossible .::::imposed
He was heavy at heart , and unable <<target>> recall to himself his old spirits .::::to
He had been thoroughly ashamed of his son , and was not possessed of <<target>> agility of heart which is able to leap into good-humour at once .::::that
Florian had been restored to his old manner of life ; sitting <<target>> table with his father and occasionally spoken to by him .::::at
He had been so far forgiven ; but the father was still aware that there was still a <<target>> gap between himself and his younger boy , as regarded that affectionate intercourse which Captain Clayton recommended .::::dismal
And yet he knew that it was needed , and resolved that <<target>> would do his best , however imperfectly it might be done .::::he
On the next morning the Captain went his way , and did ample <<target>> to the kindly exertions made on his behalf by the two girls .::::homage
`` Now I know you must have been up all night , for you <<target>> n't have done it all without a servant in the house . ''::::could
`` How dare you <<target>> our establishment ! ''::::belittle
`` What do you <<target>> of Peter ?::::think
And it was poor Florian <<target>> boiled the kettle .::::who
I really do n't know whether we should not get <<target>> better altogether without servants than with them . ''::::on
The breakfast was eaten both by the Captain in the parlour <<target>> by Hunter in the kitchen in great good humour .::::and
`` Now , my fine fellow , '' said the <<target>> , `` have you got your pistols ready ?::::former
I do n't think we shall want them this morning , but <<target>> 's as well not to give these fellows a chance . ''::::it
Hunter was pleased by being thus called into council before the young <<target>> , and they both started in the highest good humour .::::ladies
Captain Clayton , as he went , told himself that <<target>> Jones was the prettiest girl of his acquaintance .::::ada
His last sentimental affinity with the youngest Miss Ormesby <<target>> feeble and insipid as he thought of Ada .::::waxed
So he passed on , and with his myrmidon reached <<target>> , without incurring any impediment from Mr. Lax .::::galway
`` I do n't think there will <<target>> any danger , '' he said .::::be
`` Captain Clayton went this morning , and the <<target>> do n't know yet whether he has gone .::::people
I think it is better that you should get accustomed to <<target>> , and not give way to idle fears . ''::::it
But he did not leave the shelter <<target>> the house without sundry misgivings .::::of
Mr. Jones had determined to act at once upon the Captain 's advice , and had <<target>> himself that he could best do so by telling the whole truth to the boy .::::bethought
`` Now , Florian , I think it would be as <<target>> that you and I should understand each other . ''::::well
Florian looked up at him with fearful <<target>> , but made no reply .::::eyes
`` Of course I was angry with you <<target>> you were hesitating about those ruffians . ''::::while
`` I can quite understand that <<target>> have felt a difficulty . ''::::you
`` But that is <<target>> over now . ''::::all
`` If they do n't fire at me it <<target>> over , I suppose , till August . ''::::is
`` They sha n't <<target>> at you .::::fire
If they fire at you , they <<target>> fire at me too . ''::::must
The father was walking with his <<target>> about the boy 's neck .::::arm
`` You , at any rate , shall <<target>> no danger which I do not share .::::incur
You will understand -- wo n't you -- that <<target>> anger against you is passed and gone ? ''::::my
I hope to be able to send you to school <<target>> England very soon after the trial is over .::::in
You shall go to Mr. Monro at first , and <<target>> Winchester afterwards , if I can manage it .::::to
But we wo n't think <<target>> Winchester just at present .::::of
We must do the best we can to get a good <<target>> for you on your first going into the school . ''::::place
`` I am not afraid about that , '' said Florian , thinking that at the time when <<target>> school should have come all the evils of the trials would have been passed away and gone .::::the
`` All the same you might come and read with me every morning for <<target>> hour , and then for an hour with each of your sisters .::::an
You will want something to do <<target>> make up your time .::::to
And remember , Florian , that <<target>> my anger has passed away .::::all
We will be the best of friends , as in former days , so that when the time shall have come <<target>> you to go into court , you may be quite sure that you have a friend with you there . ''::::for
To all this Florian made very little reply ; but Mr. Jones remembered <<target>> he could not expect to do much at a first attempt .::::that
Weary as the task would <<target>> he would persevere .::::be
For the task would be weary <<target>> with his own son .::::even
He was a man who could do nothing <<target>> which he could not do _con amore_ .::::graciously
And he felt that all immediate warm liking for <<target>> poor boy had perished in his heart .::::the
The boy had made himself the friend of such a one as <<target>> Carroll , and in his friendship for him had lied grossly .::::pat
Mr. Jones had told himself that it was his duty to <<target>> him , and had struggled to perform his duty .::::forgive
For the performance of any deed necessary for the <<target>> 's security , he could count upon himself .::::boy
But he could not be happy in <<target>> company as he was with Edith .::::his
When the time came round , Frank Jones started for Ballinasloe , <<target>> his father 's cattle and with Peter to help him .::::with
They did succeed in getting a boy to go with them , who had been seduced <<target>> a heavy bribe to come down for the purpose from Ballinasloe to Morony Castle .::::by
As he had been used to cattle , Peter 's <<target>> and Frank 's also were of less account .::::ignorance
At Ballinasloe they could not sell the cattle , as the name <<target>> Mr. Jones of Morony had become terribly notorious throughout County Galway .::::of
But arrangements had been made to send them to a salesman up in Dublin , <<target>> from Ballinasloe they had gone under the custody of Peter and the boy .::::and
But throughout the town it seemed to be perfectly understood that they were the property of <<target>> Jones of Morony Castle , and that Philip Jones had been boycotted by the League .::::philip
The poor beasts were sent on to Dublin without a truss of hay among them , and <<target>> Frank himself was refused a meal at the first inn at which he had called .::::even
He did afterwards procure accommodation ; but he heard while in the <<target>> , that the innkeeper was threatened for what he had done .::::house
Had it not been that Peter had brought with him a large basket of provisions for himself and the <<target>> , they , too , would have been forced to go on dinnerless and supperless to Dublin .::::boy
Frank , on his way back home , resolved that he would <<target>> on Mr. Daly at Daly 's Bridge , near Castle Blakeney .::::call
It was Daly 's wont to live at Daly 's Bridge when the hounds were not hunting , <<target>> he would generally go four or five times a week from Daly 's Bridge to the kennels .::::though
To Castle Blakeney a public car was running , and the public car <<target>> not dare , or probably did not wish , to boycott anyone .::::did
He walked up to the open door at Daly 's Bridge <<target>> soon found himself in the presence of Black Tom Daly .::::and
`` So you <<target>> boycotted ? ''::::are
`` Horse , foot , and <<target>> , '' said Frank .::::dragoons
`` What 's to come of <<target>> , I wonder ? ''::::it
Tom as he said this was sitting at an open window making up <<target>> horse 's drug to which was attached some very strong odour .::::some
`` I am boycotted too , and the poor hounds , which have given hours of amusement to <<target>> of these wretches , for which they have not been called upon to pay a shilling .::::many
`` Not yet , <<target>> hope , Mr .::::i

Who 's to keep <<target>> without any subscription ?::::them

The four or five hundred acres over there on the road to Tuam are <<target>> bog , and are strictly entailed so that I can not touch them .::::mostly
As there is not a tenant will pay the rent since <<target>> 've been boycotted it does n't make much matter .::::i
I have not had a shilling from them for more than twelve <<target>> ; and I do n't suppose I ever shall see another .::::months
The poor hounds are eating their heads off ; as fine a pack of <<target>> as any man ever owned , as far as their number goes .::::hounds

And I 'm over <<target>> years of age .::::fifty

Nor , indeed , had anyone in the County of Galway heard <<target>> speak so many words till this misfortune had fallen upon him .::::him
And he would still be silent and reserved with all except a few hunting men whom <<target>> believed to be strongly influenced by the same political feeling as he was himself .::::he
Here was he boycotted most cruelly , but not <<target>> cruelly than was Mr. Jones of Morony Castle .::::more
The story of Florian Jones had got about the county , and had <<target>> Mr. Jones to be pitied greatly by such men as Tom Daly .::::caused
`` His own boy to <<target>> against him ! ''::::turn
`` And to <<target>> a Papist !::::become

Then Mr. Persse rode into the yard , -- that Mr. Persse who , when <<target>> hounds met at Ballytowngal , had so strongly dissuaded Daly from using his pistol .::::the
He was a man who was reputed to have a good income , or at any rate a large <<target>> , -- though the two things at the present moment were likely to have a very various meaning .::::estate
But he was a man less despondent in his temperament than Tom Daly , and <<target>> that was likely to prevail with Tom by the strength of his character .::::one
`` Well , Tom , '' said Persse , as he walked <<target>> the house , `` how are things using you now ?::::into
I 'm afraid your father is getting <<target>> rather hot at Morony Castle . ''::::it
Is it not odd that some self-appointed individual should send out an edict , and <<target>> suddenly all organised modes of living among people should be put a stop to !::::that

There was a depth of scorn intended to be conveyed by all this , because in Daly 's estimation County Mayo was <<target>> a poor county to live in , as it had not for many a year possessed an advertised pack of fox-hounds .::::but
And the O'Tooles were not one of the tribes of Galway , or <<target>> clan especially esteemed in that most aristocratic of the western counties .::::a

Ada was making the beds upstairs , and Edith was churning the butter down below <<target>> the dairy , when a little bare-footed boy came in with a letter .::::in
`` If he 's to write to one of us it should <<target>> to Ada , '' she said to herself , laughing .::::be
Then she opened the envelope , which <<target>> a large square stout letter .::::enclosed
It contained a card and a written note , and on the card was an invitation , as follows : `` The Colonel and Officers of the West Bromwich Regiment request the <<target>> of the company of Mr. Jones , the Misses Jones , and Mr. Francis Jones to a dance at the Galway Barracks , on the 20th of May , 1881 .::::pleasure

Then there was the note , which Edith <<target>> before she took the card upstairs .::::read
Edith again looked at the envelope and perceived that the despatch had been certainly addressed to herself -- Miss Edith <<target>> ; but between herself and her sister there could be no jealousy as to the opening of a letter .::::jones
Letters for one were generally <<target>> for the other also .::::intended
I hope you <<target>> both come .::::will
You ought to do so to show the county that , though you are boycotted , you are not smashed , and <<target>> let them understand that you are not afraid to come out of the house although certain persons have made themselves terrible .::::to

I hope you 'll <<target>> of my Mercury .::::approve
Hunter says he does n't care <<target>> often he 's shot at .::::how
It was , in the first place , necessary to provide for the Mercury , because even a god can not be sent away after the performance of such a journey without <<target>> provisions ; and Edith , to tell the truth , wanted to look at the ball all round before she ventured to express an opinion to her sister and father .::::some
Her father , of course , would not go ; but should he <<target>> left alone at Morony Castle to the tender mercies of Peter ?::::be
and should Florian be left also without any <<target>> 's hands to take charge of him ?::::woman
And the butter , too , was on the point <<target>> coming , which was a matter of importance .::::of
But at last , having pulled off her butter-making apron and having duly <<target>> the roll of butter , she went upstairs to her sister .::::patted
`` Ada , '' she said , `` here is such a <<target>> ; '' and she held up the letter and the card .::::letter
`` Who is <<target>> from ? ''::::it
Is it Mr. Blake <<target>> Carnlough ? ''::::of
`` A great deal more <<target>> than that . ''::::interesting

`` Out of the full <<target>> the mouth speaks .::::heart

`` What does he say , <<target>> what is the card ?::::and
It looks like <<target>> invitation . ''::::an
It is from the officers of the West Bromwich regiment ; and <<target>> asks us to a dance on the 20th of May . ''::::it
`` But that 's not <<target>> Captain Clayton . ''::::from
`` Captain Clayton has written , -- to <<target>> and not to you at all .::::me

`` May I not look <<target>> his letter ? ''::::at
That would not be <<target>> all proper .::::at

`` What nonsense you do <<target>> , Edith . ''::::talk
`` Well , <<target>> it is .::::there
As you will read <<target>> , you must .::::it
You 'll be awfully disappointed , because there is <<target>> a word about you in it . ''::::not
Then Ada read <<target>> letter .::::the
`` He says he hopes <<target>> shall both come . ''::::we
Your existence is certainly implied <<target>> those words . ''::::in
`` He explains why he writes <<target>> you instead of me . ''::::to
`` Another actual reference to <<target>> , no doubt .::::yourself
But then he goes on to <<target>> of my pluck . ''::::talk
`` He says it 's a little higher than mine , '' said Ada , who was determined to <<target>> from the Captain 's words as much good as was possible , and as little evil to herself .::::extract
`` So it is ; <<target>> a little higher pluck !::::only
Of course he means that I <<target>> n't come near himself . ''::::ca
`` You would n't <<target>> to ? ''::::pretend
I do n't know any girl that <<target>> come quite up to that .::::can

`` Oh , <<target>> do ! ''::::i
`` But now about <<target>> ball ? ''::::this
`` I 've got gloves for both <<target>> us , '' said Ada .::::of
`` Put by for <<target>> rainy day .::::a

Or were they dressed <<target>> all ? ''::::at
`` To be told I 'm to wear a dress that had touched the heart of <<target>> patriarch , and had perhaps gone well nigh to make me a patriarch 's bride !::::a
But taking it for granted that the ball dresses with all their appurtenances are here , fit to win the heart <<target>> a modern Captain instead of an old patriarch , is there no other reason why we should not go ? ''::::of
asked Ada , in <<target>> melancholy tone .::::a
You go to papa , and <<target>> whether he has not reasons .::::see
He will tell you that every shilling should <<target>> saved for Florian 's school . ''::::be
`` It wo n't take many <<target>> to go to Galway .::::shillings
We could n't well write to Captain Clayton and <<target>> him that we ca n't afford it . ''::::tell
And then papa will say that in our condition we <<target>> to be ashamed to show our faces . ''::::ought
`` What have we <<target>> amiss ? ''::::done
`` Not you or I perhaps , '' <<target>> Edith ; `` but poor Florian .::::said
I am determined , -- and so are you , -- to take Florian to our <<target>> hearts , and to forgive him as though this thing had never been done .::::very
He is to us the same darling boy , as though he had never been present at the <<target>> gates ; as though he had had no hand in bringing these evils to Morony Castle .::::flood
To us he is as <<target>> as ever he was .::::dear
But they know in the county what it was that was done by Florian Jones , and they <<target>> about it among themselves , and they speak of you and me as Florian 's sisters .::::talk
And they speak of papa <<target>> Florian 's father .::::as
I think it may well be that papa should <<target>> wish us to go to this ball . ''::::not
Then there came a look of disappointment over Ada 's <<target>> , as though her doom had already been spoken .::::face
A ball to Ada , and especially a ball at Galway , -- a coming ball , -- was <<target>> promise of infinite enjoyment ; but a ball with Captain Yorke Clayton would be heaven on earth .::::a
And by the way in which this invitation had come <<target>> had been secured as a partner for the evening .::::he
He could not write to them , and especially call upon them to <<target>> without doing all he could to make the evening pleasant for them .::::come
She included Edith in all <<target>> promises of pleasantness .::::these
But Edith , if the thing was to be done <<target>> all , would do it all for Ada .::::at
Looking at it with great seriousness , as in the midst of her joking she did look at these <<target>> , she told herself that Ada was very lovely , and that this man was certainly lovable .::::things
And she had taken it into her imagination that Captain Clayton <<target>> certainly in the road to fall in love with Ada .::::was
Why should not Ada <<target>> her chance ?::::have
And why should not <<target>> Captain have his ?::::the
Why should not she have her chance of <<target>> a gallant lovable gentleman for a brother-in-law ?::::having
Edith was not at all prepared to give the world up for lost , because Pat Carroll <<target>> made himself a brute , and because the neighbours were idiots and had boycotted them .::::had
It must all depend upon their father , whether <<target>> should or should not go to the ball .::::they
And she had not thought it prudent to appear too full of hope when talking of it to <<target>> ; but for herself she quite agreed with the Captain that policy required them to go .::::ada
`` I suppose you <<target>> like it ? ''::::would
she said to <<target>> sister .::::her
`` I always was fond of <<target>> , '' replied Ada .::::dancing
`` Especially with <<target>> . ''::::heroes
`` Of course you laugh at me , but Captain Clayton wo n't <<target>> there as an officer ; he 's only a resident magistrate . ''::::be
`` He 's the best of all the <<target>> , '' said Edith with enthusiasm .::::officers
`` I wo n't have <<target>> hero run down .::::our
I believe him to have twice as much <<target>> him as any of the officers .::::in
He 's the gallantest <<target>> I know .::::fellow
I think we ought to go , if <<target>> 's only because he wants it . ''::::it
`` I do n't want not <<target>> go , '' said Ada .::::to
`` I daresay not ; but <<target>> will be the difficulty . ''::::papa
`` He 'll think more of <<target>> than of me , Edith .::::you
Suppose you go and <<target>> to him . ''::::talk
So it was decided ; and Edith went away to <<target>> father , leaving Ada still among the beds .::::her
Of Frank not a <<target>> had been spoken .::::word
Frank would go as a matter <<target>> course if Mr. Jones consented .::::of
But Ada , though she was left among the beds , did not at once go on with her work ; but <<target>> down on that special bed by which her attention was needed , and thought of the circumstances which surrounded her .::::sat
Was it a fact that she <<target>> in love with the Captain ?::::was
To be in love to her was a <<target>> serious thing , -- but so delightful .::::very
The one young man was an officer , but was now in India , and <<target>> had not ventured even to mention his name in her father 's presence .::::ada
She had said that Lieutenant Talbot was no better than a <<target>> , although he had Â£400 a year of his own .::::stick
`` He 'd give you nothing to talk about , '' <<target>> Edith , `` but his Â£400 a year . ''::::said
Therefore when Lieutenant Talbot went to India , <<target>> Jones did not break her heart .::::ada
But now Edith called Captain Clayton a hero , and seemed in all respects to <<target>> of him ; and Edith seemed to think that he certainly admired Ada .::::approve
It was a dreadful thing to have <<target>> fall in love with a woodcock .::::to
Ada felt that if , as things went on , the woodcock should become her <<target>> , the bullet which reached his heart would certainly pierce her own bosom also .::::woodcock
But such was the <<target>> of the world .::::way
Edith had seemed to think that the man was entitled to have a lady of his own to love ; <<target>> if so , Ada seemed to think that the place would be one very well suited to herself .::::and
Therefore she was anxious for the ball ; and at the present moment thought only <<target>> the difficulties to be incurred by Edith in discussing the matter with her father .::::of
`` Papa , Captain Clayton wants us to go to a ball <<target>> Galway , '' it was thus that Edith began her task .::::at
`` Wants you to <<target>> a ball !::::go
What has Captain Clayton to <<target>> with you two ? ''::::do
`` Nothing on earth ; -- <<target>> any rate not with me .::::at
Here is his letter , <<target>> speaks for itself .::::which
He seems to think that we should show ourselves to everybody around , to let them know that <<target>> are not crushed by what such a one as Pat Carroll can do to us . ''::::we
`` Who says that <<target>> are crushed ? ''::::we
`` It is the people who are <<target>> that generally say so of themselves .::::crushed
There would be nothing unusual under ordinary circumstances in <<target>> daughters going to a ball at Galway . ''::::your
`` That 's as <<target>> be . ''::::may
If we never show ourselves it would be <<target>> though we acknowledged ourselves to be crushed .::::as
And to tell the truth , papa , I do n't think <<target>> is quite fair to Ada to keep her here always .::::it
She is very beautiful , and at <<target>> same time fond of society .::::the
She is doing her duty here bravely ; there is nothing <<target>> the house that she will not put her hand to .::::about
She is better than any servant for <<target>> way she does her work .::::the
I think you ought to let her go ; <<target>> is but for the one night . ''::::it
`` I must go with her , I <<target>> , to keep her company . ''::::suppose
`` And are not you <<target>> of society ? ''::::fond
`` No ; -- <<target>> as she is .::::not
I like the rattle very well <<target>> for a few minutes . ''::::just
`` And are not <<target>> beautiful ? ''::::you
Do n't be such a <<target>> , papa . ''::::goose
`` To me you are quite <<target>> lovely as is Ada . ''::::as
`` You have no right to expect <<target>> have two beauties in the family .::::to
If I were a beauty I should go <<target>> and leave you , as will Ada .::::away
It 's her destiny to <<target>> carried off by someone .::::be
Why not by some of <<target>> gallant fellows at Galway ?::::these
It 's my destiny to remain at home ; and so <<target>> may know what you have got to expect . ''::::you
`` If it should turn out to be so , there will be <<target>> immeasurable comfort to me in the midst of all my troubles . ''::::one
`` It shall be so , '' <<target>> she , whispering into his ear .::::said
`` But , papa , you will let us go <<target>> this ball in Galway , will you not ?::::to
Ada has set her <<target>> upon it . ''::::heart
So the matter <<target>> settled .::::was
The answer to Captain Clayton , sent by Edith , was as follows ; but it was not sent till the boy had been <<target>> to stuff himself with buttered toast and tea , which , to such a boy , is the acme of all happiness .::::allowed
Morony Castle , 8th <<target>> May , 1881 .::::of
We will both come , of course , and are infinitely obliged <<target>> you for the trouble you have taken on our behalf .::::to
Frank will , no doubt ; but he is <<target>> after a salmon in the Hacketstown river .::::out
I hope he will get one , <<target>> we are badly off for provisions .::::as
If he can not find a salmon , I hope he will <<target>> trout , or we shall have nothing for three days running .::::find
Ada and I think we can manage a leg of mutton between us , as far as <<target>> cooking goes , but we have n't had a chance of trying our hands yet .::::the
Frank , however , will write <<target>> the officers by post .::::to
All the same , we shall be delighted to see <<target>> , if you will come down to the boat .::::you
Frank consented to go of course , <<target>> not without some little difficulty .::::but
He did n't think it <<target>> a time for balls .::::was
According to his view of things ginger should <<target>> no longer hot in the mouth .::::be
`` But why <<target>> ? ''::::not
`` If a ball at any time is a <<target>> thing , why should it be bad now ?::::good
For myself I do n't <<target>> twopence for the ball .::::care
I do n't think it is worth <<target>> ten shillings which it will cost .::::the
But I am all for showing that we <<target>> n't care so much for Mr .::::do
`` Nor yet for Terry Lax , or Tim <<target>> , or Terry Carroll , or Tony Brady .::::brady
The world is not to be turned away from its <<target>> course by such a scum of men as that .::::proper
Of course you 'll do as a brother <<target>> do , and come with us . ''::::should
To this Frank assented , and on the next day went out <<target>> another salmon , thinking no more about the party at Galway .::::for
But the party at Galway was a matter of <<target>> trouble and infinite interest to the two girls .::::infinite
Those dresses which had been put by from before the flood were brought forth , and ironed , <<target>> re-ribboned , and re-designed , as though the fate of heroes and heroines depended upon them .::::and
And it was clearly intended that the fate of one hero and of one heroine should depend <<target>> them , though nothing absolutely to that effect was said at present between the sisters .::::on
It was not said , but it was understood by both of them that it <<target>> so ; and each understood what was in the heart of the other .::::was
There was a ribbon that had not been tossed , a false <<target>> that had on it something of the bloom of newness .::::flower
A faint offer was made by Ada to abandon some of these <<target>> to her sister , but Edith would have none of them .::::prettinesses
Edith pooh-poohed the idea as <<target>> it were monstrous .::::though
`` Do n't be a goose , Ada , '' she <<target>> ; `` of course this is to be your night .::::said
What does it signify <<target>> I wear ? ''::::what
I do n't see why you are not <<target>> be just as nice as myself . ''::::to
There is quite as much depends on <<target>> good fortune as on mine .::::your
And then you are so much <<target>> cleverer of the two . ''::::the
Then when the day for the ball drew near , <<target>> came to be some more serious conversation between them .::::there
`` Ada , love , you mean to <<target>> yourself , do n't you ? ''::::enjoy
When I go to these things I never know <<target>> they will lead to enjoyment or the reverse .::::whether
Some little thing happens so often , <<target>> everything seems to go wrong . ''::::and
`` They should n't go wrong <<target>> you , my pet . ''::::with
`` Why not with me as <<target>> as with others ? ''::::well
`` Because you are so <<target>> to look at .::::beautiful
You are made to be queen of a ball-room ; not a London ball-room , where everything , I take it , is flash and faded , painted and stale , and <<target>> out ; but down here in the country , where there is some life among us , and where a girl may be supposed to be excited over her dancing .::::worn
It is in such rooms as this that hearts are won and lost ; <<target>> bid made for diamonds is all that is done in London . ''::::a
`` I never was at a <<target>> ball , '' said Ada .::::london
`` Nor I either ; <<target>> one reads of them .::::but
I can fancy a man really caring <<target>> a girl down in Galway .::::for
Can you fancy a man <<target>> for a girl ? ''::::caring
`` I do n't think anybody will <<target>> care much for me . ''::::ever
It is all very pretty , your mock <<target>> , but it is so untrue .::::modestly

Why , I can fancy a man thinking that the gods could not allow <<target>> a greater grace than the privilege of taking you in his arms . ''::::him
`` Is n't anyone to take you <<target>> his arms , then ? ''::::in
`` No , <<target>> one .::::no
I am not a thing to <<target>> looked at in that light .::::be
I mean eventually to take to women 's <<target>> , and to make myself generally odious .::::rights
Only I have promised to stick to papa , <<target>> I have got to do that first .::::and
You ; -- who will <<target>> stick to ? ''::::you

If I were to suppose that he is the <<target>> who is to have the privilege ? ''::::man
`` He is my hero , and you are my <<target>> , and I want to bring you two together .::::pet
I want to have my share in the hero ; <<target>> still to keep a share in my pet .::::and
Is not that <<target>> ? ''::::rational
`` I do n't know that there is anything <<target>> in it all , '' said Ada .::::rational
But still she went to <<target>> well pleased that night .::::bed
When the 20th of May came , the three started off <<target>> for Galway , happy in spite of their boycotting .::::together
The girls at least were happy , though Frank was still somewhat sombre <<target>> he thought of the edict which Rachel O'Mahony had pronounced against him .::::as
When the boat arrived at the quay at Galway , Captain Clayton , with <<target>> of the officers of the West Bromwich , was there to meet it .::::one
`` I do n't see that <<target>> all , '' said Ada .::::at
`` That brave little warrior , who is four feet <<target>> a half high , is intended for my escort .::::and
Two is company and <<target>> is none .::::three
I quite agree as <<target>> that . ''::::to
Then they left the boat , and Edith so arranged the party that she was to <<target>> between the small warrior and her brother , whereas Ada followed with Captain Clayton .::::walk

Mr. Moss has offered to lend me the money ; but for myself I would sooner go <<target>> an English workhouse than accept money from Mr. Moss which I had not earned . ''::::into
In truth , Rachel had been very foolish with her money , spending it as though there were no <<target>> to the source from which it had come , and her father had not been more prudent .::::end
He had latterly become more eager than ever as to politics , and was supremely happy as long as he was at <<target>> to speak before any audience those angry words which had however been , unfortunately for him , declared to be treasonable .::::liberty
He had , till lately , been taught to understand that the House of Commons was the only arena on which <<target>> permission would be freely granted , -- and could be granted of course only to Members of the House .::::such
Therefore the idea had entered his head that it would suit him to become a member , -- more especially <<target>> there had arisen a grand scheme of a salary for certain Irish members of which he would be one .::::as
But even here the brutality of England had at last interfered , and men were not <<target>> be allowed to say what they pleased any longer even in the House of Commons .::::to
Therefore Mr. O'Mahony was much disturbed ; and although he was anxious to quarrel with no one individually , not <<target>> the policemen who arrested him , he was full of indignant wrath against the tyranny of England generally .::::even
Rachel , when she could get no good advice from her father with <<target>> to her future funds , went back again to her singing .::::regard
It was necessary , at any rate , that she should carry out her present arrangement with Mr. <<target>> , and she was sure at least of receiving from him the money which she earned .::::moss
she could not practise the economy <<target>> she knew to be necessary .::::which
The people at the theatre had talked her into hiring a one-horse open carriage in which she delighted to <<target>> about , and in which , to tell the truth , her father delighted to accompany her .::::drive
She had thought that she could allow herself <<target>> indulgence out of her Â£15 a week .::::this
And though she paid for the indulgence monthly , <<target>> and their joint living nearly consumed the stipend .::::that
And now , as her father 's advice did not get beyond the very doubtful salary which might accrue <<target>> him as the future member for the County Cavan , her mind naturally turned itself to other sources .::::to
From M. Le Gros , or from M. Le Gros ' employers , she was to receive Â£300 for singing <<target>> the two months before Christmas , with an assurance of a greatly increased though hitherto unfixed stipend afterwards .::::in
Personally she as yet knew no one connected with <<target>> future theatrical home but M. Le Gros .::::her
Of M. Le Gros all <<target>> thoughts had been favourable .::::her
Should she ask M. Le Gros to lend her some small <<target>> of money in advance for the uses of the autumn ?::::sum
Mr. Moss had made to her a fixed proposition <<target>> the subject which she had altogether declined .::::on
She had declined it with scorn as she was <<target>> to do all favours proffered by Mr. Moss .::::wont
Mr. Moss had still been gracious , and had smiled , and had ventured to express `` a renewed hope , '' as he <<target>> it , that Miss O'Mahony would even yet condescend to look with regard on the sincere affection of her most humble servant .::::called
And then he had again expatiated on the immense success in theatrical life which would attend a partnership entered into between the skill and beauty and <<target>> of voice of Miss O'Mahony on the one side , and the energy , devotion , and capital of Mr. Moss on the other .::::power
had been Rachel 's only reply ; and so <<target>> interview had been brought to an end .::::that
But Rachel , when she came to think of M. Le Gros , and <<target>> money she was desirous of borrowing , was afflicted by certain qualms .::::the
That she should have borrowed from Mr. Moss , considering the length of their acquaintance might <<target>> have been unnatural ; but of M. Le Gros she knew nothing but his civility .::::not
Nor had she any reason for supposing that M. Le Gros had money of his <<target>> at his disposal ; nor did she know where M. Le Gros lived .::::own
She could go to Covent Garden and ask <<target>> him there ; but that was all .::::for
So she dressed herself prettily -- neatly , as she <<target>> it -- and had herself driven to the theatre .::::called
There , as chance would have it , she found M. Le Gros standing under <<target>> portico with a gentleman whom she represented to herself as an elderly old buck .::::the
M. Le Gros saw her and came down into the <<target>> at once with his hat in his hand .::::street
`` M. Le Gros , '' said she , `` I want you to do <<target>> a great favour , but I have hardly the impudence to ask it .::::me
Can you lend me some money <<target>> autumn -- say Â£100 ? ''::::this
Thereupon M. Le Gros ' face fell , and his <<target>> were elongated , and his eyes were very sorrowful .::::cheeks
`` Ah , then , I see <<target>> ca n't , '' she said .::::you
`` I will not put you <<target>> the pain of saying so .::::to
I ought not to <<target>> suggested it .::::have
My dealings with you have seemed to be so pleasant , and they have <<target>> been quite of the same nature down at 'The Embankment . ' ''::::not
`` My dear <<target>> lady -- ''::::young
`` Not another word ; and I beg your pardon most <<target>> for having given you this moment 's annoyance . ''::::heartily
`` There is one of the lessees there , '' said M. Le Gros , pointing back to the gentleman on the top of the <<target>> , `` who has been to hear you and to look at you this two times -- this three times at 'The Embankment . '::::steps
He do think you will become the <<target>> singer of the age . ''::::grand
`` Who is the <<target>> gentleman ? ''::::judicious
asked Rachel , whispering to M. <<target>> Gros out of the carriage .::::le
`` He is <<target>> Castlewell .::::lord
He is the eldest son <<target>> the Marquis of Beaulieu .::::of
I must not tell you what his lordship was saying <<target>> you because it will make you vain . ''::::of
`` Nothing that any lord can say of me will make <<target>> vain , '' said Rachel , chucking up her head .::::me
Then his lordship , thinking that he had been kept long enough standing on the top of the theatre <<target>> , lifted his hat and came down to the carriage , the occupant of which he had recognised .::::steps
`` May I have the extreme honour of <<target>> Mademoiselle O'Mahony to Lord Castlewell ? ''::::introducing
and M. Le Gros again pulled off <<target>> hat as he made the introduction .::::his
Miss O'Mahony found that she had become Mademoiselle as soon as she had <<target>> up her carriage at the front door of the genuine Italian Opera .::::drawn
`` I am delighted -- more than delighted , to find that my friend <<target>> Gros has engaged the services of Mademoiselle O'Mahony for our theatre . ''::::le
`` But our engagement does not commence quite yet , <<target>> am sorry to say , '' replied Rachel .::::i
Then she prepared herself to be driven away , not caring much for the <<target>> of lord and lessee who stood in the street speaking to her .::::combination
A lessee should be a lessee , she <<target>> , and a lord a lord .::::thought
certainly , '' said Rachel ; `` I <<target>> be delighted to see you . ''::::should
Then she was driven away , and did not know whether to be <<target>> or not in having given Lord Castlewell so warm a welcome .::::angry
As a mere stray lord there was no possible reason why he should <<target>> upon her ; nor for her why she should receive him .::::call
Though Frank Jones had been dismissed , and though she felt herself to be free to accept any eligible lover who might present himself , she still felt <<target>> bound on his behalf to keep herself free from all elderly theatrical hangers-on , especially from such men when she heard that they were also lords .::::herself
But as she was driven away , she took another glance at the lord , and thought <<target>> he did not look so old as when she had seen him at a greater distance .::::that
But she had failed altogether in her purpose <<target>> borrowing money from M. Le Gros .::::of
And for his sake she regretted much <<target>> the attempt had been made .::::that
She had already learned one or two <<target>> with reference to M. Le Gros .::::details
Though his manners and appearance were so pleasant , he was only a subaltern about the <<target>> ; and he was a subaltern whom this lord and lessee called simply Le Gros .::::theatre
And from the melancholy nature of his face when the application for money was <<target>> to him , she had learned that he was both good-natured and impecunious .::::made
Of herself , in regard to the money , <<target>> thought very little at the present moment .::::she
There were still six weeks to run , and Rachel 's nature was such <<target>> she could not distress herself six weeks in advance of any misfortune .::::that
She was determined that she would not <<target>> her father of her failure .::::tell
As for him , he would not probably say a word <<target>> of their want of money till the time should come .::::further
He confined his prudence to keeping a sum in his <<target>> sufficient to take them back to New York .::::pocket
As the days went on which were to bring her engagement at `` The <<target>> '' to an end , Rachel heard a further rumour about herself .::::embankment
She had heard the same sort of things said as to other ladies <<target>> the theatre , and took them all as a matter of course .::::at
Had she been asked , she would have attributed them all to Madame Socani ; because Madame <<target>> was the one person whom , next to Mr. Moss , she hated the most .::::socani
The rumour in this case simply stated that she had already been <<target>> to Mr. Jones , and had separated from her husband .::::married
`` Why do they care about <<target>> a matter as that ? ''::::such
she said to the female from <<target>> she heard the rumour .::::whom
`` It ca n't matter to me as <<target>> singer whether I have five husbands . ''::::a
`` But it is so interesting , '' said the female , `` when a lady has a husband and does n't own him ; or when she <<target>> him and has n't really got him ; it adds a piquancy to life , especially to theatrical life , which does want these little assistances . ''::::owns
Then one evening Lord Castlewell did call <<target>> her at `` The Embankment . ''::::upon
Her father was not with her , and she was constrained <<target>> the circumstances of the moment to see his lordship alone .::::by
`` I do feel , you know , Miss O'Mahony , '' he said , thus coming back for <<target>> moment into everyday life , `` that I am entitled to take an interest in you . ''::::the

In regard to you I can <<target>> say which predominates . ''::::not

As to the other , you will excuse me for saying <<target>> it is a matter between me and my friends . ''::::that
`` Among whom I trust before long I <<target>> be allowed to be counted . ''::::may
After all she was only a public singer , and as <<target>> was hardly entitled to the full consideration of a gentlewoman .::::such
It was thus that <<target>> argued with herself .::::she
Nevertheless she had uttered her little reprimand and <<target>> intended him to take it as such .::::had
`` You are coming to us , <<target>> know , after the holidays . ''::::you

`` Well , then , he <<target>> it , '' said Rachel .::::looked
`` His looks must <<target>> wonderfully expressive .::::be

The greeting between the two men was closely observed by Rachel , who , though she was very imprudent <<target>> much that she did and much that she said , never allowed anything to pass by her unobserved .::::in
Mr. Moss , though he affected an intimacy <<target>> the lord , was beyond measure servile .::::with

He had , during this little intercourse of compliments , managed to write a word or two on <<target>> slip of paper , which he now handed to Rachel -- '' Will Â£200 do ? ''::::a
This he put into her hand , and then left her , saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon her again at her <<target>> lodgings , `` where I shall hope , '' he said , `` to make the acquaintance of the most good-tempered fellow in the world . ''::::own

Mr. Moss at this interview again pressed <<target>> loan of money upon poor Rachel .::::his

She could not fail to make comparisons between him and the English nobleman who had just left her , which left the Englishman infinitely superior ; <<target>> , with the few thoughts she had given to him , she had already begun to doubt whether Lord Castlewell 's morality stood very high .::::although

During these hot words on both sides she had been standing at a pier-glass , arranging something in her dress intended to suit Moss 's <<target>> upon the stage , -- Moss who was about to enact her princely lover -- and then she walked off without another word .::::fancy
She went through her part with all her usual <<target>> and charm , and so did he .::::vigour
Elmira also was more pathetic than ever , as the night was supposed to be something <<target>> , because a royal duke and his young bride were in the stage box .::::special
The plaudits given would have been tremendous only that the building was so small , and the grand quartette became such <<target>> masterpiece that there was half a column concerning it in the musical corner of the next morning 's _Daily Telephone_ .::::a
`` If that girl would only go as I 'd have her , '' said Mr. Moss to the most confidential of his theatrical friends , `` <<target>> 'd make her Mrs. Moss to-morrow , and her fame should be blazoned all over the world before twelve months had gone as Madame Moussa . ''::::i
But Rachel , though she was enabled so to overcome her rage as to remember only her theatrical passion when she was on the <<target>> , spent the whole of the subsequent night in thinking over the difficulty into which she had brought herself by her imprudence .::::stage
She understood to the full the meaning of all those innuendoes which Mr. Moss had provided for her ; and she knew that though there was in them <<target>> a spark of truth as regarded herself , still they were so truth-like as to meet with acceptance , at any rate from all theatrical personages .::::not
She had gone to M. Le Gros for the money clearly as one <<target>> the theatrical company with which she was about to connect herself .::::of
It might be well that the company would accede to no such request ; but M. Le Gros , in his questionable civility , <<target>> told the whole story to Lord Castlewell , who had immediately offered her a loan of Â£200 out of his own pocket .::::had
It had not occurred to her in the moment in which she had first read the <<target>> in the presence of Mahomet M. M. that such must necessarily be the case .::::words
Was it probable that Lord Castlewell should on his own behalf <<target>> from the treasury of the theatre the sum of Â£200 ?::::recover
And then the nature of this lord 's character opened itself to her eyes <<target>> all the forms which Mr. Moss had intended that it should wear .::::in
A man did not lend a young lady Â£200 <<target>> meaning to secure for himself some reward .::::without
And as she thought of it all she remembered the kind <<target>> language in which she had spoken of her father .::::of
She had described him as an American in words which might so probably <<target>> this noble old _rouÃ©_ a false impression as to his character .::::give
And yet she liked the noble old _rouÃ©_ -- liked <<target>> so infinitely better than she did Mr. Moss .::::him
M. Le Gros had betrayed her , or had , perhaps , said words leading <<target>> her betrayal ; but still she greatly preferred M. Le Gros to Mr. Moss .::::to
She was safe as <<target>> with this lord .::::yet
Not a sparkle of his <<target>> had she received .::::gold
No doubt the story about the money would be <<target>> about from her own telling of it .::::spread
People would believe it because <<target>> herself had said so .::::she
But it was still within her power to <<target>> care that it should not be true .::::take
She did what was <<target>> on such occasions .::::usual
She abused the ill-feeling of the world which by the malignity of its suspicions would not scruple to drag her <<target>> the depths of misfortune , forgetting probably that her estimation of others was the same as others of her .::::into
She did not bethink herself that had another young lady at another theatre accepted a loan from <<target>> unmarried lord of such a character , she would have thought ill of that young lady .::::an
The world ought to be perfectly innocent in regard to her because she believed herself to be innocent ; and Mr. Moss in expressing the opinions of <<target>> , and exposing to her the position in which she had placed herself , had simply proved himself to be the blackest of human beings .::::others
But it was necessary that she should at once do <<target>> to whitewash her own character in her own esteem .::::something
This lord had declared that he himself would call , and she was at first minded to wait till he did so , and then to hand <<target>> to him the cheque which she believed that he would bring , and to assure him that under altered circumstances it would not be wanted .::::back
`` There is nothing like being straightforward , '' she said to herself , `` <<target>> if he does not choose to believe me , that is his fault . ''::::and
So she took up her pen , and <<target>> quickly , to the following effect :::::wrote
I want to tell you that I do not wish to have the <<target>> which you were good enough to say that you would lend me .::::Â£200
Indeed I can not take <<target>> under any circumstances .::::it
I must explain to you all about <<target>> , if your lordship pleases .::::it
I had intended to ask M. Le Gros to get the theatre people to advance me some small sum on my future engagement , and I <<target>> not thought how impossible it was that they should do so , as of course I might die before I had sung a single note .::::had
Then M. Le Gros spoke to you , and you came and <<target>> your proposition in the most good-natured way in the world .::::made
I was such a fool as not to see <<target>> the money must of course come from yourself .::::that
Mr. Moss has enlightened me , and has made me understand that no respectable young <<target>> would accept a loan of money from you without blemish to her character .::::woman
Mr. Moss , whom I do not in the <<target>> like , has been right in this .::::least
I should be very sorry if you should be taught to think evil of me before <<target>> go to your theatre ; or indeed , if I do not go at all .::::i
I am not up to all these things , and I suppose I <<target>> to have consulted my father the moment I got your little note .::::ought
Pray do not take any <<target>> notice of it .::::further
I am , very faithfully , <<target>> lordship 's humble servant ,::::your
Then there was added a postscript : `` Your note <<target>> just come and I return the cheque . ''::::has
As chance would have it the cheque had come just as Rachel had finished her letter , and with the cheque there <<target>> been a short scrawl as follows : `` I send the money as settled , and will call to-morrow . ''::::had
Whatever may have been Lord Castlewell 's general sins among actresses and actors , <<target>> feelings hitherto in regard to Miss O'Mahony had not done him discredit .::::his
He had already heard her name frequently when he had seen her in her little carriage before <<target>> steps of Covent Garden Theatre , and had heard her sing at `` The Embankment . ''::::the
Her voice and tone and feeling had enchanted him as he had wont to be enchanted by new <<target>> of high quality , and he had been greatly struck by the brightness of her beauty .::::singers
When M. Le Gros had told him of her little wants , he had <<target>> at once her innocence , and had determined to relieve her wants .::::perceived
Then , when she had told him of her father , and had explained to him the kind <<target>> terms on which they lived together , he was sure that she was pure as snow .::::of
But she was very lovely , and he could not undertake <<target>> answer for what feelings might spring up in her bosom .::::to
Now he had received this letter , and every <<target>> of it spoke to him in her favour .::::word
He took , therefore , a little trouble , and calling upon her <<target>> next morning at her lodgings , found her seated with Mr. O'Mahony .::::the
`` Father , '' she said , when the lord was <<target>> into the room , `` this is Lord Castlewell .::::ushered
Lord Castlewell , this <<target>> my father . ''::::is
Then she sat down , leaving the two to <<target>> the conversation as they might best please .::::begin
She had told her father nothing about the money , simply explaining that on the steps <<target>> the theatre she had met the lord , who was one of its proprietors .::::of
`` Lord Castlewell , '' said Mr. O'Mahony , `` <<target>> am very proud , '' then he bowed .::::i
`` I know very little about stage affairs , but I am confident that <<target>> daughter will do her duty to the best of her ability . ''::::my
`` Not more so than I am , '' said <<target>> Castlewell , upon which Mr. O'Mahony bowed again .::::lord
`` You have heard about this <<target>> _contretemps_ about the money . ''::::little
`` Nor of the terrible character which has <<target>> given you by your daughter ? ''::::been
`` She says that you wish to <<target>> all the English aristocracy . ''::::abolish
`` Peradventure ten shall be found honest , and I will not destroy them <<target>> ten 's sake ; but I doubt whether there be one . ''::::for
`` I should be grieved to think <<target>> you were the judge . ''::::that
`` It is so easy to utter <<target>> when no power accompanies the utterances .::::curses
The Lord must have found it <<target>> in regard to Sodom .::::uncomfortable
I can spit out all my fury against English vices <<target>> British greed without suffering one pang at my heart .::::and
What is this that you were saying <<target>> Rachel and her money ? ''::::about
`` She is in a little trouble <<target>> cash at the present moment . ''::::about
`` Not a doubt <<target>> it . ''::::about
`` Then there is one of the ten <<target>> any rate , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::at
Lending us Â£200 , when neither of us have a <<target>> in our pocket , is a very good deed .::::shilling
Do n't you think <<target>> , Rachel ? ''::::so
`` Lord Castlewell is not a fit person to lend me Â£200 <<target>> of his pocket , and I will not have it . ''::::out
`` You never know anything , you are <<target>> a dear , innocent old father . ''::::such
He did not look in the least annoyed because his daughter had refused to take the loan , nor <<target>> he shown the slightest feeling of any impropriety when there was a question as to her accepting it .::::had
`` Of course I can not force it <<target>> you , '' said Lord Castlewell .::::upon
`` No ; a lord can not do that , even <<target>> this country , where lords go for so much .::::in
But we are not a whit <<target>> less obliged to your lordship .::::the
There are proprieties and improprieties <<target>> I do n't understand .::::which
Rachel knows all <<target>> them .::::about
Such a knowledge comes to a girl naturally , and she chooses <<target>> the one or the other , according to her nature .::::either
Rachel is a dragon <<target>> propriety . ''::::of
`` Father , you are a <<target>> , '' said Rachel .::::goose
`` I am telling <<target>> lordship the truth .::::his
There is some reason why you should not take <<target>> money , and you wo n't take it .::::the
I think it very hard that I should <<target>> have been allowed to earn it . ''::::not
`` Why were you <<target>> allowed ? ''::::not
You are right <<target>> your generation .::::in
The people were paying twenty-five cents a night to come and hear me , <<target>> so I was informed that I must not speak to them any more .::::and
I had been silenced in Galway before ; but <<target>> I had spoken about your Queen . ''::::then
`` We ca n't endure <<target>> , you know . ''::::that
She 's a <<target>> of holies .::::holy
But I promised to say nothing further <<target>> her , and I have n't .::::about
I was talking about your Speaker <<target>> the House of Commons . ''::::of
`` That 's nearly as bad , '' <<target>> Lord Castlewell , shaking his head .::::said
`` A second-rate <<target>> of holies .::::holy
When I said that he ought to obey certain rules which had been <<target>> down for his guidance , I was told to walk out .::::laid
'What may I <<target>> about ? '::::talk
Then the policeman told <<target>> 'the weather . '::::me
Even an Englishman is not stupid enough <<target>> pay twenty-five cents for that .::::to
I am only telling you this to <<target>> why we are so impecunious . ''::::explain
`` The policeman wo n't prevent <<target>> lending you Â£200 . ''::::my
`` Wo n't <<target>> now ?::::he
There 's no knowing what a policeman <<target>> n't do in this country .::::ca
They are very good-natured , <<target>> the same . ''::::all
Then Lord Castlewell turned to Rachel , and asked her whether her suspicions <<target>> go so far as to interfere between him and her father .::::would
Here the father broke out into a <<target>> , and the lord followed him .::::laugh
`` You had better keep your <<target>> to yourself , my lord .::::money
You never can have used it with <<target>> chance of getting any return . ''::::less
This interview , however , was ended by the acceptance of a cheque <<target>> Lord Castlewell for Â£200 , payable to the order of Gerald O'Mahony .::::from
`` She has taken his <<target>> all the same . ''::::money
This was said some weeks after the transaction as described in the <<target>> chapter , and was spoken by Madame Socani to Mr. Moss .::::last
`` How do <<target>> know ? ''::::you
`` I know <<target>> well .::::very
You are so infatuated by that young woman <<target>> you will believe nothing against her . ''::::that
`` I am infatuated with her voice ; I know <<target>> she is going to do in the world .::::what

`` And she is taking <<target>> from that lord . ''::::money
`` They all take money from <<target>> , '' he replied .::::lords
`` What does <<target>> matter ?::::it

`` And she has hit me a box on the <<target>> which I have had to put up with .::::cheek

Here Mr. Moss laughed or affected to <<target>> at the idea of the dagger .::::laugh
`` I tell you that she would have <<target>> into a fellow in no time . ''::::it
`` Then why do n't <<target>> leave her alone ?::::you

`` I do n't believe a word of <<target>> , '' said the faithful Moss .::::it

`` I have not the <<target>> intention of dropping her .::::slightest
And as for you and me , we <<target>> get on very well apart . ''::::can
But Mr. Moss was anxious to find out whether any money arrangements did or did not exist between <<target>> O'Mahony and the lord , and was resolved to ask the question in a straightforward manner .::::miss
He had already found out that his old pupil had no <<target>> of keeping a secret to herself when thus asked .::::power
She would sternly refuse to give any reply ; but she would make <<target>> refusal in such a manner as to tell the whole truth .::::her
In fact , Rachel , among her accomplishments , had not the power <<target>> telling a lie in such language as to make herself believed .::::of
It was not that she would scruple in the least to declare to Mr. Moss the very opposite to the truth in a matter in which <<target>> had , she thought , no business to be inquisitive ; but when she did so she had no power to look the lie .::::he
You might say of her frequently <<target>> she was a downright liar .::::that
But of all human beings whom you <<target>> meet she was the least sly .::::could
You can make no impression with <<target>> in any other way . ''::::them
Therefore it was that Mr. Moss felt that he <<target>> learn the truth from simply questioning his pupil .::::could
`` Miss O'Mahony , may I say <<target>> few words to you ? ''::::a
So said Mr. Moss , having knocked <<target>> the door of Rachel 's sitting-room .::::at
He had some months ago fallen into the habit of announcing himself , when he had come to <<target>> her lessons , and would inform the servant that he would take up his own name .::::give
Rachel had done what she could do to put an <<target>> to the practice , but it still prevailed .::::end
Was not the girl there <<target>> show you up ? ''::::to
`` No doubt <<target>> was .::::she
But such ceremony between us <<target>> hardly necessary . ''::::is
`` I should prefer to be warned <<target>> the coming of my master .::::of
I will see to <<target>> in future .::::that
Such little ceremonies do <<target>> their uses . ''::::have
`` Shall I go down and make her say that <<target>> am here , and then come up again ? ''::::i
`` It shall not be necessary , but <<target>> take a chair and begin ! ''::::you
Then Mr. Moss considered how <<target>> had better do so .::::he
He knew well that the girl would not answer kindly <<target>> such a question as he was desirous of asking .::::to
And it might be that <<target>> would be very uncivil .::::she
He was by no means a coward , but he <<target>> a vivid recollection of the gleam of her dagger .::::had
He smiled , and she looked at <<target>> more suspiciously because of his smile .::::him
He was sitting on a sofa opposite to her as she sat on a music-stool which she had turned round , so as <<target>> face him , and he fancied that he could see her right hand hide itself among the folds of her dress .::::to

`` Ca n't he be turned <<target>> of the room ? ''::::out
`` Well , yes ; it is possible , '' said the lord , <<target>> slowly prepared to walk up and take some steps towards expelling Mr. Moss .::::who
`` It shall not be necessary , '' said Mahomet M. M. `` You could not get me out , but <<target>> would be a terrible row in the house , which could not fail to be disagreeable to Miss O'Mahony .::::there
I leave her in your hands , and I do <<target>> think I could possibly leave her in worse .::::not
I have wished to make her an honest woman ; what <<target>> want of her you can explain to herself . ''::::you
In saying this Mr. Moss walked downstairs and left the house , feeling , as he <<target>> , that he had got the better both of the lord and of the lady .::::went
With Mr. Moss there was a double motive , neither of which was <<target>> bright , but both of which he followed with considerable energy .::::very
He had at first been attracted by her good looks , which he had desired to make <<target>> own -- at the cheapest price at which they might be had in the market .::::his
If marriage were necessary , so be it , but it <<target>> be that the young lady would not be so exigeant .::::might
It was probably the expression of some such feelings in the early <<target>> of their acquaintance which had made him so odious to her .::::days
Then Frank Jones had come forward ; and like any good honest girl , in a position so public , <<target>> had at once let the fact of Mr. Jones be made known , so as to protect her .::::she
But it had not protected her , <<target>> Mr. Moss had been doubly odious .::::and
Then , by degrees , he had become aware of the value of her voice , and he perceived the <<target>> that there were in what he pictured to himself as a professional partnership as well as a marriage .::::charms
Various ideas floated through his mind , down even to the creation <<target>> fresh names , grand married names , for his wife .::::of
And if she could be got to see it in the light <<target>> saw it , what a stroke of business they might do !::::he
He did not in the least understand the <<target>> of such dislike as she exhibited .::::nature
He thought himself to be <<target>> very good-looking man .::::a
He was one of a profession <<target>> which she also belonged .::::to
He had no idea that he was not <<target>> gentleman but that she was a lady .::::a
He did not know that <<target>> were such things .::::there
Madame Socani told him that this young woman was already married to Mr. <<target>> , but had left that gentleman because he had no money .::::jones
He did not believe this ; but in any <<target>> he would be willing to risk it .::::case
The peril would be <<target>> and not his .::::hers
It was his object to establish the partnership , and he <<target>> not even yet see any fatal impediment to it .::::did
This lord who had been trapped by her beauty , by that and <<target>> her theatrical standing , was an impediment , but could be removed .::::by
He had known Lord Castlewell to be in love with a dozen singers , partly because he thought <<target>> to be a judge of music , and partly simply because he had liked their looks .::::himself
That the father should take the money instead of <<target>> daughter , was quite natural to his thinking .::::the
By keeping a close watch on her he must <<target>> it impossible for the lord to hold her .::::make
`` Why did he tell you <<target>> I was a reprobate ? ''::::that
said the lord , when he <<target>> himself alone with the lady .::::found
She would constantly remember herself , and tell herself that as long as she called him <<target>> his title , she was protecting herself from that familiarity which would be dangerous .::::by
`` Gentlemen generally are <<target>> , I believe .::::reprobates
It is not disgraceful for a gentleman to <<target>> a reprobate , but it is pleasant .::::be
The young women I daresay find it <<target>> , but then it is disgraceful .::::pleasant
I do not mean to disgrace <<target>> , Lord Castlewell . ''::::myself
`` I am sure <<target>> will not . ''::::you
`` I want you to be <<target>> of it , quite sure .::::sure
He stared at her <<target>> she said this .::::as
`` And I do n't mean to be any <<target>> 's wife , unless I downright love him .::::man
Now you may keep out of <<target>> way , if you please .::::my
I daresay you are a reprobate , my lord ; <<target>> with that I have got nothing to do .::::but
Touching this money , I suppose father <<target>> not got it yet ? ''::::has
`` I have <<target>> it . ''::::sent
`` You are to get nothing for it , but simply to have <<target>> returned , without interest , as soon as I have earned it .::::it
You have only to say the word and I will take <<target>> that father shall send it you back again . ''::::care
Lord Castlewell felt that the girl was very unlike others whom he had known , <<target>> who had either rejected his offers with scorn or had accepted them with delight .::::and
This young lady <<target>> neither .::::did
She apparently accepted the proffered friendship , and simply <<target>> him to carry his reprobate qualities elsewhere .::::desired
There was a frankness about her which pleased him much , <<target>> it hardly tended to make him in love with her .::::though
One thing he did resolve on the spur of the moment , that he <<target>> never say a word to her which her father might not hear .::::would
It was quite a new sensation to him , this of simple friendship with a singer , with a singer whom he had met in the doubtful custody of Mr. Moss ; <<target>> he did believe her to be a good girl , -- a good girl who could speak out her mind freely ; and as such he both respected and liked her .::::but
`` Of course I sha n't take <<target>> the money till it becomes due .::::back
You 'll have to work hard for <<target>> before I get it . ''::::it
`` I shall be quite contented to <<target>> that , my lord . ''::::do
Then the interview was over and <<target>> lordship left the room .::::his
But Lord Castlewell felt as he went home that <<target>> girl was worth more than other girls .::::this
She laughed at him for being a lord , but she could accept a favour from him , and <<target>> tell him to his face that he should do her no harm because she had accepted it .::::then
He had met some terrible rebuffs in his career , the memory of which had been unpleasant to <<target>> ; and he had been greeted with many smiles , all of which had been insipid .::::him
What should he do with this girl , <<target>> as to make the best of her ?::::so
The only thing that occurred to <<target>> was to marry her !::::him
And yet such a marriage would be <<target>> out of his line of life .::::altogether
The Â£200 was not spent in a manner <<target>> which Lord Castlewell would have altogether approved .::::of
The advanced Irish party had no doubt been attracted by the eloquence he had exhibited both <<target>> Galway and in London , and by the patriotic sentiments which he had displayed .::::in
He was known to be a Republican , and to <<target>> for the formation of a Republic to American aid .::::look
He had expressed most sincere scorn for everything English , and professed ideas as to <<target>> property generally in regard to which he was altogether ignorant of their meaning .::::irish
As he was a sincerely honest man , he did think that something good for his old country would be achieved by Home Rule ; <<target>> how the Home-Rulers would set to work when Home Rule should be the law of the land , he had not the remotest conception .::::though
There were many reasons , therefore , why he <<target>> be a fit member for an Irish county .::::should
But it must be admitted that he would not have been so <<target>> selected had all the peculiarities of his mind been known .::::unanimously
It might be probable that he would run riot under the lash of his leader , as others have done both before and <<target>> , when he should come to see all the wiles of that strategy which he would be called upon to support .::::since
And in such case the quarrel with him would be more internecine than with other foes , such as English <<target>> , Scotch members , Conservative Irish members , and Liberal Irish members , not sworn to follow certain leaders .::::members
A recreant one out of twenty friends would be regarded with <<target>> bitter hatred than perhaps six hundred and thirty ordinary enemies .::::more
It might be , therefore , that a time of tribulation was in store for Mr. O'Mahony , but he did not consider these matters very deeply when the cheers rang loud in <<target>> hall of the Rotunda ; nor did he then reflect that he was about to spend in an injudicious manner the money which must be earned by Rachel 's future work .::::the
When Rachel had completed her engagement with Mr. Moss , it had been intended that they should go <<target>> to Ambleside and there spend Lord Castlewell 's money in the humble innocent enjoyment of nature .::::down
There had at that moment been nothing <<target>> as to the County of Cavan .::::decided
A pork-butcher possessed of some small means <<target>> unlimited impudence had put himself forward .::::and
But The Twenty had managed to put him through his facings , and had <<target>> him to be very ignorant in his use of the Queen 's English .::::found
Now of late there had come up a notion that the small party required to <<target>> up for the thinness of their members by the strength of their eloquence .::::make
Practice makes perfect , and it is not to be wondered at <<target>> if a large proportion of The Twenty had become fluent .::::therefore
Therefore he was sent for , and on the very day of his arrival he <<target>> to the patriotic spirits of Dublin that he was the man for Cavan .::::proved
Three days afterwards he went down , <<target>> Cavan obediently accepted its man .::::and
This occurred about the end of August , and <<target>> Castlewell 's Â£200 was very soon spent .::::lord
She had not thought much about it , but had been quite willing to be the daughter <<target>> a Member of Parliament , if a constituency could be found willing to select her father .::::of
She did not think much of the duties of Parliament , <<target>> they came within the reach of her father 's ability .::::if
She did not in truth think that he could <<target>> any circumstances do half a day 's work .::::under
She had known what it was to practise , and , having determined to succeed , <<target>> had worked as only a singer can work who determines that she will succeed .::::she
But during the years that she had been so at <<target>> , she had never seen her father do anything .::::work
She knew that he talked <<target>> she called patriotic buncombe .::::what
It might be that he would become a very fitting <<target>> of Parliament , but Rachel had her doubt .::::member
She could see , however , that the Â£200 quickly <<target>> during their triumphant journeyings on the one-horse car .::::vanished
Everybody in County Cavan seemed to know that there was Â£200 <<target>> no more to be spent by the new member .::::and
There he was , however , Member of Parliament for the County <<target>> Cavan , and his breast was filled with new aspirations .::::of
But he himself <<target>> other feelings .::::had
What if he could talk over that Speaker , and that Prime Minister , that Government <<target>> , and all the House of Commons , and all the House of Lords !::::generally
Why should not England go her way and Ireland hers , -- England have her monarchy and Ireland her republic , but still with <<target>> kind of union between them , as to the nature of which Mr. O'Mahony had no fixed idea in his brain whatsoever .::::some
But he knew that he could talk , and he knew also that he must now talk <<target>> an arena for admission to which the public would not pay twenty-five cents or more .::::on
His breast was much disturbed by the consideration that for all the <<target>> which he proposed to do no wages were to be forthcoming .::::work
But while Mr. O'Mahony was being elected Member of Parliament for County <<target>> , things were going on very sadly in County Galway .::::cavan
Wednesday , the 31st of August , had been the day fixed for the trial <<target>> Pat Carroll ; and the month of August was quickly wearing itself away .::::of
But during the month of August Captain Clayton found occasion <<target>> than once to come into the neighbourhood of Headford .::::more
And though Mr. Jones was of an opinion that his presence there was adequately accounted for by the details of the coming <<target>> , the two girls evidently thought that some other cause might be added to that which Pat Carroll had produced .::::trial
It must be explained that at this period Frank Jones was absent from Morony Castle , looking out for emergency men who <<target>> be brought down to the neighbourhood of Headford , in sufficient number to save the crop on Mr. Jones 's farm .::::could
And with him was Tom Daly , who had some scheme in <<target>> own head with reference to his horses and his hounds .::::his
Mr. Persse and Sir Jasper Lynch had been threatened with a wide system <<target>> boycotting , unless they would give up Tom Daly 's animals .::::of
A decree had gone forth in the county , that nothing belonging <<target>> the hunt should be allowed to live within its precincts .::::to
All the bitterness and the cruelty and the horror arising <<target>> this order are beyond the limit of this story .::::from
But it may be well to explain that at the present moment Frank Jones <<target>> away from Castle Morony , working hard on his father 's behalf .::::was
And Peter was busy with <<target>> as their lieutenant .::::them
But it may be observed that at any period of special toil in a family , when infinitely more has <<target>> be done than at any other time , then love-making will go on with more than ordinary energy .::::to
Edith was generally to be found with her hair tucked tight off her face and enveloped in a coarse dairymaid 's apron , and Ada , when she ran downstairs , would do so with a <<target>> 's dusting-brush at her girdle , and they were neither of them , when so attired , in the least afraid of encountering Captain Clayton as he would come out from their father 's room .::::housemaid
All the world knew that they were being boycotted , <<target>> very happy the girls were during the process .::::and
`` Poor papa '' did <<target>> like it so well .::::not
Poor papa thought of his banker 's account , or rather of that bank <<target>> which there was , so to say , no longer any account .::::at
But the girls were light of heart , <<target>> in the pride of their youth .::::and
they had both of <<target>> blundered frightfully .::::them
It was Edith , Edith the prudent , Edith the wise , Edith , who was supposed to know everything , who had <<target>> gone astray in her blundering , and had taken Ada with her ; but the story with its details must be told .::::first
`` My pet , '' she said to her elder sister , as they were standing together <<target>> the kitchen dresser , `` I know he means to speak to you to-day . ''::::at
`` It has to be done <<target>> day , you know .::::some
And he is just the man to come upon <<target>> in the time of one 's dire distress .::::one
Of course we have n't got <<target>> halfpenny now belonging to us .::::a
I was thinking only the other day how comfortable it is that we never <<target>> out of the house because we have n't the means to buy boots .::::go
Now Captain Clayton is just the man to <<target>> doubly attracted by such penury . ''::::be
`` I do n't know why a man is to make an offer <<target>> a girl just because he finds her working like a housemaid . ''::::to
I can see <<target>> all .::::it
He is just the man to take you in <<target>> arms because he found you peeling potatoes . ''::::his
`` I beg he will do nothing <<target>> the kind , '' said Ada .::::of
`` He has never said a word to me , <<target>> I to him , to justify such a proceeding .::::or
I should at once hit him over <<target>> head with my brush . ''::::the
`` Here he comes , and now we will <<target>> how far I understand such matters . ''::::see
`` Do n't go , <<target>> , '' said Ada .::::edith
If you go I <<target>> go with you .::::shall
These things ought always to come naturally , -- <<target>> is if they come at all . ''::::that
It did not `` come '' at that moment , for Edith was so far mistaken that Captain Clayton , <<target>> saying a few words to the girls , passed on out of the back-door , intent on special business .::::after
`` What a wretched individual he <<target>> , '' said Edith .::::is
`` Fancy pinning one 's character on the <<target>> of such a man as that .::::doings
However , he will be back again to dinner , and you <<target>> not be so hard upon him then with your dusting-brush . ''::::will
Before dinner the Captain did return , and <<target>> himself alone with Edith in the kitchen .::::found
It was her turn on this occasion to send up whatever <<target>> in the shape of dinner Castle Morony could afford .::::meal
`` It will make a very good dinner , -- or a very bad one , <<target>> to circumstances , as they may fall out before the dinner leaves the kitchen . ''::::according
`` Then they will have to fall <<target>> very quickly , '' said Edith .::::out
But the colour had flown to her face , and <<target>> that moment she had learned to suspect the truth .::::in
And her mind flew back rapidly over all her <<target>> and sayings for the last three months .::::doings
If it was so , <<target>> could never forgive herself .::::she
If it was so , <<target>> would never forgive her .::::ada
If it was so , they two and <<target>> Yorke Clayton must be separated for ever .::::captain
`` Well ; what <<target>> it ? ''::::is
The joint of meat had fallen from her hands , and she looked up <<target>> Captain Clayton with all the anger she could bring into her face .::::at
`` Edith , '' he said , `` <<target>> surely know that I love you . ''::::you
`` I know nothing <<target>> the kind .::::of
There can be no reason why I should know <<target>> , -- why I should guess it .::::it
It can not be so without <<target>> wrong on your part . ''::::grievous
`` Base wrong done to my <<target>> , '' she answered .::::sister
Then she remembered that she had betrayed her sister , and she remembered too how much of the <<target>> love-making had been done by her own words , and not by any spoken by Captain Clayton .::::supposed
And there came upon her at that moment a remembrance also of that other moment in which she had acknowledged to herself that she had loved this man , and had told herself that the love <<target>> vain , and had sworn to herself that she would never stand in Ada 's way , and had promised to herself that all things should be happy to her as this man 's sister-in-law .::::was
Acting then on this idea merely because Ada had been beautiful she <<target>> gone to work , -- and this had come of it !::::had
In that minute that was allowed to her as the boiled mutton was cooling <<target>> the dresser beneath her hand , all this passed through her mind .::::on
`` Wrong done by <<target>> to Ada ! ''::::me
`` I have said it ; but if <<target>> are a gentleman you will forget it .::::you
I know that you are a gentleman , -- a <<target>> man , such as few I think exist anywhere .::::gallant
Captain Clayton , there are <<target>> two of us .::::but
Take the best ; take the <<target>> ; take the sweetest .::::fairest
Let all this be as though <<target>> had never been spoken .::::it
I will be such a sister to you <<target>> no man ever won for himself .::::as
And Ada will be as loving a wife <<target>> ever graced a man 's home .::::as
Let it be so , and I will <<target>> every day of your life . ''::::bless
`` No , '' he said slowly , `` <<target>> can not let it be like that .::::i
I have learned to love you and you only , <<target>> I thought that you had known it . ''::::and
`` I had <<target>> so .::::thought
It can not be <<target>> you propose .::::as
I shall never speak of your <<target>> to a living man .::::sister
I shall never whisper a word of her <<target>> even here in her own family .::::regard
But I can not change <<target>> heart as you propose .::::my
These things go , I <<target>> , without any effort .::::think
I have known that there has been no attempt on your part ; but the <<target>> has been done and I had hoped that you were aware of it .::::thing
It can not <<target>> be undone .::::now
I can not be <<target>> on to another .::::passed
`` There is no other girl in all Ireland that can <<target>> her place if she be lost to me . ''::::supply
He had spoken very solemnly , and she had <<target>> there in solemn mood listening to him .::::stood
By degrees the conviction had come upon her that he was in earnest , and was <<target>> to be changed in his purpose by anything that she could say to him .::::not
She had blundered , <<target>> blundered awfully .::::had
She had thought that with a man beauty would be everything ; but with this man <<target>> had been nothing ; nor had good temper and a sense of duty availed anything .::::beauty
She rushed into the dining-room carrying the boiled <<target>> with her , and he followed .::::mutton
What should she <<target>> now ?::::do
Ada would yield -- would give him up -- would retire into the background , and would <<target>> that Edith should be made happy , but would never lift up her head again .::::declare
And she -- she herself -- could also give him <<target>> , and would lift up her head again .::::up
She knew that she had a power of bearing sorrow , and going on with the <<target>> of the world , in spite of all troubles , which Ada did not possess .::::work
It might , therefore , have all been settled , but <<target>> the man was stubborn , and would not be changed .::::that
`` Of course , he is a man , '' said <<target>> to herself , as she put the mutton down .::::edith
`` Of course he must have <<target>> all to please himself .::::it
Of course he will <<target>> selfish . ''::::be
`` I thought you were never coming with our <<target>> of dinner , '' said Mr. Jones .::::morsel
`` Here is the morsel of dinner ; but I could have dished <<target>> in half the time if Captain Clayton had not been there . ''::::it
`` And now I have forgotten <<target>> bring the potatoes . ''::::to
So he started off , and met Florian <<target>> the door coming in with them .::::at
Mr. Jones carved the mutton , <<target>> Captain Clayton was helped first .::::and
In a boycotted house you will always find <<target>> the gentlemen are helped before the ladies .::::that
It is a part of the principle <<target>> boycotting that women shall subject themselves .::::of
Captain Clayton , after his first little stir about <<target>> potatoes , ate his dinner in perfect silence .::::the
That which had taken place upset him more completely <<target>> the rifles of two or three Landleaguers .::::than
Mr. Jones was <<target>> silent .::::also
He was a man at the present <<target>> nearly overwhelmed by his cares .::::moment
As Edith looked at her furtively she began <<target>> fear that her pet suspected something .::::to
There was a look of suffering in her face which Edith could read , <<target>> it was not plain enough written there to be legible to others .::::though
Her father and Florian had no key by which to read it , <<target>> Captain Clayton never allowed his eyes to turn towards Ada 's face .::::and
But it was imperative on both that they should not all <<target>> into some feeling of special sorrow through their silence .::::fall
`` It will be much better to have <<target>> over , '' said the father .::::it
`` I do not think you need come back <<target>> all , but start at once from Galway .::::at
`` I sha n't mind it so much when <<target>> get to England , '' said the boy .::::i
`` I suppose I shall come <<target>> for the Christmas holidays . ''::::home
`` I do n't know about <<target>> , '' said the father .::::that
`` It will depend upon the <<target>> of the country . ''::::state
`` You will come and <<target>> him , Ada ? ''::::meet
And her sister knew from the tone of <<target>> voice that some evil was already suspected .::::her
There was nothing more said that night <<target>> Edith and Ada were together .::::till
Mr. Jones lingered with his daughters , and the Captain took Florian out about the orchard , thinking it <<target>> to make him used to whatever danger might come to him from being out of the house .::::well
And they wo n't come for <<target>> chance of a pop shot .::::the
I am getting to know their ways as well <<target>> though I had lived there all my life .::::as
They count on the acquittal of <<target>> Carroll as a certainty .::::pat
Whatever I may be , you are tolerably safe <<target>> long as that is the case . ''::::as
`` They may shoot me in mistake <<target>> you , '' said the boy .::::for
Let us go back <<target>> the house .::::to
But I do n't think there would <<target>> any danger to-night anyway . ''::::be
He was very melancholy in these days , as a <<target>> must be whom ruin stares in the face .::::man
Edith had followed Ada upstairs to the bedrooms , and had crept <<target>> her into that which had been prepared for Captain Clayton .::::after
She could see now by the lingering light of an August evening that a tear <<target>> fallen from each eye , and had slowly run down her sister 's cheeks .::::had
`` My girl , my <<target>> , my darling !::::beauty
Much or little , <<target>> is it ?::::what
Can not you <<target>> me ? ''::::tell
`` He cares nothing for me , '' said Ada , laying her hand <<target>> the pillow , thus indicating the `` he '' whom she intended .::::upon
Edith answered not a word , but pressed <<target>> arm tight round her sister 's waist .::::her
`` It is so , '' said Ada , turning <<target>> upon her sister as though to rebuke her .::::round
`` You know that <<target>> is so . ''::::it
`` You know <<target>> is so .::::it
It is not me that he <<target>> ; it is you .::::loves
You are his <<target>> one .::::chosen
Then she flung herself down upon the bed <<target>> her own hands had prepared for him .::::which
As the assertions had come from her one by one , Edith <<target>> found herself unable to deny a tittle of what was said .::::had
`` Ada , if you knew <<target>> heart to you . ''::::my
`` What good <<target>> it ?::::is
Why did you teach me <<target>> believe a falsehood ? ''::::to
you will kill me <<target>> you accuse me .::::if

`` Ada , have I not <<target>> true to you ? ''::::been
`` But that you should have been so much <<target>> ; -- you , who know everything . ''::::mistaken
`` I have not known <<target>> , '' said Edith .::::him
`` You will be <<target>> wife . ''::::his
Then slowly , Ada got up from the bed and shook her <<target>> from off her face and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief .::::hair

`` Yes , Edith , <<target>> must and he shall .::::he

Come , '' she said , `` I <<target>> make his bed for him once again .::::must
He will be here soon now <<target>> we must be away . ''::::and
Then she did obliterate the traces of her form which her figure had made upon the bed , <<target>> smoothed the pillow , and wiped away the mark of her tear which had fallen on it .::::and
He shall be your husband , and I will be his <<target>> , and all shall be bright between you . ''::::sister
He will never be married if <<target>> waits for me . ''::::he

Such were the last words which <<target>> between them on that night .::::passed
There came tidings to Morony Castle of the <<target>> honours which Mr. O'Mahony had achieved .::::new
`` I do n't know that the country will be much <<target>> wiser for his services , '' said Captain Clayton .::::the
`` He will go altogether <<target>> those wretched Landleaguers . ''::::with
`` He will be the best of <<target>> lot , '' said Mr. Jones .::::the
`` It is saying very little for <<target>> , '' said Captain Clayton .::::him

`` He wo n't remain a <<target>> long if he is honest .::::landleaguer
But what about <<target>> daughter ? ''::::his
`` Frank has seen her down in Cavan , and declares that she <<target>> about to make any amount of money at the London theatres . ''::::is

`` But I 'll bet any man a new hat that there is a <<target>> between him and them before the next Parliament is half over . ''::::split
This took place during one of the visits which Captain Clayton <<target>> made to Morony Castle in reference to the coming trial .::::had
Florian had been already sent on to Mr. Blake 's of Carnlough , and was to be picked up there on that very <<target>> by Mr. Jones , and driven to Ballyglunin , so as to be taken from thence to the assize town by train .::::afternoon

It would have been so for <<target>> had such been her luck .::::her
But of herself <<target>> said nothing .::::she
Mr. Jones said nothing further at the moment , but before the girls <<target>> separated for the night Ada had told Edith what had occurred .::::had

They were to be to her the dearest friends of her future life , and she <<target>> not let the knowledge of such a story stand in her way or theirs .::::would
The train was to start from the <<target>> station for Athenry at 4.20 p.m .::::ballyglunin
It would then have left Tuam for Athenry , where it <<target>> fall into the day mail-train from Dublin to Galway .::::would
It was something out of the way for Mr. Jones to call at Carnlough ; but <<target>> was not three miles from Ballyglunin , and Mr. Jones made his arrangements accordingly .::::carnlough
He called at Carnlough , and there took <<target>> the boy on his outside car .::::up
Peter had come with him , so as <<target>> take back the car to Morony Castle .::::to
`` I 'm not <<target>> , Mr .::::afeared
I do n't believe you are <<target>> as you call it . ''::::afeared
`` Then why do you be talking <<target>> me like that , sir ? ''::::at
`` I do n't think you are a coward , but you <<target>> anxious to make the most of your services on my behalf .::::are
You are telling everyone that something special is due <<target>> you for staying in a boycotted house .::::to
`` Why do you talk to a <<target>> boy in that way ? ''::::poor
`` So that the poor <<target>> may understand me .::::boy
You are willing , I believe , to stick to <<target>> old master , -- from sheer good heart .::::your
But you like to <<target>> about it .::::talk
Now I do n't like <<target>> hear about it . ''::::to
After that Peter drove on in <<target>> till they came to Carnlough .::::silence
`` Now do take care of the poor <<target>> boy , '' said Mrs. Blake .::::dear
`` There are such dreadful stories told <<target>> horrible men about the country . ''::::of
`` Do n't mention such nonsense , Winifred , '' <<target>> her husband , `` trying to frighten the boy .::::said
There is n't a human being between this and <<target>> for whom I wo n't be responsible .::::ballyglunin
Till you come to a mile of the <<target>> it 's all my own property . ''::::station
`` But they can shoot -- '' Then Mrs. Blake left the rest <<target>> her sentence unspoken , having been checked by her husband 's eye .::::of
The boy , however , <<target>> heard it and trembled .::::had
`` Get up along <<target>> Peter . ''::::with
The attempt which he had made to live with his <<target>> on affectionate paternal relations had hardly been successful .::::son
The boy had been told so much of <<target>> that he had been made to fear .::::murderers
He had seemed to prefer to shrink and cower and be mysterious with <<target>> Carrolls to coming forward boldly with such a man as Yorke Clayton .::::the
The girls had seen this , and had declared that he was no more than <<target>> boy ; but his father had seen it and had made no such allowance .::::a
And now he saw <<target>> he trembled .::::that
But Florian got up on the car , <<target>> Peter drove them off to Ballyglunin .::::and
He sat alone on the near side of the car , and <<target>> sat on the other , together with Peter who was driving .::::florian
The horse was a heavy , slow-going animal , rough and <<target>> in its coat , but trustworthy and an old servant .::::hairy
The carriage horses had been sold after the flood , -- as Ada had called the memorable incident ; and now there <<target>> but three cart horses at Morony Castle , of which this one animal alone was habitually driven in the car .::::were
The floods , indeed , had now retreated from the lands of Ballintubber and the flood gates were mended ; but there would be <<target>> crop of hay on all those eighty acres this year , and Mr. Jones was in no condition to replace his private stud .::::no
As he went along on this present journey he was <<target>> bitterly of the injury which had been done him .::::thinking
He had lost over two hundred tons of hay , and each <<target>> of hay would have been worth three pounds ten shillings .::::ton
He had been unable to get a sluice gate mended till men had been brought together from Monaghan and parts of Cavan to mend them for him , and he had even to send <<target>> men into Limerick to buy the material , as not a piece of timber could be procured in Galway for the use of a household so well boycotted as was Morony Castle .::::these
There had been also various calls on Mr. Jones from those <<target>> whose money had been left as mortgages on his property .::::relatives
Every man 's hand was against him ; so <<target>> there was no money in his coffers .::::that
He who had chiefly sinned against him , -- who was the first to <<target>> , -- was the sinner whom he was about to prosecute at Galway .::::sin
It must be supposed , therefore , that he was not in <<target>> good humour as he was driven along the road to Ballyglunin .::::a
They had not yet passed the boundary fence between Carnlough and the property of one of the numerous race of Bodkins , when Mr. Jones saw a mask , <<target>> he supposed to be a mask worn by a man , through a hole in the wall just in front of him , but high above his head .::::which
And at the same moment he could see the muzzles of <<target>> double-barrelled rifle presented through the hole in the wall .::::a
What he saw he saw but for a few <<target>> ; but he could see it plainly .::::seconds
He saw it so plainly as to be able afterwards to <<target>> to a black mask , and to a double-barrelled gun .::::swear
Then a trigger was pulled , and one bullet -- the second -- went through the collar <<target>> his own coat , while the first had had a more fatal and truer aim .::::of
The father jumped up and turning round saw <<target>> his boy had fallen to the ground .::::that
`` Oh , <<target>> God ! ''::::my
said Peter , and he <<target>> the horse suddenly .::::stopped
The place was one where the commencement had been made of a cutting in the road during the potato failure of 1846 ; <<target>> that the wall and the rifle which had been passed through it were about four or five feet above the car .::::so
Mr. Jones rushed up the elevation , and clambered , <<target>> did not know how , into the field .::::he
There he saw the back of a man speeding along from the <<target>> , and in the man 's hand there was a gun .::::wall
Mr. Jones looked around but there was no one nigh him <<target>> Peter , the old servant , and his dying boy .::::but
He could see , however , that the <<target>> who ran was short of stature .::::man
But though his rage had sufficed to carry him up from the road into the field , the idea that <<target>> son had been shot caused him to pause as he ran , and to return to the road .::::his
When he got there he found two girls about seventeen and eighteen years of age , one sitting on the <<target>> with Florian 's head on her lap , and the other kneeling and holding the boy 's hands .::::road
`` Oh , <<target>> honour !::::yer
sorrow a taste in life do we know <<target>> it , '' said the kneeling girl .::::about
Mr. Jones came round and picked up poor <<target>> and laid him on the car .::::florian
The bullet had gone true to its mark <<target>> had buried itself in his brain .::::and
There was the end of poor <<target>> Jones and all his troubles .::::florian
Not a tear came <<target>> his relief .::::to
Nor during this half hour can he <<target>> have been said to sorrow .::::hardly
An intensity of wrath <<target>> his breast .::::filled
He had spent his time for many a long year in doing all in his <<target>> for those around him , and now they had brought him to this .::::power
They had robbed him of <<target>> boy 's heart .::::his
And now , because he had yielded to <<target>> teachings , they had murdered him .::::better
They had taught his boy to be a coward ; for <<target>> in his bereavement he remembered poor Florian 's failing .::::even
The accursed Papist people were all <<target>> down to their backbones .::::cowards
So he said of <<target>> in his rage .::::them
There was not one of them who could look any peril <<target>> the face as did Yorke Clayton or his son Frank .::::in
But they were terribly powerful in <<target>> wretched want of manliness .::::their
They could murder , and were protected <<target>> their bloodthirstiness one by another .::::in
He did not doubt but that those two girls who were wailing on the road knew well enough <<target>> was the murderer , but no one would tell in this accursed , unhallowed , godless country .::::who
The honour and honesty of one man did not , <<target>> these days , prompt another to abstain from vice .::::in
The only heroism left in the country was the heroism <<target>> mystery , of secret bloodshed and of hidden attacks .::::of
He had driven back methodically to Carnlough gates , but <<target>> hesitated to carry his burden up to the hall-door .::::he
Would it not be better for him at once to go home , <<target>> there to endure the suffering that was in store for him ?::::and
But he remembered that it would behove him to take <<target>> steps might be possible for tracing the murderer .::::what
That by no steps could anything be done , he <<target>> sure ; but still the attempt was necessary .::::was
He had , however , paused a minute or two <<target>> the open gate when he was rebuked by Peter .::::at
`` Shure yer honour is going up to the house <<target>> get the constables to scour the counthry . ''::::to
`` Scour the <<target>> ! ''::::country
`` All the country will turn out to <<target>> the murderer of my boy . ''::::defend
said Mr. Blake , as he looked <<target>> the car and its occupant .::::at
The poor boy 's head was supported on the pillow behind <<target>> driver 's seat , on which no one sat .::::the
`` You know where they have cut the road <<target>> where your property meres with Bodkin 's .::::just
There was a man above there <<target>> had loop-holed the wall .::::who
I saw his face wearing a mask <<target>> plain as I can see yours .::::as
And he had <<target>> double-barrelled gun .::::a
He fired the two shots , and my <<target>> was killed by the first . ''::::boy
`` They have struck you too on <<target>> collar of your coat . ''::::the
`` I got into the field with the murderer , and <<target>> could have caught the man had I been younger .::::i
But what would have <<target>> the use ?::::been
No jury would have <<target>> him guilty .::::found
What am I <<target>> do ?::::to
what am I <<target>> do ? ''::::to
Mrs. Blake and her daughter were now out upon the <<target>> , and were filling the hall with their wailings .::::steps
`` Tell me , Blake , <<target>> had I better do ? ''::::what
Then Mr. Blake decided that the body should remain there that night , and Mr. Jones also , and <<target>> the police should be sent for to do whatever might seem fitting to the policemen 's mind .::::that
Peter was sent off to Morony Castle with such a letter as <<target>> Blake was able to write to the two Jones girls .::::miss
The police came from Tuam , but the result of <<target>> enquiries on that night need not be told here .::::their
There was a feeling very general in the county that the murder had been committed by the man named Lax , who was known to have been <<target>> the neighbourhood lately , and was declared by his friends at Headford to be now in Galway , waiting for the trial of Pat Carroll .::::in
But there seemed to be a feeling about the <<target>> that Florian Jones had deserved his fate .::::country
He had given a solemn promise to Father Brosnan , -- of <<target>> nature was not generally known , -- and had broken it .::::what
`` The bittherness of the Orange feud was <<target>> his blood , '' said Father Brosnan .::::in
But the idea was common about Tuam and Headford that Pat Carroll was a martyr , and that <<target>> had been persuaded to turn Protestant in order that he might give false evidence against him .::::florian
The reader , however , must understand that Florian still professed the Catholic religion at the moment of his <<target>> , and that all Headford was aware that Pat Carroll had broken the sluice gate at Ballintubber .::::death
After an interval of two days the trial was about <<target>> go on at Galway in spite of the murder .::::to
It was quite true that by nothing could the <<target>> of life be restored to Florian Jones .::::breath
His evidence , such as it was , <<target>> now be taken only from his deposition .::::could
And such evidence was regarded as being very unfair <<target>> on one side and on the other .::::both
As given against Pat Carroll it was regarded as <<target>> , as being incapable of subjection to cross-examination .::::unfair
The boy 's evidence had been extracted from him by his parents and by Captain Yorke Clayton , in opposition to the statements which had <<target>> made scores of times by himself on the other side , and which , if true , would all tend to exonerate the prisoner .::::been
It had been the intention of Mr. O'Donnell , the senior counsel employed to defend Carroll , <<target>> insist , with the greatest severity , on the lies told by the poor boy .::::to
It was this treatment which <<target>> had especially feared .::::florian
There could be no such treatment now ; but Mr. O'Donnell would know well how to insist on <<target>> injustice of the deposition , in which no allusion would be made to the falsehood previously told .::::the
But on the other side it was said that the witness <<target>> been removed so that his evidence should not be given .::::had
They must now depend solely on the statement of Terry Carroll , Pat 's <<target>> , and who also had lied terribly before he told the truth .::::brother
And he , too , was condemned more bitterly , even by Mr. Jones and his friends , in <<target>> he was giving evidence against his brother , than had he continued to lie on his behalf .::::that
The circumstances being such as they were , it was felt to be almost <<target>> to secure the conviction of Pat Carroll for the offence he had committed .::::impossible
And yet there were certainly a dozen persons who had seen that offence committed in the light <<target>> day , and many other dozens who knew by whom the offence had been committed .::::of
And , indeed , the feeling had become common through the country that all the lawyers and judges in Ireland , -- the lawyers and judges that <<target>> who were opposed to the Landleague , -- could not secure a conviction of any kind against prisoners whom the Landleague was bound to support .::::is
It had come to be whispered about , that there were men in the County of Galway , -- and men also in other counties , -- too strong for the Government , men who could <<target>> the Government on any point , men whom no jury could be brought to convict by any evidence ; men who boasted of the possession of certain secret powers , -- which generally meant murder .::::beat
It came to be believed that these men were possessed of certain mysterious <<target>> which the police could not handle , nor the magistrates touch .::::capabilities
And the danger to be feared from these men arose <<target>> from the belief in them which had become common .::::chiefly
The man living next to you , ignorant , and a Roman Catholic , inspired with some <<target>> awe , would wish in his heart that the country was rid of such fire-brands .::::mysterious
But murder and misrule had so raised their heads for the present as <<target>> make themselves appear to him more powerful than law and order .::::to
Mr. Lax , and others like him , were keenly alive <<target>> the necessity of maintaining this belief in their mysterious power .::::to
The trial came on , having been delayed two <<target>> by the murder of poor Florian Jones .::::days
His body had , in the meantime , been taken home , <<target>> the only visitor received at Morony Castle had been Yorke Clayton .::::and
The girls had known that it was so , but <<target>> of them had said a word to rebuke him .::::neither
`` Who was <<target>> ? ''::::it
Clayton shook his head <<target>> ground his teeth .::::and
`` Do you know , <<target>> have you an idea ?::::or
You know so much about the <<target>> , '' said Edith .::::country
`` To you two , but to <<target>> only , I do know .::::you
He and I can <<target>> exist together .::::not
The man 's name <<target>> Lax . ''::::is
It may be imagined that the trial was not commenced at Galway without the <<target>> of much sympathy for Mr. Jones and the family at Morony Castle .::::expression
It is hard to explain the different feelings which existed , feelings exactly opposed to <<target>> other , but which still were both in their way general and true .::::each
He was `` poor Mr. Jones , '' who had lost his son , and , worse still , his eighty acres of grass , and he was <<target>> `` that fellow Jones , '' that enemy to the Landleague , whom it behoved all patriotic Irishmen to get the better of and to conquer .::::also
It was understood that the boy was to be buried at Headford , on Saturday , the <<target>> ; but , nevertheless , the father was in the assize town on the Friday .::::3rd
To the right of the judge sat the twelve jurors who had been summoned to try the case , and to <<target>> left was the grand jurors ' box , in which Mr. Jones took his seat early in the day .::::the
And Frank was also in the court , and had been stopped by <<target>> one when he accompanied his father into the grand jurors ' box .::::no
But the court was crowded in a wonderful manner , so that they who <<target>> the ways of criminal courts in Ireland knew that something special was boded .::::understood
As soon as Mr. Justice Parry took his seat , it was seen that the court was much more <<target>> ordinarily filled , and was filled by men who did not make themselves amenable to the police .::::than
Many were the instructions given by the judge who had <<target>> selected with a special view to this trial .::::been
Judge Parry was a Roman Catholic , who had sat in the House of Commons as a strong <<target>> , had been Attorney-General to a Liberal Government , and had been suspected of holding Home-Rule sentiments .::::liberal
There had been many Judge Parrys in Ireland , who have all gone the same <<target>> , and have followed the same course when they have accepted the ermine .::::gait
But a judge is <<target>> at liberty .::::not
He now gave special instructions to the officers of <<target>> court to keep quiet and to preserve order .::::the
But the court was full , densely crowded ; and the noise which arose <<target>> the crowd was only the noise as of people whispering loudly among themselves .::::from
The jury was quickly sworn and <<target>> trial was set on foot .::::the
Pat Carroll was made to stand up in the dock , and Mr. Jones looked at the face of the <<target>> who had been the first on his property to show his hostility to the idea of paying rent .::::man
He and Lax had been great friends , and it was known that Lax had sworn that <<target>> a short time not a shilling of rent should be paid in the County Mayo .::::in
From that assurance all <<target>> troubles had come .::::these
Then the Attorney-General opened the case , and to tell the truth , <<target>> made a speech which though very eloquent , was longer than necessary .::::he
He spoke of the dreadful state of the country , a matter which he might have left to the judge , and <<target>> burst into tears when he alluded to the condition of Mr. Jones , the gentleman who sat opposite to him .::::almost
And he spoke at full length of the evidence of the poor boy whose deposition he held in <<target>> hand , which he told the jury he would read to them later on in the day .::::his
No doubt the lad had deceived his <<target>> since the offence had been committed .::::father
He had long declared that he <<target>> nothing of the perpetrators .::::knew
His lordship would instruct them how far the boy 's deposition could <<target>> accepted as evidence , and how far it must fail .::::be
And so at last the Attorney-General brought <<target>> eloquent speech to an end .::::his
And now there arose a murmuring sound in the court , and a stirring of <<target>> and a moving of shoulders , louder than that which had been heard before .::::feet
The judge , there on his bench , looking out from under his bushy <<target>> , could see that the people before him were all of one class .::::eyebrows
And he could see also that the half-dozen policemen who were kept close among the <<target>> , were so pressed as to be hardly masters of their own actions .::::crowd
He called out a word even from the bench in which there was something as to clearing <<target>> court ; but no attempt to clear the court was made or was apparently possible .::::the
The first witness was summoned , and an attempt was made <<target>> bring him up through the dock into the witness-box .::::to
This witness was Terry Carroll , the brother of Pat , and was <<target>> to be there that he might swear away his brother 's liberty .::::known
There were two policemen standing between the two brothers , but <<target>> only turned round and looked at the traitor with scorn .::::pat
But the voices through the court sounded louder and more venomous as Terry Carroll stepped out of <<target>> dock among the policemen who were to make an avenue for him up to the witness-box .::::the
It was the last <<target>> he ever made .::::step
At that moment the flash of a pistol was seen in the court ; of a <<target>> close at the man 's ear , and Terry Carroll was a dead man .::::pistol
In this way was the other witness removed , who had been brought thither by <<target>> Crown to give evidence as to the demolition of Mr. Jones 's flood gates .::::the
And it was said afterwards , -- for weeks afterwards , -- that such should be the fate <<target>> all witnesses who appeared in the west of Ireland to obey the behests of the Crown .::::of
Clayton , who had been sitting at the end of the row of barristers , jumped up over the back of the bench and rushed in <<target>> the people , who now tried simply to hold their own places , and appeared neither to be anxious to go in or out .::::among
`` Tear an ' ages , Musther Clayton , what are <<target>> after jumping on to a fellow that way . ''::::you
This was said by a brawny Miletian , on to whose shoulders <<target>> friend had leaped , meaning to get down among the crowd .::::our
But the Miletian had struck him hard , and would have knocked him <<target>> had there been room enough for him on which to fall .::::down
But Clayton had minded the blow not at all , and had minded the judge as <<target>> , making his way in through the crowd over the dead body of Terry Carroll .::::little
He had been aware that Lax was in the court , and <<target>> seated himself opposite to the place where the man had stood .::::had
But Lax had moved himself during the Attorney-General 's speech , either with the view of avoiding the Captain 's eyes , -- <<target>> , if he were to be the murderer , of finding the best place from which the deed could be done .::::or
If this had been his object , <<target>> the place had been well selected .::::certainly
It was afterwards stated , that though fifty people at the judge 's end of the court <<target>> seen the pistol , no eyes had seen the face of him who held it .::::had
Many faces had been seen , but nobody <<target>> connect a single face with the pistol .::::could
And it was proved also that the ball had entered the head just under the ear , with a <<target>> upwards towards the brain , as though the weapon had been used by someone crouching towards the ground .::::slant
Clayton made his way out of court , followed by the faithful <<target>> , and was soon surrounded by half a score of policemen .::::hunter
Hunter was left to watch the door of the court , because he was well acquainted <<target>> Lax , and because should Lax come across Hunter , `` God help Mr .::::with
And others were sent by twos and threes through the city to catch <<target>> man if it were possible , or to obtain tidings respecting him .::::this
`` A man can not bury himself under the ground , '' said Clayton ; `` <<target>> have always this pull upon them , that they can not make themselves invisible . ''::::we
But in this case it almost did <<target>> that Mr. Lax had the power .::::appear
Though Pat Carroll was not at once set at <<target>> , his trial was brought to an end .::::liberty
It was felt to be impossible to send the case to the jury <<target>> the only two witnesses belonging to the Crown had been murdered .::::when
The prisoner was remanded , or sent back to gaol , so that the Crown might look for more <<target>> if more might chance to be found , and everybody else connected in the matter was sent home .::::evidence
A dark gloom settled itself on Galway , and men were heard to <<target>> among themselves that the Queen 's laws were no longer in force .::::whisper
And there was a rowdy readiness to oppose all force , the force <<target>> the police for instance , and the force of the military .::::of
There were men there who seemed to think that now had come the <<target>> time when they might knock anyone on the head at their leisure .::::good
It did not come quite to this , as the police <<target>> still combined , and their enemies were not so .::::were
But such men as Captain Clayton began to look <<target>> though they doubted what would become of it .::::as
`` If he thinks he is big enough to catch a hold of Terry <<target>> and keep him , he 'll precious soon find his mistake . ''::::lax
This was said by Con <<target>> of Captain Clayton .::::heffernan
Frank Jones had travelled backwards and forwards between Morony Castle and the North more than once since these things were doing , <<target>> had met the new member for Cavan together with Rachel on the very evening on which poor Florian had been murdered .::::and
It was not till the next morning <<target>> the news had become generally known .::::that
`` Are you fetching all these people down from here <<target>> do the work the men there ought to do ?::::to
How are the men there <<target>> get their wages ? ''::::to
`` That is the essence of <<target>> , '' said Frank .::::boycotting
`` The men there wo n't get their wages , and can only <<target>> by robbing the governor and men like him of their rents .::::live
And in that way they <<target>> n't live long .::::ca
Everything will be disturbed <<target>> ruined . ''::::and
`` It seems to me , '' said Rachel , `` <<target>> the whole country is coming to an end . ''::::that
`` Your father is Member of Parliament now , and <<target>> course he will set it all to rights . ''::::of
`` He will at any rate do his best to do so , '' <<target>> Rachel , `` and will rob no man in the doing it .::::said

`` And your <<target>> ? ''::::sisters
`` They are of the same way <<target>> thinking , I take it .::::of
They are not good at inventing any way of getting out <<target>> their troubles ; but they know how to endure . ''::::of
`` Now , Frank , '' said she , `` <<target>> I give you a bit of advice ? ''::::shall
`` You wanted to kiss <<target>> just now . ''::::me
`` That was natural <<target>> any rate . ''::::at
When a young man and a young woman <<target>> two they should n't kiss any more .::::are

`` Certainly it <<target>> . ''::::is
`` And if the wife earns it instead of <<target>> husband ; -- is n't that honest ?::::the
And then you know , '' she said , looking up <<target>> his face , `` you can kiss me right away .::::into
Is n't that <<target>> inducement ? ''::::an
The offer was an inducement , but <<target>> conversation only ended in a squabble .::::the
She rebuked him for his dishonesty , in taking the kiss without acceding to the penalty , and he declared that <<target>> to his view of the case , he could not become the fainÃ©ant husband of a rich opera singer .::::according
`` And yet you would ask me to <<target>> the fainÃ©ante wife of a wealthy landowner .::::become
And because , under the stress of the times , you are not wealthy <<target>> choose to reject the girl altogether who has given you her heart .::::you

`` What will Mr. Parnell do <<target>> such a follower ? ''::::with
`` Mr. Parnell is also an honest <<target>> , '' cried Mr. O'Mahony .::::man
`` Two honest men looking for <<target>> together will never fall out .::::light

But Rachel had enough left of Lord Castlewell 's money to carry them back to London , on condition that <<target>> did not stop on the road , and to this condition she was forced to bring her father .::::they
Early on the following morning before they started the <<target>> reached Cavan of poor Florian 's death .::::news
exclaimed Frank ; but it was <<target>> that he did say .::::all
He was a man who like his father had <<target>> embittered by the circumstances of the times .::::become
Mr. Jones had bought his property , now thirty years <<target>> , with what was then called a parliamentary title .::::since
He had paid hard money for it , and had induced his friends to <<target>> their money to assist the purchase , for which he was responsible .::::lend
Now there had come forth a law , not from the hand of the Landleaguers , but from the <<target>> , who , it was believed , would protect those who did their duty by the country .::::government
Under this law commissioners were to be appointed , -- or sub-commissioners , -- men supposed to be not <<target>> great mark in the country , who were to reduce the rent according to their ideas of justice .::::of
If a man paid ten pounds , -- or had engaged to pay ten , -- <<target>> him take his pen and write down seven or eight as the sub-commissioner should decide .::::let
As the outside landlords , the friends of Mr. Jones , must have five pounds out of <<target>> original ten , that which was coming to Mr. Jones himself would be about halved .::::the
And the condition of Mr. Jones , under the system of <<target>> which he was undergoing , was hard to endure .::::boycotting
Now Frank was the eldest son , and the property <<target>> Castle Morony and Ballintubber was entailed upon him .::::of
He was brought up in his early youth to feel that he was to <<target>> that situation , which , of all others , is the most attractive .::::fill
He was to have been the eldest <<target>> of a man of unembarrassed property .::::son

It is not to be wondered <<target>> that he was embittered .::::at
He had been spending some hours of the last day in reading the clauses of the <<target>> under which the sub-commissioners were to show him what mercy they might think right .::::bill
As he left Cavan the following morning , his curses <<target>> more deep against the Government than against the Landleague .::::were
Mr. O'Mahony and his daughter got back to Cecil <<target>> in September in a very impecunious state .::::street
He soon began to understand that the position of Member of <<target>> was more difficult and dangerous than that of a lecturer .::::parliament
The police had interfered with him ; but the police had in truth <<target>> him no harm , nor had they wanted anything from him .::::done
But as Member of Parliament for Cavan the <<target>> made on his purse were very numerous .::::attacks
And throughout September , when the glory of Parliament was just newly settled upon his <<target>> , sundry calls were made upon him for obedience which were distasteful to him .::::shoulders
He was wanted <<target>> in Ireland .::::over
Mr. O'Mahony was an outspoken , frank man , who <<target>> not at all like to be troubled with secrets .::::did
`` I have n't got any money to <<target>> over to Ireland just at present .::::come

It was thus he wrote to some brother Member of Parliament <<target>> had summoned him to a grand meeting at the Rotunda .::::who
He was wanted to address the people on the <<target>> of the principle of paying no rent .::::honesty
`` For the matter of that , '' he wrote to <<target>> brother member , `` I do n't see the honesty .::::another

Bill would sell it and spend the money , and <<target>> good would then have been done to the country .::::no
I should have to argue the matter out with you or someone <<target>> before I could speak about it at the Rotunda . ''::::else
He settled himself down in Cecil Street and <<target>> to write a book about rent .::::began
When he began his book he <<target>> rent from his very soul .::::hated
The difficulty he saw was this : what should you do <<target>> the property when you took it away from the landlords ?::::with
He quite saw his way to taking it away ; if only a new order would come from heaven for the creation of a special set of <<target>> who should be wedded to their land by some celestial matrimony , and should clearly be in possession of it without the perpetration of any injustice .::::farmers
He did not quite see his way to this by his <<target>> lights , and therefore he went to the British Museum .::::own
When a man wants to write a book full of <<target>> facts , he always goes to the British Museum .::::unassailable
In this way Mr. O'Mahony purposed to spend his autumn instead of speaking at the <<target>> , because it suited him to live in London rather than in Dublin .::::rotunda
Cecil Street in September is not the <<target>> cheerful place in the world .::::most
While Rachel had been singing at `` The Embankment , '' with the occasional excitement of a quarrel with Mr. Moss , it had been all <<target>> well ; but now while her father was studying statistics at the British Museum , she had nothing to do but to practise her singing .::::very
`` I mean to do something , you know , <<target>> earning that Â£200 which you have lent me . ''::::towards
This she said to Lord Castlewell , who had come <<target>> to London to have his teeth looked after .::::up
This was the excuse he gave for <<target>> in London at this unfashionable season .::::being
`` I have to sing from breakfast to dinner without stopping one <<target>> , so you may go back to the dentist at once .::::minute
I have n't time even to <<target>> what he has done . ''::::see
`` I have to propose that you and your father <<target>> come and dine with me down at Richmond to-day .::::shall

But you must dine somewhere , and <<target>> say you will come . ''::::do
But Rachel was determined not to come , -- at any rate <<target>> to say that she would come without consulting her father .::::not
So she explained that the Member of Parliament was hard at work at the British Museum , writing <<target>> book against the payment of rents , and that she could not go without consulting him .::::a
But Lord Castlewell made <<target>> very easy .::::that
`` I 'll go and see , '' said he , `` how a man looks when he is <<target>> a book on such a subject ; and I 'll be back and tell you all about it .::::writing

`` There wo n't be any trouble about <<target>> , because she lives at Richmond .::::her
Then he started off , and came back in half an hour , saying <<target>> Mr. O'Mahony had expressed himself quite satisfied to do as he was told .::::that
`` The deceit of the world , the flesh , and the devil , get the better <<target>> one on every side , '' said Rachel , when she was left to herself .::::of
`` Who would have thought of the noble lord spinning off <<target>> the British Museum on such an errand as that !::::to
But he will give papa a good dinner , <<target>> I sha n't be any the worse .::::and
A man must be very bad before he can do a woman <<target>> injury if she is determined not to be injured . ''::::an
The conversation consisted of quizzing Mr. O'Mahony about his book , as to <<target>> he was already beginning to be a little out of heart .::::which
But he bore the quizzing well , and was thoroughly good-humoured as he <<target>> the lord and his daughter sitting on the front seat before him .::::saw
The Speaker has never turned me out of the House <<target>> Commons , only because I have never sat there .::::of
Your character will be <<target>> for ever . ''::::lost
Lord Castlewell declared that his character would be made for ever , as he <<target>> the great prima donna of the next season at his left hand .::::had
The dinner went <<target>> very pleasantly .::::off
Old Mrs. Peacock declared that she had never known a prima <<target>> before to be the daughter of a Member of Parliament .::::donna
She felt that great honour <<target>> done to the profession .::::was
`` Why , '' said Lord Castlewell , `` he is writing <<target>> book to prove that nobody should pay any rent ! ''::::a
said Mrs. Peacock , `` <<target>> would be terrible .::::that

`` And yet you want houses to <<target>> in , '' said Lord Castlewell .::::live
When they were in the middle of their dinners they were <<target>> surprised by the approach of Mr. Mahomet M. Moss .::::all
He was dressed up to a degree of beauty <<target>> Rachel thought that she had never seen equalled .::::which
His shirt-front was full <<target>> little worked holes .::::of
His studs were gold and turquoise , and those at <<target>> wrists were double studs , also gold and turquoise .::::his
The tie of his cravat was <<target>> thing marvellous to behold .::::a
His waistcoat was new for the occasion , <<target>> apparently all over marvellously fine needlework .::::and
It might , all the same , <<target>> been done by a sewing-machine .::::have
The breadth of the satin lappets <<target>> his dress-coat were most expansive .::::of
And his hair must have taken two <<target>> the whole afternoon to accomplish .::::artists
It was evident to see that he felt himself to be quite <<target>> lord 's equal by the strength of his personal adornment .::::the
`` Well , yes , '' he said , `` I have brought Madame Tacchi down <<target>> to show her what we can do in the way of a suburban dinner .::::here
Madame Tacchi is about to take the place which <<target>> O'Mahony has vacated at 'The Embankment . '::::miss
Ah , my lord , you behaved <<target>> shabbily to us there . ''::::very
`` If Madame Tacchi , '' said the lord , `` can sing <<target>> all like Miss O'Mahony , we shall have her away very soon .::::at
Is Madame Tacchi in sight , so <<target>> I can see her ? ''::::that
Then Mr. Moss indicated the table at which the lady <<target>> , and with the lady was Madame Socani .::::sat
`` They are a bad lot , '' said <<target>> Castlewell , as soon as Moss had withdrawn .::::lord
`` I know them , and they are a bad <<target>> , particularly that woman who is with them .::::lot
It is a marvel to me <<target>> you got among them . ''::::how
Lord Castlewell had now become very intimate with the O'Mahonys ; and <<target>> what he said showed also his intimacy with Mrs. Peacock .::::by
`` There can be good <<target>> and bad Americans .::::americans
You do n't mean to say that you think <<target>> of an American than of an Englishman . ''::::worse
`` I think higher of an Englishman than <<target>> an American , and lower also .::::of
I suppose that the manager of a <<target>> ought to be a gentleman . ''::::theatre
`` I do n't quite understand it <<target>> , '' said Mrs. Peacock .::::all
`` Father does fly so very high in <<target>> air when he talks about people . ''::::the
The household at Castle Morony was very <<target>> for some time after the trial .::::sad
They had hardly begun to feel the death of Florian <<target>> the excitement existed as they felt it afterwards .::::while
Mr. Jones , his father , seemed to regard the <<target>> boy as though he had been his favourite child .::::lost
It was not many months since he had refused to allow him to eat in his presence , and had <<target>> persuaded by such a stranger as was Captain Clayton , to treat him with some show of affection .::::been
When he had driven him into Ballyglunin , he had <<target>> stern and harsh to him to the very last .::::been
And now he was obliterated with sorrow because <<target>> had been robbed of his Florian .::::he
The two girls had sorrows of their own ; though neither of them <<target>> permit her sorrow to create any quarrel between her and her sister .::::would
It was understood that he had <<target>> separated himself from Rachel O'Mahony .::::altogether
The cause of his separation <<target>> singular in its nature .::::was
It was now November , and Rachel had already <<target>> a singularly rapid success at Covent Garden .::::achieved
She still lived in Cecil Street , <<target>> there was no lack of money .::::but
Indeed , her name had risen into such repute that some Irish people began to think that <<target>> father was the proper man for Cavan , simply because she was a great singer .::::her
It can not be said , however , that this was the case among the men who <<target>> regarded as the leaders of the party , as they still doubted O'Mahony 's obedience .::::were
But money at any rate poured into Rachel 's lap , and <<target>> the money that which was quite as objectionable to poor Frank .::::with
He had begun by asserting that he did not wish to live idle on the earnings of a singer ; <<target>> , therefore , as the singer had said , `` he and she were obliged to be two . ''::::and
She was very anxious to be true to her lover ; but she <<target>> not like living without some lover to whom she might be true .::::did
`` You see , as I am <<target>> I am exposed to the Mosses .::::placed
I do want to have a <<target>> to protect me . ''::::husband
Then a lover <<target>> come forward .::::had
Lord Castlewell had absolutely professed to make <<target>> the future Marchioness of Beaulieu .::::her
Of this there must be more hereafter ; but Frank <<target>> of it , and tore his hair in despair .::::heard
And there was another <<target>> at Castle Morony .::::misery
It reached Mr. Jones 's ears that <<target>> was anxious to give warning .::::peter
It certainly was the case that Peter was of great use to them , and that Mr. <<target>> had rebuked him more than once as having made a great favour of his services .::::jones
The fact was that Peter , if discharged , would hardly know where to <<target>> for another place where he could be equally at home and equally comfortable .::::look
And he was treated by the family generally with <<target>> that confidence which his faithfulness seemed to deserve .::::all
But he was nervous and ill at ease under his master 's rebukes ; and at last there came an <<target>> which seemed to harrow up his own soul , and instigated him to run away from County Galway altogether .::::event
`` Miss Edith , Miss Edith , '' he said , `` come in <<target>> , thin , and see what I have got to show you . ''::::here
Then , with an air of great mystery , <<target>> drew his young mistress into the pantry .::::he
`` Look at <<target>> now !::::that
Was ever the like of that seen <<target>> the mortial world began ? ''::::since
Then he took out from a dirty envelope a dirty <<target>> of paper , and exposed it to her eyes .::::sheet
On the top of it <<target>> a rude coffin .::::was
`` Do n't it make yer hair stand on end , and yer very flesh <<target>> , Miss Edith , to look at the likes o ' that ! ''::::creep
And below the coffin there was <<target>> ruder skull and two cross-bones .::::a
`` Them 's intended for <<target>> I 'm to be .::::what
I understand their <<target>> well enough .::::language
Look here , '' and he turned the envelope round and showed <<target>> it was addressed to Peter McGrew , butler , Morony Castle .::::that
`` They know me well enough <<target>> the country round . ''::::all
The letter was <<target>> follows :::::as
If you 're not out of that before the end of the month , <<target>> stay there doing things for them infernal blackguards , your goose is cooked .::::but
So now you know <<target>> about it .::::all
Edith attempted to laugh at this letter , but Peter <<target>> her understand that it was no laughing matter .::::made
`` I 've a married darter in Dublin who wo n't see <<target>> father shot down that way if she knows it . ''::::her
But this Peter declined to do on the spur of the moment , <<target>> to be equally afraid of his master and of Captain Moonlight .::::seeming
The Captain was <<target>> Captain Clayton .::::always
`` He is coming here to-morrow , and I <<target>> show him the letter , '' said Edith .::::will
But she did not on that account <<target>> to tell her father at once .::::scruple
This was the third visit that the Captain had paid to <<target>> Castle since the terrible events of the late trial .::::morony
And it must be understood that he had not spoken a word to either of the two girls since the moment <<target>> which he had ventured to squeeze Edith 's hand with a tighter grasp than he had given to her sister .::::in
They , between them , had discussed him and his character <<target>> ; but had come to no understanding respecting him .::::often
Ada had declared that Edith should be his , and had in some <<target>> recovered from the paroxysm of sorrow which had first oppressed her .::::degree
But Edith had refused altogether to look <<target>> the matter in that light .::::at
`` It was quite out of the question , '' she <<target>> , `` and so Captain Clayton would feel it .::::said
If you do n't hold your tongue , Ada , '' she <<target>> , `` I shall think you 're a brute . ''::::said
But Ada had not held her tongue , and had declared that if no one else were to know <<target>> -- no one but Edith and the Captain himself -- she would not be made miserable by it .::::it
`` What is <<target>> ? ''::::it
`` I thought him the best <<target>> he is the best .::::and
I thought that he thought that I was <<target>> best ; and I was n't .::::the
It shall be as <<target>> say . ''::::i
After this manner were the discussions held between them ; <<target>> of these Captain Clayton heard never a word .::::but
When he came he would seem to be full of <<target>> flood gates , and of Lax the murderer .::::the
He had two men with him <<target>> , Hunter and another .::::now
But no further attempt was made to <<target>> him in the neighbourhood of Headford .::::shoot
`` Lax finds it too hot , '' he said , `` since that <<target>> in the court house , and has gone away for the present .::::day
I nearly know where he is ; but there is no good catching him till I get some sort of evidence against him , and <<target>> I locked him up as a 'suspect , ' he would become a martyr and a hero in the eyes of the whole party .::::if
The worst of it is that though twenty men swore that they <<target>> seen it , no Galway jury would convict him . ''::::had
But nevertheless he was indefatigable in following <<target>> the murderer of poor Florian .::::up
`` As for the murder in the court house , '' he said , `` I do believe <<target>> though it was done in the presence of an immense crowd no one actually saw it .::::that
I have the pistol , <<target>> what is that ?::::but
The pistol was dropped on the <<target>> of the court house . ''::::floor
On this occasion Edith brought <<target>> poor Peter 's letter .::::him
As it happened they two <<target>> then alone together .::::were
But she had taught herself not to <<target>> any allusion to his love .::::expect
`` But he <<target>> been faithful .::::has
And you ca n't expect him to look <<target>> these things as you do . ''::::at
`` Of course he finds it <<target>> be a great compliment .::::to
To have a special letter addressed to him by some special Captain <<target>> is to bring him into the history of his country . ''::::moonlight
`` I suppose he <<target>> go . ''::::will
`` Then let <<target>> go .::::him
I would not on any <<target>> ask him to stay .::::account
If he comes to me I shall tell <<target>> simply that he is a fool .::::him
Pat Carroll 's people want to bother your father , and <<target>> would be bothered if he were to lose his man-servant .::::he
There is no <<target>> of that .::::doubt
If Peter desires to bother <<target>> let him go .::::him
Then he has another idea that he <<target>> to achieve a character for fidelity .::::wants
He must choose <<target>> the two .::::between
But I would n't on any account <<target>> him for a favour . ''::::ask
Then Edith having heard the Captain 's advice was preparing <<target>> leave the room when Captain Clayton stopped her .::::to
`` Well , <<target>> Clayton . ''::::captain
`` Some months ago , -- before these sad things had occurred , -- I told <<target>> what I thought of you , and I asked you for a favour . ''::::you
`` There was a mistake made between us all , -- <<target>> mistake which does not admit of being put to rights .::::a
It was unfortunate , but <<target>> misfortunes will occur .::::those
There is no more to <<target>> said about it . ''::::be
`` You and <<target>> . ''::::i
What right had he to tell <<target>> her happiness was in question ?::::that
The woman spoke , -- the essence of feminine self , <<target>> itself forward to defend feminine rights generally against male assumption .::::putting
Could any man be justified in asserting that a <<target>> loved him till she had told him so ?::::woman
It was true <<target>> least .::::at
As the word goes she worshipped <<target>> very ground he stood upon .::::the
She had been made to think and to feel that he <<target>> so by this mistake which had occurred between the three .::::was
She had known it before , but <<target>> was burned in upon her now .::::it
Yet he should not be <<target>> to assume it .::::allowed
And the one thing necessary for her peace of mind in <<target>> would be that she should do her duty by Ada .::::life
She had been <<target>> fool .::::the
She had instigated Ada to believe this <<target>> in which there was no truth .::::thing
The loss of all ecstasy of happiness must <<target>> the penalty which she would pay .::::be
And yet she <<target>> of him .::::thought
Must he pay a similar <<target>> for her blunder ?::::penalty
Surely this would <<target>> hard !::::be
Surely this would <<target>> cruel !::::be
But then she did not believe that man ever paid <<target>> penalty as that of which she was thinking .::::such
He would have the <<target>> of his life .::::work
It would be the work of her life to remember what <<target>> might have been had she not been a fool .::::she
`` If so , '' he said after a pause , `` then there is an end of it all , '' and he looked <<target>> her as though he absolutely believed her words , -- as though he had not known that her assertion had been mere feminine pretext !::::at
She could not endure that he at any rate should <<target>> know the sacrifice which she would have to make .::::not
But he was very <<target>> to her .::::hard
He would not even allow her the usual <<target>> of defending her sex by falsehood .::::right
`` If so there is an end of it all , '' he <<target>> , holding out his hand as though to bid her farewell .::::repeated
She believed him , and <<target>> him her hand .::::gave
`` Never again , '' he said to her very gruffly , but <<target>> with such a look across his eyes as irradiated his whole face .::::still
`` This hand shall never again be your own <<target>> do as you please with it . ''::::to
`` Who says <<target>> ? ''::::so
and she struggled as though to pull her hand away , but he held <<target>> as though in truth her hand had gone from her for ever .::::her
`` I say so , <<target>> am its legitimate owner .::::who
Now I bid you tell me the truth , or <<target>> I defy you to go on with the lie .::::rather
Do you not <<target>> me ? ''::::love
`` It is a question which <<target>> shall not answer . ''::::i
`` Then , '' said he , `` from <<target>> woman to a man it is answered .::::a
You can not make <<target>> over to another .::::me
I will not <<target>> transferred . ''::::be
`` I can do nothing with you , <<target>> Clayton , nor can you with me .::::captain
I know you are very <<target>> of course . ''::::strong
Then he loosened her hand , and as <<target>> did so Ada came into the room .::::he
`` I have asked her to be my wife , '' <<target>> the Captain , putting his hand upon Edith 's arm .::::said
`` I have nothing to <<target>> against it . ''::::say
`` I have much <<target>> say against it .::::to
We can all live without <<target>> married , I suppose .::::being
Captain Clayton has plenty to do <<target>> the trouble of a wife .::::without
And so have <<target>> and I .::::you
Could we leave <<target>> father ?::::our
And have we forgotten <<target>> soon poor Florian ?::::so
This is no <<target>> for marriages .::::time
Only think , papa would not have <<target>> means to get us decent clothes .::::the
As far as I am concerned , Captain Clayton , <<target>> there be an end of all this . ''::::let
Then she stalked out <<target>> the room .::::of
How could I <<target>> angry ? ''::::be
`` I have not time to <<target>> as other men do .::::do
I do not know that I ever said a word to her ; <<target>> yet , God knows , that I have loved her dearly enough .::::and
She is hot tempered now , and there are <<target>> in her heart which fight against me .::::feelings
You will say a word <<target>> my favour ? ''::::in
`` Indeed , indeed <<target>> will . ''::::i
`` There shall be nothing <<target>> between you and me .::::wrong
If she becomes my wife , <<target>> shall be my dearest sister .::::you

Poor Florian is <<target>> and gone .::::dead

And why should we not lead <<target>> as may best suit us ?::::them
I would be proud to marry your sister standing <<target>> she is now down in the kitchen .::::as
But if I did marry her I should have ample means <<target>> keep her as would become your father 's daughter . ''::::to
Then he took his leave <<target>> went back to Galway .::::and
It was explained in the last chapter that Frank Jones was not in <<target>> happy condition because of the success of the lady whom he loved .::::a
Rachel , as Christmas drew nigh , was more and more talked about in <<target>> , and became more and more the darling of all musical people .::::london
She had been twelve months now on the London boards , and had <<target>> justified the opinion expressed of her by Messrs. Moss and Le Gros .::::fully
There were those who declared that she sang as <<target>> woman of her age had ever sung before .::::no
And there had got abroad about her certain stories , which were true enough in the main , but <<target>> were all the more curious because of their truth ; and yet they were not true altogether .::::which
It was known that she was a daughter of a Landleaguing Member of Parliament , <<target>> that she had been engaged to marry the son of a boycotted landlord .::::and
Mr. Jones ' sorrows , and the death of his poor son , and the murder of the sinner who was to have been the witness at the <<target>> of his brother , were all known and commented on in the London press ; and so also was the peculiar vigour of Mr. O'Mahony 's politics .::::trial
Nothing , it was said , could be severed <<target>> entirely than were Mr. Jones and Mr. O'Mahony .::::more
The enmity was so deep that all ideas <<target>> marriage were out of the question .::::of
It was , no doubt , true that the gentleman was penniless and the lady rolling in wealth ; but <<target>> was a matter so grievous that so poor a thing as money could not be allowed to prevail .::::this
And then Mr. Moss was talked about as a dragon of iniquity , -- which , indeed , was true enough , -- and <<target>> represented as having caused contracts to be executed which would bind poor Rachel to himself , both as to voice and beauty .::::was
But Lord Castlewell had seen her , and had heard her ; and Mr. Moss , <<target>> all his abominations , was sent down to the bottom of the nethermost pit .::::with
The fortune of `` The Embankment '' was made by the number of visitors who were sent there to <<target>> and to hear this wicked fiend ; but it all redounded to the honour and glory of Rachel .::::see
There was something so peculiar in the connection which bound a violent <<target>> Member of Parliament with the prima donna of the day .::::landleaguing
They were father and daughter , but they looked more like husband and <<target>> , and it always seemed that Rachel had her own way .::::wife
Mr. O'Mahony had quite achieved a character for himself before the time had come <<target>> which he was enabled to open his mouth in the House of Commons .::::in
And some people went so far as to declare that he <<target>> about to be the new leader of the party .::::was
It certainly was true that about this time Lord <<target>> did make an offer to Rachel O'Mahony .::::castlewell
`` That I should have <<target>> to this ! ''::::come
she said to the lord when <<target>> lord had expressed his wishes .::::the
But that you should have seen it , -- that you should have come to understand that if I would be <<target>> wife I would sing every note out of my body , -- to do you good if it were possible .::::your
How have you been enlightened so far as to see that this <<target>> the way in which you may best make yourself happy ? ''::::is
Lord Castlewell did not quite like this ; but he knew that his wished-for bride was <<target>> unintelligible little person , to whom much must be yielded as to her own way .::::an
He had not given way to this idea before he had seen how <<target>> she had taken her place among the people with whom he lived .::::well
He was forty years old , and <<target>> was time that he should marry .::::it
He , however , would be of opinion that any bride whom his son might choose <<target>> be , by the very fact , raised to the top of the peerage .::::would
His mother was a religious woman , to whom <<target>> matrimony for her son would be an achievement .::::any
Now , of the proposed bride he <<target>> learned all manner of good things .::::had
She had come out of Mr. Moss 's furnace absolutely unscorched ; so much <<target>> as to scorn the idea of having been touched by the flames .::::unscorched
She was thankful to Lord Castlewell for what he had done , and <<target>> her thanks in a manner that was not grateful to him .::::expressed
She was not in the least put about or confused , or indeed surprised , because the heir of a marquis had made an <<target>> to her -- a singing girl ; but she let him understand that she quite thought that she had done a good thing .::::offer
`` It would be so much better for him than going on <<target>> he has gone , '' she said to her father .::::as
And Lord Castlewell knew very <<target>> what were her sentiments .::::well
It can not be said that <<target>> repented of his offer .::::he
Indeed he pressed her for an <<target>> more than once or twice .::::answer
But her conduct to him <<target>> certainly very aggravating .::::was
This matter of her marriage with an <<target>> was an affair of great moment .::::earl
Indeed all London was <<target>> with the subject .::::alive
But she had not time to give him an answer because it <<target>> necessary that she should study a part for the theatre .::::was
This was hard upon an earl , and was made <<target>> better by the fact that the earl was forty .::::no
You must give me a few <<target>> to think of it . ''::::days
This she said when he expressed a not <<target>> desire to give her a kiss .::::unnatural
But though she apparently made light of the matter to him , and astonished even her father <<target>> her treatment of him , yet she thought of it with a very anxious mind .::::by
She was quite alive to the glories of the position offered to <<target>> , and was not at all alive to its inconveniences .::::her
People would assert that she had caught the <<target>> who had intended her for other purposes .::::lover
`` That was of course out of the <<target>> , '' she said to herself .::::question
And she felt sure that she could make as <<target>> a countess as the best of them .::::good
With her father a Member of Parliament , and her husband <<target>> earl , she would have done very well with herself .::::an
She would have escaped from that brute Moss , and would have been subjected <<target>> less that was disagreeable in the encounter than might have been expected .::::to
It was thus in truth that <<target>> looked at the noble lord .::::she
`` There would be an end , '' she said , `` <<target>> for ever , of 'Love 's young dream . ' ''::::and
The dream had been <<target>> pleasant to her .::::very
She had thoroughly <<target>> her Frank .::::liked
He was handsome , fresh , full of passion , and <<target>> little violent when his temper lay in that direction .::::a
But he had been generous , and she was <<target>> of him that he had loved her thoroughly .::::sure
An answer was at any <<target>> due to Lord Castlewell .::::rate
But she made up her mind that before she could <<target>> the answer , she would write to Frank himself .::::give

`` It has been necessary that <<target>> should tell you myself .::::i
Now , I can not say whether , in <<target>> honour , that engagement has been dissolved . ''::::all
`` I thought there was no doubt <<target>> it , '' said the lord .::::about
`` It is as <<target>> tell you .::::i
I must write <<target>> Mr. Jones .::::to
Hearts can not be wrenched asunder <<target>> some effort in the wrenching .::::without

And I have not thought it quite honest to <<target>> lordship to do this without acquainting you . ''::::your
Then that interview was over , and <<target>> Castlewell went away no doubt disgusted .::::lord
He had not intended to be treated in this way by a <<target>> girl , when he proposed to make her his countess .::::singing
But with the disgust there was a <<target>> feeling of admiration for her conduct .::::strengthened
She looked much more like the countess than <<target>> singing girl when she spoke to him .::::the
And there certainly never came a time in which he could <<target>> her to go back and sing and marry Mr. Moss .::::tell
Therefore the few days necessary for an answer went <<target>> , and then she gave him her reply .::::by
`` My lord , '' she said , `` if <<target>> wish it still , it shall be so . ''::::you
`` I do wish it still , '' <<target>> said in a tone of renewed joy .::::he
`` Then you shall have <<target>> that you wish . ''::::all
Then there was a long embrace , but after <<target>> embrace she had a little speech to make .::::the
`` You ought to know , Lord Castlewell , how <<target>> I think of you and your high position .::::much
A man , they say , trusts much of <<target>> honour into the hands of his wife .::::his
Whatever you trust to me shall <<target>> guarded as my very soul .::::be
You shall be to me the one <<target>> whom I am bound to worship .::::man
I will worship you with all my heart , with all my <<target>> , with all my soul , and with all my strength .::::body

I only hope that an odd stray wish <<target>> mine may occasionally be yours . ''::::of
Then she smiled so sweetly that as she looked up into <<target>> face he was more enamoured of her than ever .::::his
But now we must go back for a moment , and read <<target>> correspondence which took place between Rachel O'Mahony and Frank Jones .::::the
Rachel 's letter <<target>> as follows :::::ran
I am afraid I must trouble you once again with my affairs ; though , <<target>> , after what last took place between us it ought not to be necessary .::::indeed
Lord Castlewell has proposed to make me his wife ; and , to tell you the truth , looking forward into the world , I do not <<target>> to throw over all its pleasures because your honour , whom I have loved , does not wish to accept the wages of a singing girl .::::wish
But the place is open to you still , -- <<target>> wages , and the singing girl , and all .::::the
Write me a line , and <<target>> how it is to be .::::say
Yours as you would <<target>> me to be ,::::have
This letter Frank Jones <<target>> to no one .::::showed
Had he allowed it to be seen by his sister Edith , she would probably have <<target>> him that no man ever received a sweeter love-letter from the girl whom he loved .::::told
`` The place is open to you still , -- <<target>> wages , the singing girl , and all . ''::::the
The girl had made nothing of this new and noble lover , except to assure his rival that he , the rival , should be <<target>> to him , the lover , if he , the lover , would write but one word to say that it should be so .::::postponed
But Frank was bad <<target>> reading such words .::::at
We are sinking lower <<target>> lower daily .::::and
My father is beginning to feel that we shall <<target>> see another rent day at Castle Morony .::::never
It is not fitting that I should think of joining my <<target>> fortunes to yours , which are soaring so high .::::fallen
And poor Florian <<target>> gone .::::is
We are at the present moment still <<target>> to the ground because of Florian .::::struck
I have long heard that <<target>> is your declared admirer .::::he
You have before you a glorious future , and <<target>> shall always hear with satisfaction of your career .::::i
Yours , with many <<target>> of the past ,::::memories
It was not a letter which would have put such a girl as Rachel O'Mahony into <<target>> heart unless she had in truth wished to get his agreement to her lordly marriage .::::good
`` This twice I have thrown myself at <<target>> head and he has rejected me . ''::::his
Then she abided Lord Castlewell 's coming , and <<target>> scene between them took place as above described .::::the
The marriage was at once <<target>> as a settled thing .::::declared
When June comes you sha n't find a <<target>> who will be in a greater hurry .::::girl
Do you think that I do not <<target>> to become a countess ? ''::::wish
He told her that he would <<target>> to get her engagement broken .::::contrive
`` Covent Garden is not going to quarrel with me about <<target>> wife , I 'm sure , '' he said .::::my

I , the future Countess of Castlewell ; I , the future Marchioness of <<target>> , will keep my terms and my allotted times like any candle-snuffer .::::beaulieu
What do you think <<target>> will say ? ''::::moss
Mr. Moss shall know that through it <<target>> I have done my duty .::::all
Madame Socani will tell lies , but she shall feel in her heart that she has once in her life come across <<target>> woman who , when she has signed a bit of paper , intends to remain true to the paper signed .::::a
And , my lord , there is still <<target>> due to you from my father . ''::::Â£100
`` I could pay it by a cheque on the bank , to <<target>> sure , but let us go on to the end of May .::::be
I want to see how all the young women <<target>> behave when they hear of it . ''::::will
And so some early day in <<target>> was fixed for the wedding .::::june
Among others who heard of it were , <<target>> course , Mr. Moss and Madame Socani .::::of
They heard of it , but <<target>> course did not believe it .::::of
It was too bright <<target>> be believed .::::to
`` As to that wicked old <<target>> , her father -- ''::::man
`` He 's not so very <<target>> , '' said Moss .::::old
That is , if <<target>> is her father .::::he
I have known that girl on the <<target>> any day these ten years . ''::::stage
`` No , you 've <<target>> ; not yet five .::::not
I do n't quite know <<target>> it is . ''::::how
And Mr. Moss endeavoured to think of it all in such a <<target>> as to make it yet possible that he might marry her .::::manner
What might not they two do <<target>> in the musical world ?::::together
`` You do n't mean to say <<target>> 'd take her yet ? ''::::you
`` When I take her you 'll be glad enough to join <<target>> ; that is , if we will have you . ''::::us
Then Madame Socani ground her teeth together , <<target>> turned up her nose with redoubled scorn .::::and
But it was soon borne in upon Mr. Moss that the marriage was <<target>> be a marriage , and he was in truth very angry .::::to
He had been able to endure M. Le Gros ' success <<target>> carrying away Miss O'Mahony from `` The Embankment . ''::::in
Miss O'Mahony might come back again <<target>> that or any other name .::::under
He -- and she -- had a musical future before them which <<target>> still be made to run in accordance with his wishes .::::might
Then he had learned with sincere sorrow that she was throwing <<target>> into the lord 's hands , borrowing money of him .::::herself
But there might be a way out of this which <<target>> still allow him to carry out his project .::::would
But now he heard that a real marriage <<target>> intended , and he was very angry .::::was
Not even Madame Socani was more capable of spite than Mr. <<target>> , though he was better able to hide his rage .::::moss
Even now , when Christmas-time had come , he would hardly believe the truth , and when the marriage was not instantly <<target>> out , new hopes came to him -- that Lord Castlewell would not at last make himself such a fool .::::carried
Three times a week the house was filled , and at last a fourth night <<target>> added , for which the salary paid to Rachel was very much increased .::::was
`` Oh , but , my <<target>> , it does matter ! ''::::lord
She always called him my lord now , with <<target>> little emphasis laid on the `` my . ''::::a
`` They have made father a Member of <<target>> , but he does not earn anything .::::parliament
What I can earn up to the last fatal day he shall <<target>> , if you will let me give it to him . ''::::have
They were very bright days for Rachel , because she had all <<target>> triumph of success , -- success gained by her own efforts .::::the
`` I can never do as much as this when I <<target>> your countess , '' she said to her future lord .::::am
`` I shall dwell in marble halls , as people say , but I shall never cram a house so full as to be able to see , when I look up from the <<target>> , that there is not a place for another man 's head ; and when my throat gave way the other day I could read all the disappointment in the public papers .::::stage
`` I hope <<target>> . ''::::so
`` And if you will love me I shall <<target>> very happy for long , long years . ''::::be
`` I will <<target>> you . ''::::love
`` But there will be no <<target>> of ecstasy such as this .::::passion
Father says that Home Rule wo n't be passed <<target>> the people will be thinking of my singing .::::because
Of course it is all vanity , but <<target>> is an enjoyment in it . ''::::there
But all this was <<target>> to Mr. Moss .::::wormwood
He had put out his hand so as to clutch this girl now two years <<target>> , understanding all her singing qualities , and then in truth loving her .::::since
She had taken a positive hatred to him , and <<target>> rejected him at every turn of her life .::::had
But he had not <<target>> all regarded that .::::at
He had managed to connect her with his theatre , and had perceived that her voice had <<target>> more and more sweet in its tones , and more and more rich in its melody .::::become
He had still hoped that he <<target>> make her his wife .::::would
Madame Socani 's abominable proposal had come from an assurance on her part that <<target>> could have all that he wished for without paying so dear for it .::::he
There had doubtless been some whispering between them over the matter , <<target>> the order for the proposal had not come from him .::::but
Madame Socani had judged of Rachel as <<target>> might have judged of herself .::::she
But all that had <<target>> to absolute failure .::::come
He felt now that he should be paying by <<target>> means too dear by marrying the girl .::::no
It would be a great triumph to marry her ; but he was <<target>> that this absurd earl wished to triumph in the same manner .::::told
Lord Castlewell had given her money , <<target>> had then failed in his object .::::and
Lord Castlewell had postponed the marriage because as the <<target>> drew nearer he would not sacrifice himself .::::moment
If the lady had a friend , it would be the friend 's duty <<target>> cudgel the lord , so villainous had been the noble lord 's conduct .::::to
But yet , in truth , who could have expected <<target>> the noble lord would have married the singing girl ?::::that
Was not his <<target>> known ?::::character
Did anybody in his senses expect that the <<target>> lord would marry Miss Rachel O'Mahony ?::::noble
`` If I have a friend , is my <<target>> to cudgel you , my lord ? ''::::friend
she said , clinging on to <<target>> arm in her usual manner .::::his
`` My friend is papa , who thinks that you are a very <<target>> fellow , considering your misfortune in being a lord at all .::::decent
There is nothing for it but to <<target>> them down with absolute silence . ''::::live
`` They are a nuisance , <<target>> we can do nothing . ''::::but
But Lord Castlewell did in truth <<target>> what was said about him .::::feel
Was he not going to pay <<target>> dearly for his whistle ?::::too
No doubt Rachel was all <<target>> she ought to be .::::that
She was honest , industrious , and high-spirited ; and , according to <<target>> thinking , she sang more divinely than any woman of her time .::::his
And he so thought of her that he knew that she <<target>> be his countess or be nothing at all to him .::::must
To think of her in any other <<target>> would be an abomination to him .::::light
But yet , was it worth his <<target>> to make her Marchioness of Beaulieu ?::::while
He could only get rid of his present engagement <<target>> some absolute change in his mode of life .::::by
For instance , he must shut himself up in a <<target>> and devote himself entirely to a religious life .::::castle
He must explain to her that circumstances would not admit his marrying , and must offer to <<target>> her any sum of money that she or her father might think fit to name .::::pay
If he wished to escape , this must be his way ; but as he looked at her when she came <<target>> the stage , where he always attended her , he assured himself that he did not wish to escape .::::off
Time went on <<target>> Parliament met .::::and
He was introduced by two brother Landleaguers , and <<target>> did take his place with some enthusiasm .::::really
He wanted to speak on the first day , <<target>> was judiciously kept silent by his colleagues .::::but
He expressed an idea that , until Ireland 's wrongs had been redressed , there ought not to be <<target>> moment devoted to any other subject , and became very violent in his expressions of this opinion .::::a
But he was not <<target>> kept dumb .::::long
Great things were expected from his powers of speech , and , though he had to be brought to silence <<target>> on three or four occasions , still , at last some power of speech was permitted to him .::::ignominiously
There were those among his own special brethren who greatly admired him and praised him ; but <<target>> others of the same class there was a shaking of the head and many doubts .::::with
Mr. O'Mahony , no doubt , could speak well <<target>> a debating society or a music hall .::::in
Words came from his <<target>> sweeter than honey .::::tongue
But just at the beginning of the session , the Speaker was bound to put a <<target>> even to Irish eloquence , and in this case was able to do so .::::limit
As Mr. O'Mahony contrived to get upon his feet very frequently , either in asking a question or in endeavouring to <<target>> on the answer given , there was something of a tussle between him and the authority in the chair .::::animadvert
It did not take much above a week to make the Speaker thoroughly tired of this new member , <<target>> threats were used towards him of a nature which his joint Milesian and American nature could not stand .::::and
He was told of dreadful things <<target>> could be done to him .::::which
Though as yet he could not be turned out of the House , for the state of the young <<target>> had not as yet admitted of that new mode of torture , still , he could be named .::::session
`` Let him <<target>> me .::::name
And Mr. O'Mahony was not a man who could be <<target>> when he was quarrelling with all around him .::::happy
He was soon worked into a violent passion , in which he made himself ridiculous , but when he <<target>> subsided , and the storm was past , he knew he had misbehaved , and was unhappy .::::had
And , as he was thoroughly honest , he could <<target>> be got to obey his leaders in everything .::::not
He wanted to abolish the Irish landlords , but he was desirous of abolishing them after some special <<target>> of his own , and could hardly be got to work efficiently in harness together with others .::::plan
`` Do n't you think your father is making an ass <<target>> himself , -- just a little , you know ? ''::::of
This was said by Lord Castlewell to Rachel when the session was <<target>> yet a fortnight old , and made Rachel very unhappy .::::not
And much as she liked music herself , dear as was her own profession to her , still she felt that , to be <<target>> Member of Parliament , and to have achieved the power of making speeches there , was better than to run after opera singers .::::a
She loved the man who was going to marry her very <<target>> , -- or rather , she intended to do so .::::well
He was not to her `` <<target>> 's young dream . ''::::love
But she intended that his lordship <<target>> become love 's old reality .::::should
She felt that this would not become the case , if love 's <<target>> reality were to tell her often that her father was an ass .::::old
Lord Castlewell 's father was , she <<target>> , making an ass of himself .::::thought
She saw no reason why he should be less <<target>> in his opinion as to her father .::::reticent
Of course he was older , and perhaps she did not <<target>> of that as much as she ought to have done .::::think
She ought also to have remembered that he was an earl , and she but a singing <<target>> , and that something was due to him for the honour he was doing her .::::girl
But of this she <<target>> take no account .::::would
She was to be his wife , and a <<target>> ought to be equal to the husband .::::wife
Such at least was her <<target>> view of the matter .::::american
In fact , her ideas on the matter ran as follows : My future husband is not entitled to call <<target>> father an ass because he is a lord , seeing that my father is a Member of Parliament .::::my
Nor is he entitled to call him so because he is an <<target>> , because the same thing is true of his own father .::::ass
And thus there came to <<target>> discord in her mind .::::be
`` I suppose all Parliament people make asses of <<target>> sometimes , Lords as well as Commons .::::themselves
I do n't see how a man is to go on talking for ever <<target>> laws and landleagues , and those sort of things without doing so .::::about
It is all <<target>> to me .::::bosh
And so I should think it must be to <<target>> , as you do n't do it .::::you
`` Why , my dear , there is not a <<target>> about London who is not laughing at him . ''::::man
`` I saw in _The Times_ the other day that he <<target>> considered a very true and a very honest man .::::is
Of course , they said that he talked nonsense sometimes ; but if you put <<target>> honesty against the nonsense , he will be as good as anybody else . ''::::the
`` I do n't think <<target>> understand , my dear .::::you
Honesty is not what <<target>> want . ''::::they
`` But what they do n't <<target>> especially is nonsense . ''::::want
But he does n't mean to consult <<target>> as to what they want .::::them
His idea is that if everybody can be got to <<target>> honest this question may be settled among them .::::be
But it must be talked about , and <<target>> , at any rate , is eloquent .::::he
I have heard it said that there was <<target>> a more eloquent man in New York .::::not
I think he has got as many <<target>> gifts as anyone else . ''::::good
In this way there <<target>> some bad feeling .::::rose
Lord Castlewell did think that there was something wanting in <<target>> manner in which he was treated by his bride .::::the
He was sure that he loved her , but he was sure also that <<target>> a lord marries a singing girl he ought to expect some special observance .::::when
And the fact that the singing girl 's father was a <<target>> of Parliament was much less to him than to her .::::member
He , indeed , would have been <<target>> to have the father abolished altogether .::::glad
But she had become very proud of her father <<target>> he had become a Member of Parliament .::::since
Her ideas of the British constitution were rather vague ; but she thought that a Member <<target>> Parliament was at least as good as a lord who was not a peer .::::of
He had his wealth ; but she was sure <<target>> he was too proud to think of that .::::that
Just at this period , when the session was beginning , <<target>> began to doubt the wisdom of what she was doing .::::rachel
He was nearly double her age , <<target>> she had determined to disregard that .::::but
He was plain , but <<target>> was of no moment .::::that
He had run after twenty different women , but she could condone all <<target>> , because he had come at last to run after her .::::that
For his wealth she cared nothing , -- or less than nothing , because by remaining single she could command wealth of her own ; -- wealth <<target>> she could control herself , and keep at her own banker 's , which she suspected would not be the case with Lord Castlewell 's money .::::which
But she had found the necessity of someone to lean upon when Frank Jones had told her that he would not marry her , and she <<target>> feared Mr. Moss so much that she had begun to think that he would , in truth , frighten her into doing some horrible thing .::::had
As Frank had deserted her , it would <<target>> better that she should marry somebody .::::be
Lord Castlewell had come , and she had felt <<target>> the fates were very good to her .::::that
`` By G -- -- , <<target>> 'll get him ! ''::::she
such had been the exclamation made with horror by Mr. Moss , <<target>> the echo of it had found its way to her ears .::::and
The more Mr. Moss was annoyed , the <<target>> ought to have been her delight .::::greater
But , -- but was <<target>> in truth delighted ?::::she
As she came to think of the reality she asked <<target>> what were the pleasures which were promised to her .::::herself
Did she not feel that a week spent with Frank Jones in some little cottage would be worth <<target>> twelvemonth of golden splendour in the `` Marble Halls '' which Lord Castlewell was supposed to own ?::::a
And why had <<target>> deserted her ?::::frank
Simply because he would not come <<target>> her and share her money .::::with
She acknowledged so much to <<target>> again and again .::::herself
And yet she was about to marry Lord Castlewell , simply because her doing <<target>> would be the severest possible blow to her old enemy , Mr. Moss .::::so
Then she asked herself what <<target>> be best for her .::::would
She had made for herself a great reputation , and she did <<target>> scruple to tell herself that this had come from her singing .::::not
A sort of prettiness did belong to her ; a <<target>> prettiness which had sufficed to catch Frank Jones .::::tiny
She had laughed about her prettiness and her littleness a score of <<target>> with Ada and Edith , and also with Frank himself .::::times
There had been the three girls who had called themselves `` Beauty <<target>> the Beast '' and the `` Small young woman . ''::::and
The reader will understand that it had not been Ada who had chosen <<target>> names ; but then Ada was not given to be witty .::::those
Her prettiness , such as it was , had <<target>> , and Frank had loved her dearly .::::sufficed
Then had come her great triumph , and she knew not only that <<target>> could sing , but that the world had recognised her singing .::::she
`` I am a great woman , as women <<target>> , '' she had said to herself .::::go
But her singing was to come to an end for <<target>> and ever on the 1st of May next .::::ever
She would be the Countess of Castlewell , and in <<target>> of time would be the Marchioness of Beaulieu .::::process
But she never again would <<target>> a great woman .::::be
She was selling all that <<target>> the marble halls .::::for
Was she wise in <<target>> she was doing ?::::what
She had lain awake one long morning <<target>> to answer the question for herself .::::striving
`` If nobody else should come , of course I should be an ugly old maid , '' she said to herself ; `` but <<target>> Frank might perhaps come again , -- Frank might come again , -- if Mr. Moss did not intervene in the meantime . ''::::then
But at last she acknowledged to herself that <<target>> had given the lord a promise .::::she
She would keep her promise , but she could <<target>> bring herself to exult at the prospect .::::not
She must take care , however , that <<target>> lord should not triumph over her .::::the
The lord had called <<target>> father an ass .::::her
She certainly would say a rough word or <<target>> if he abused her father again .::::two
This was the time of <<target>> `` suspects . ''::::the
Mr. O'Mahony had already taken an opportunity of expressing an opinion in the House of Commons that every honest man , every patriotic man , every generous man , every man in fact who was worth <<target>> salt , was in Ireland locked up as a `` suspect , '' and in saying so managed to utter very bitter words indeed respecting him who had the locking up of these gentlemen .::::his
Poor Mr. O'Mahony had no idea that he might have used with propriety as to this gentleman all the epithets of which he <<target>> the `` suspects '' to be worthy ; but instead of doing so he called him a `` disreputable jailer . ''::::believed
It is not pleasant to be called a disreputable jailer in the presence of all the best <<target>> one 's fellow citizens , but the man so called in this instance only smiled .::::of
Mr. O'Mahony had certainly made himself ridiculous , and the whole <<target>> were loud in their clamours at the words used .::::house
But that did <<target>> suffice .::::not
The Speaker reprimanded Mr. O'Mahony and desired him <<target>> recall the language and apologise for it .::::to
Then there arose a loud debate , during which the member of the Government who had been assailed declared that Mr. O'Mahony had not as yet been quite <<target>> enough in the House to learn the little details of Parliamentary language ; Mr. O'Mahony would no doubt soften down his eloquence in course of time .::::long
But the Speaker would not be content with this , and was about to order the sinner to be carried away by the Sergeant-at-Arms , when a friend on his <<target>> and a friend on his left , and a friend behind him , all whispered into his ear how easy it is to apologise in the House of Commons .::::right
`` You need n't say he is n't a disreputable jailer , but <<target>> call him a distasteful warder ; -- anything will do . ''::::only
This came from the gentleman at Mr. O'Mahony 's back , and <<target>> order for his immediate expulsion was ringing in his ears .::::the
He had been told that he was ridiculous , and could feel <<target>> it would be absurd to be carried somewhere into the dungeons .::::that
And the man whom he certainly detested at the present moment worse than any <<target>> scoundrel on the earth , had made a good-natured apology on his behalf .::::other
If he were carried away now , he could <<target>> come back again without a more serious apology .::::never
Then , farewell to all <<target>> of attacking the jailer .::::power
Then he looked round the House , showing <<target>> he thought that he had misbehaved himself .::::that
He had been driven to withdraw the true wrath of his eloquence from him `` at whose brow , '' as he told <<target>> the next morning , `` he had hurled his words with a force that had been found to be intolerable . ''::::rachel
Mr. O'Mahony had undoubtedly made himself an ass again on <<target>> second , third , and perhaps tenth occasion .::::this
This was not the ass he had made himself <<target>> the occasion to which Lord Castlewell had referred .::::on
But yet he was a thoroughly honest , patriotic man , desirous only <<target>> the good of his country , and wishing for nothing for himself .::::of
Is it not possible that as much may be said for others , who from day to day so violently excite our <<target>> , as to make us feel that special Irishmen selected for special constituencies are not worthy to be ranked with men ?::::spleen
You shall take the whole House of Commons , indifferent as to the side on which they sit , -- some six hundred and thirty out of the number , -- and will <<target>> in conversation that the nature of the animal , the absurdity , the selfishness , the absence of all good qualifies , are taken for granted as matters admitting of no dispute .::::find
But here was Mr. O'Mahony , as hot a Home-Ruler and Landleaguer as any <<target>> them , who was undoubtedly a gentleman , -- though an American gentleman .::::of
Can it be possible that we are wrong in <<target>> opinions respecting the others of the set ?::::our
She knew that her father had <<target>> an ass of himself .::::made
All the asinine proportions of the affair had been so explained to her <<target>> to leave no doubt on her mind as to the matter .::::as
But the more she was sure of it , the more resolved <<target>> became that Lord Castlewell should not call her father an ass .::::she
She might do so , -- and undoubtedly would after her own <<target>> , -- but no such privilege should be allowed to him .::::fashion
`` Yes , <<target>> do . ''::::i
`` Then , do n't <<target>> it any more . ''::::do
`` Yes , <<target>> shall .::::i
It is n't so very easy for a man not <<target>> make a goose of himself in that place .::::to
You 've got to sit by and <<target>> nothing for a year or two .::::do
A man can not afford to <<target>> his time in that manner .::::waste
There is all Ireland to be regenerated , and I have to learn <<target>> exact words which the prudery of the House of Commons will admit .::::the
Of course I have made a goose of myself ; but the question is whether I <<target>> not make a knave of myself in apologising for language which was undoubtedly true .::::did
Only think that a man so brutal , so entirely without feelings , without generosity , without any touch of sentiment , should be empowered by the Queen <<target>> England to lock up , not only every Irishman , but every American also , and to keep them there just as long as he pleases !::::of
And he revels <<target>> it .::::in
I do believe that he never eats a good breakfast unless half-a-dozen new 'suspects ' are reported by the <<target>> police in the morning ; and I am not to call such a man a 'disreputable jailer . '::::early
I may call him <<target>> 'distasteful warder . '::::a
It 's a disgrace to a man to sit <<target>> such a House and in such company .::::in
Of course I was a goose , but I was only <<target>> goose according to the practices of that special duck-pond . ''::::a
`` I do n't know much about it , father , '' said <<target>> , `` but I think you 'd better cut and run .::::rachel
Your twenty men will never <<target>> any good here .::::do
Everybody hates them who has got any money , and their only <<target>> are just men as Mr. Pat Carroll , of Ballintubber . ''::::friends
Then , later in the day , Lord Castlewell <<target>> to drive his bride in the Park .::::called
He had so far overcome family objections as to have induced <<target>> sister , Lady Augusta Montmorency , to accompany him .::::his
But it was no doubt better that he should marry Rachel than not be married at all ; <<target>> therefore Lady Augusta had allowed herself to be brought to accompany the singing girl upon this occasion .::::and
It had been represented to her that her brother was over head and ears in love with the young lady , and looking at the matter <<target>> round , she had thought it best to move a little from her dignity so as to take her sister-in-law coldly by the hand .::::all
Now , the two entered the room together , and Rachel kissed <<target>> Augusta , while she gave only her hand to Lord Castlewell .::::lady
But there was something in her manner on such occasions which was <<target>> to show affection , -- and did show it very plainly .::::intended
In old days she could decline to kiss Frank in <<target>> manner that would set Frank all on fire .::::a
It was as much as to say -- of course you 've a right to <<target>> , but on this occasion I do n't mean to give it to you .::::it
But Lord Castlewell was not imaginative , <<target>> did not think of all this .::::and
Rachel had intended him <<target>> think of it .::::to
`` Oh , <<target>> goodness ! ''::::my
began the lord , `` what a mess your <<target>> did make of it last night . ''::::father
And he frowned <<target>> he spoke .::::as
`` Of course he <<target>> that horrid man .::::abused
Everybody is abusing <<target>> . ''::::him
`` As for that , I 'm <<target>> going to defend the man . ''::::not
`` Then why do you say that <<target>> made a mess of it ? ''::::father
`` Everybody is <<target>> about it .::::talking
He has made himself ridiculous <<target>> the whole town . ''::::before
`` I do believe your father is the best fellow <<target>> ; but he ought not to touch politics .::::going
He made a great mistake <<target>> getting into the House .::::in
It is a source of misery <<target>> everyone connected with him . ''::::to
`` There 's time enough to think <<target>> it yet , '' said Rachel .::::about
`` No , there 's not , '' said Lord Castlewell , who intended to <<target>> in rather a gallant manner his intention of going on with the marriage .::::express
There shall be no time for going on with <<target>> , if my father is to be abused .::::it
As it happens , you do n't <<target>> with my father in politics .::::agree
I , as a woman , should have to call myself <<target>> belonging to your party , if we be ever married .::::as
I do not know what that party is , and care <<target>> little , as I am not a politician myself .::::very
And I suppose if we were married , you would take upon yourself <<target>> abuse my father for his politics , as he might abuse you .::::to
But while he is my father , and you are <<target>> my husband , I will not bear it .::::not
'Them 's my sentiments , ' as people say ; and perhaps your <<target>> had better think them over while there 's time enough . ''::::brother
So saying , she did pertinaciously refuse to be <<target>> by the noble lord on that occasion .::::driven
What a dear fellow <<target>> Frank Jones .::::is
That was Rachel 's first idea <<target>> Lord Castlewell left her .::::when
It was an idea she had driven from out of her mind with all the strength <<target>> which she was capable from the moment in which his lordship had been accepted .::::of
`` He never shall be dear to me again , '' she had said , thinking of what would be due to <<target>> husband ; and she had disturbed herself , not without some success , in expelling Frank Jones from her heart .::::her
It was not right that the future Lady <<target>> should be in love with Frank Jones .::::castlewell
But now she could think about <<target>> Jones as she pleased .::::frank
What a dear fellow <<target>> Frank Jones !::::is
Now , it certainly was the case that Lord <<target>> was not a dear fellow at all .::::castlewell
He was many degrees better than Mr. Moss , but <<target>> a dear fellow ! -- She only knew one .::::for
And she did tell herself now that the world could hardly be a happy world <<target>> her without one dear fellow , -- at any rate , to think of .::::to
But he had positively <<target>> to marry her !::::refused
But yet she did not in <<target>> least doubt his love .::::the
`` I 'm a little bit of a thing , '' she said <<target>> herself ; `` but then he likes little bits of things .::::to
At any rate , <<target>> likes one . ''::::he
And then she had thought ever so often over <<target>> cause which had induced Frank to leave her .::::the
But then again she contradicted <<target>> assertion to herself .::::the
`` If I were a man , '' she went on saying , `` I do n't think I should like to pay for my coat and waistcoat with money <<target>> a woman had earned ; and I should like it the less , because things at home , in my own house , were out of order . ''::::which
And then again she <<target>> of it all .::::thought
`` I should be an <<target>> to do that .::::idiot
I to do it , who am the greatest singer of my day , <<target>> who can , if I please , be Countess of Castlewell to-morrow !::::and
That were losing the world <<target>> love , indeed !::::for
Can any man 's <<target>> be worth it ?::::love
And I am going on to become such a singer <<target>> the world does not possess another like me .::::as
I feel it daily in the <<target>> sweetness of the music made .::::increasing
I see it in the eyes of the women , <<target>> are hardly satisfied that another should be so great .::::who
It comes in the worship of the people about the theatre , who have to tell me that I am <<target>> god , and keep the strings of the sack from which money shall be poured forth upon them .::::their
I know it is coming , and yet I am <<target>> marry the stupid earl because I have promised him .::::to
And he thinks , too , that his reflected honours will be more <<target>> me than all the fame that I can earn for myself .::::to
To go down to his castle , and to be dumb for ever , and <<target>> to be mother of some hideous little imp who shall be the coming marquis .::::perhaps
But Frank Jones is <<target>> to be had !::::not
If you could come and live in such a <<target>> hall as I could provide for you !::::marble
It should have all that we <<target>> , but nothing more .::::want
But it could not have that self-respect which it is <<target>> man 's first duty in life to achieve . ''::::a
But the thought that she had arrived at was this , -- that with all her <<target>> courtesy she would tell the Earl of Castlewell to look for a bride elsewhere .::::best
But she would do <<target>> in a hurry .::::nothing
The lord had been very civil to her , and she , on <<target>> part , would be as civil to the lord as circumstances admitted .::::her
And she had an idea in her mind that she could not at <<target>> moment 's notice dismiss this lord and be as she was before .::::a
Her engagement with the lord was <<target>> to all the musical world .::::known
The Mosses and Socanis spent their mornings , noons , and <<target>> in talking about it , -- as she well knew .::::nights
And she was not quite sure that the lord had given her such <<target>> palpable cause for quarrelling as to justify her in throwing him over .::::a
And when she had as it were thrown him over in her <<target>> , she began to think of other causes for regret .::::mind
After all , it was something <<target>> be Countess of Castlewell .::::to
She would soon live the Lady <<target>> down into a terrible mediocrity .::::augusta
And then again , there would <<target>> dreams of Frank Jones .::::be
Frank Jones had <<target>> utterly banished .::::been
She was much disturbed in mind , and resolved that she <<target>> seek counsel from her old correspondent , Frank 's sister .::::would
I know you will let me <<target>> to you in my troubles .::::write
I am in such a twitter of mind in consequence of my various lovers that I do not <<target>> where to turn ; nor do I quite know whom I am to call lover number one .::::know
Therefore , I write to <<target>> to ask advice .::::you
Dear old Frank used to <<target>> lover number one .::::be
Of course I ought to call him now Mr. Francis <<target>> , because another lover is really lover number one .::::jones
Did you ever think of the glory <<target>> being an absolutely live marchioness ?::::of
It is so overwhelming as to <<target>> almost too much for me .::::be
I think that I should not cower before my position , but that I should , on the <<target>> hand , endeavour to soar so high that I should be consumed by my own flames .::::other
Then there is lover number three -- Mr. Moss -- who , I <<target>> believe , loves me with the truest affection of them all .::::do
I have found him <<target>> at last .::::out
Now , which am I <<target>> take of these three ?::::to
Of course , if you are the honest girl I take you to be , you <<target>> write back word that one , at any rate , is not in the running .::::will
Mr. Francis Jones has <<target>> longer the honour .::::no
But what if I am sure that he loves me ; and what , <<target>> , if I am sure that he is the only one I love ?::::again
Let this be quite -- <<target>> -- between ourselves .::::quite
I am beginning to think that because of Frank <<target>> I can not marry that gorgeous earl .::::jones
What if Frank Jones <<target>> spoiled me altogether ?::::has
Tell me what you <<target>> of it .::::think
He wo n't <<target>> my money .::::take
But suppose I earn my money <<target>> another season or two ?::::for
Would not your Irish brutalities be then over ; and my <<target>> 's eloquence , and the eccentricities of the other gentlemen ?::::father
And would not your brother and your father <<target>> in some way settled their affairs ?::::have
Surely a little money wo n't then be amiss , though it <<target>> have come from the industry of a hard-worked young woman .::::may
Of course I am asking for mercy , because <<target>> am absolutely devoted to a certain young man .::::i
You need not tell him that in so many words ; but I do not see why I am to be ashamed of <<target>> devotion , -- seeing that I was not ashamed of my engagement , and boasted of it to all the world .::::my
And I have done nothing <<target>> to be ashamed of .::::since
You have never told me a word of your young man ; <<target>> the birds of the air are more communicative than some friends .::::but
A bird of the air has told me of you , and of Ada also , and had <<target>> me understand that from Ada has come all that sweetness which was to be expected from her .::::made
But from you has not come that compliance with <<target>> fate in life which circumstances have demanded .::::your
It could not but be the case that Edith should be <<target>> by the receipt of such a letter as this .::::gratified
Frank was now at home , and <<target>> terribly down in the mouth .::::was
Boycotting had lost all its <<target>> at Morony Castle .::::novelty
Frank , too , had become very tired of the work which fell to his lot , though he had been relieved in <<target>> heaviest labours of the farm by `` Emergency '' men , who had been sent to him from various parts of Ireland .::::the
Months had passed by since Pat Carroll had stood <<target>> the dock at Galway ready for his trial .::::in
He was now , in March , still kept <<target>> Galway jail under remand from the magistrates .::::in
A great clamour was made in <<target>> county upon the subject .::::the
Florian 's murder had stirred all those who were against <<target>> League to feel that the Government should be supported .::::the
The murder of Terry Carroll at the moment in which he was about to give evidence , -- <<target>> evidence , as the Leaguers said , -- against his brother was a great triumph to them .::::false
It was used as an argument why Pat Carroll should be no longer confined , while <<target>> 's death had been a reason why he never should be released at all .::::florian
All this kept the memory of Florian 's death , and the constant thought of it , still fresh in the minds of them <<target>> at Morony Castle , together with the poverty which had fallen upon them , had made the two men weary of their misfortunes .::::all
Under such misfortunes , when continued , <<target>> do become more weary than women .::::men
But Edith thought there would be something in the constancy of Rachel 's love to <<target>> her brother , and therefore the letter made her contented if not happy .::::cheer
For herself , she said to <<target>> no love could cheer her .::::herself
Captain Clayton still hung about Tuam and Headford , but his presence in the neighbourhood was always <<target>> be attributed to the evidence of which he was in search as to Florian 's death .::::to
It seemed now with him that the one great object <<target>> his heart was the unravelling of that murder .::::of
`` It was no mystery , '' as he <<target>> over and over again in Edith 's hearing .::::said
He knew very well who <<target>> fired the rifle .::::had
He could see , in his mind 's eye , the slight form of <<target>> crouching wretch as he too surely took his aim from the temporary barricade .::::the
The passion had become so strong with him of bringing the man to justice that he <<target>> felt , that between him and his God he could swear to having seen it .::::almost
And yet he knew that <<target>> was not so .::::it
To have the hanging of that man would be to him <<target>> privilege only next to that of possessing Edith Jones .::::a
And he was a sanguine man , and did believe that <<target>> process of time both privileges would be vouchsafed to him .::::in
But Edith was <<target>> sanguine .::::less
She could not admit to herself the possibility that there <<target>> be successful love between her and her hero .::::should
His presence there in the neighbourhood of her home was <<target>> by constant references to her brother 's blood .::::stained
`` He had better go away and just leave <<target>> to ourselves , '' she said to herself .::::us
But yet neither was she nor was Ada sunk so <<target>> in heart as her father and her brother .::::low
and she held up in <<target>> hand Rachel 's epistle .::::her
`` I care not at all , unless it be from that most <<target>> of all creatures , a tenant coming to pay his rent . ''::::improbable
`` Nothing quite so <<target>> as that . ''::::beautiful
`` Or from someone who has evidence to give about <<target>> of these murders that are going on ? ''::::some
-- A Mr. Morris from the other side of the lake , in County Mayo , had just been killed , and the <<target>> of men were now disturbed with this new horror. -- '' Anybody can kill anybody who has a taste in that direction .::::minds
What a country for a man with his <<target>> to pitch upon and live in !::::family
And that all this should have been kept under so long by policemen and right-thinking individuals , and then burst out like <<target>> subterranean fire all over the country , because the hope has been given them of getting their land for nothing !::::a
In order to indulge in wholesale robbery they are willing <<target>> a moment 's notice to undertake wholesale murder . ''::::at
After listening to words such as these , Edith found it impossible <<target>> introduce Rachel 's letter on the spur of the moment .::::to
Rachel , before the end of March , received the following <<target>> from her friend , but she received it in bed .::::letter
The whole world of Covent Garden Theatre had been thrown into panic-stricken dismay <<target>> the fact that Miss O'Mahony had something the matter with her throat .::::by
This was the second attack , the first having been so short as to have caused no trepidations in the world <<target>> music ; but this was supposed to be sterner in its nature , and to have caused already great alarm .::::of
Before March was over it was published to the world at large that <<target>> O'Mahony would not be able to sing during the forthcoming week .::::miss
In this catastrophe her lordly lover was <<target>> course the most sedulous of attendants .::::of
In truth he was so , though when we last met <<target>> and his bride together he had made himself very disagreeable .::::him
Rachel had then answered him in such language as to make her think it impossible that he <<target>> not quarrel with her ; but still here he was , constant at her chamber door .::::should
Whether his constancy was due to his position about the theatre or to his ardour as a lover , she did <<target>> know ; but in either case it troubled her somewhat , and interfered with her renewed dreams about Frank .::::not
Then came the following letter <<target>> Frank 's sister :::::from
Frank says that the separation had certainly come from him , because he could <<target>> bring himself to burden your prosperity with the heavy load of his misfortunes .::::not
They would have made you both miserable for awhile , <<target>> you could have agreed to postpone your marriage .::::unless
Why should it not <<target>> been postponed ?::::have
But Lord Castlewell came in the way , and I supposed him naturally <<target>> be as beautiful and gracious as he is gorgeous and rich .::::to
But though you say nothing about him there does creep out from your letter some kind <<target>> idea that he is not quite so beautiful in your eyes as was poor Frank .::::of
Remember that poor Frank has to wear two blue shirts a <<target>> and no more , in order to save the washing !::::week
How many does <<target>> Castlewell wear ?::::lord
How many will he wear <<target>> he is a marquis ?::::when
But at any rate it does seem to be the case that you and <<target>> earl are not as happy together as your best friends could wish .::::the
We had understood that the earl was ready to <<target>> for love at the sound of every note .::::expire
Has he slackened in his admiration so as to <<target>> his expiring to the close of every song ?::::postpone
Or why is it that Frank should be allowed <<target>> to come up and trouble your dreams ?::::again
You are so fond of joking that it is almost impossible for a <<target>> steady-going , boycotted young woman to follow you to the end .::::poor
Of course I understand that what you say <<target>> Mr. Moss is altogether a joke .::::about
If you love him the best , as I am sure you do -- so very much the best as to disregard the <<target>> halls -- I advise you , in the gentlest manner possible , to tell the marble halls that they are not wanted .::::marble
It can not be right to marry one man when <<target>> say that you love another as you do Frank .::::you
Of course he will wait <<target>> you like to wait .::::if
All I can say is , that no man <<target>> a girl better than he loves you .::::loves
We are very much down in <<target>> world at the present .::::the
We have literally <<target>> money .::::no
Nobody was thought to have done so well as he till lately ; but now <<target>> can not get their interest , and , of course , they are impatient .::::they
Commissioners have sat in the neighbourhood , <<target>> have reduced the rents all round .::::and
But they ca n't reduce <<target>> does n't exist .::::what
There are tenants who <<target>> suppose will pay .::::i
Pat Carroll could certainly <<target>> done so .::::have
But then papa 's share in the <<target>> will be reduced almost to nothing .::::property
He will not get above five shillings out of every twenty shillings of <<target>> , such as it was supposed to be when he bought it .::::rent
I do n't understand all this , and I <<target>> sure I can not make you do so .::::am
I have nothing to tell about my young man , as <<target>> call him , except that he can not be mine .::::you
I fancy that girls are not fond of writing about <<target>> young men when they do n't belong to them .::::their
Frank , at any rate , is yours , if you will take <<target>> ; and you can write about him with an open heart .::::him
I can not <<target>> so .::::do
Think of poor Florian <<target>> his horrid death .::::and
Is this a time for marriage , -- if it <<target>> otherwise possible , -- which it is not ?::::were
Let me hear from <<target>> again soon .::::you
I have said nothing <<target>> Frank as yet .::::to
You can imagine that he , poor fellow , <<target>> not very happy. -- Yours very affectionately ,::::is
Rachel read the letter on her sick bed , and as <<target>> as it was read Lord Castlewell came to her .::::soon
There was always a nurse there , but Lord Castlewell was supposed to be able <<target>> see the patient , and on one occasion had been accompanied by his sister .::::to
It was all done in the most proper <<target>> imaginable , much to Rachel 's disgust .::::form
Incapable as she was in her present state of carrying on any argument , she was desirous <<target>> explaining to Lord Castlewell that he was not to hold himself as bound to marry her .::::of
`` If you think that father is an ass , you had better <<target>> so outright , and let there be an end of it . ''::::say
She wished to speak to <<target>> after this fashion .::::him
But she could not say it in the <<target>> of the nurse and of Lady Augusta .::::presence
But Lord Castlewell 's conduct to herself made her more <<target>> than ever to say something of the kind .::::anxious
He was very civil , even tender , in <<target>> inquiries , but he was awfully frigid .::::his
She could tell from his manner that that last speech of hers was <<target>> in his bosom as the frigid words fell from his lips .::::rankling
He was waiting for some recovery , -- a partial recovery would be better <<target>> a whole one , -- and then he would speak his mind .::::than
She wanted to speak her mind first , but she could <<target>> do so with her throat in its present condition .::::hardly
She had no other friend than her father , no <<target>> friend to take her part with her lovers .::::other
And she had , too , fallen into such a <<target>> that she could not say much to him .::::state
According to the orders of the physician , she <<target>> not to interest herself at all about anything .::::was
`` I wonder whether the man was ever engaged to two or three lovers <<target>> once , '' she said to herself , alluding to the doctor .::::at
`` He knows at any rate of Lord Castlewell , and does <<target>> think that I am not to trouble myself about him ? ''::::he
She had a tablet under her pillow , which <<target>> took out and wrote on it certain instructions .::::she
`` Dear father , C. and I quarrelled before I was ill at <<target>> , and now he comes here just as though nothing had happened .::::all
He said you made an ass of <<target>> in the House of Commons .::::yourself
I wo n't have it , and mean to <<target>> him so ; but I ca n't talk .::::tell
Wo n't you tell him from me that I shall expect him to beg <<target>> pardon , and that I shall never hear anything of the kind again .::::my
It must come <<target>> this .::::to
Your own R. '' This was handed to Mr. O'Mahony by Rachel <<target>> very day before he went down to the House of Commons .::::that
`` But , <<target>> dear ! ''::::my
Rachel only shook <<target>> head .::::her
`` I can hardly say <<target>> this about myself .::::all
I do n't care twopence whether he <<target>> me an ass or not . ''::::thinks
`` But I do , '' <<target>> Rachel on the tablet .::::said
Then Mr. O'Mahony , feeling that he ought to leave her in <<target>> , made her a promise , and went his way .::::peace
He was much more likely to find Lord Castlewell among the singers of the day , <<target>> with the peers ; but of these things Mr. O'Mahony hardly understood all the particulars .::::than
`` Well , O'Mahony , how <<target>> your charming daughter ? ''::::is
`` My daughter is not inclined <<target>> be charming at all .::::to
I do hope she may be getting better , but <<target>> present she is bothering her head about you . ''::::at
`` It is natural that she should think of me <<target>> little sometimes , '' said the flattered lord .::::a
`` She has written me a message which <<target>> says that I am to deliver .::::she
Now mind , I do n't care about <<target>> the least in the world . ''::::it
Here the lord <<target>> very grave .::::looked
`` She says that you <<target>> me an ass .::::called
Well , I am to you , <<target>> you 're an ass to me .::::and
I am sure you wo n't take it <<target>> any insult , neither do I .::::as
We should both be hampered , <<target>> the truth would suffer .::::and
But as she is ill , perhaps it would be better <<target>> you should say that you did n't mean it . ''::::that
But this was not at all Lord <<target>> 's view of the matter .::::castlewell
Though he had been very glib with his tongue in calling O'Mahony an ass , he <<target>> not at all like the compliment as paid back to him by his father-in-law .::::did
And there was something which he did not quite <<target>> in the assertion that the truth would suffer .::::understand
He had been turned out of the House of Commons only yesterday for <<target>> that the Speaker was quite wrong , and sticking to it .::::saying
There was not the slightest doubt <<target>> the world about it .::::in
But his lordship knew his gamut , which was all that he pretended <<target>> know , and never interfered with matters of which he was ignorant .::::to
And then he had it in his mind to speak very seriously to <<target>> as soon as she might be well enough to hear him .::::rachel
`` You have spoken to me in a manner , my <<target>> , which I am sure you did not intend . ''::::dear
He had all the words ready prepared on <<target>> bit of paper in his pocket-book .::::a
And he was by no means sure but that <<target>> little quarrel might even yet become permanent .::::the
He had discussed it frequently with Lady Augusta , and <<target>> Augusta rather wished that it might become permanent .::::lady
And Lord Castlewell was not quite sure <<target>> he did not wish it also .::::that
The young lady had a way of speaking about <<target>> own people which was not to be borne .::::her
And now she had been guilty of the gross indecency of sending a message to <<target>> by her own father , -- the very man whom he called an ass .::::him
And the man in return only <<target>> and called him an ass .::::laughed
But Lord Castlewell knew <<target>> proprieties of life .::::the
Here was this -- girl whom he had proposed <<target>> marry , a sad invalid at the moment .::::to
The doctor had , in fact , given <<target>> but a sad account of the case .::::him
`` She has strained her voice continually till it threatens to leave her , '' said the <<target>> ; `` I do not say that it will be so , but it may .::::doctor
Her best chance will be to abandon <<target>> professional exertions till next year . ''::::all
Then the doctor told him that he had not as yet taken <<target>> himself to hint anything of all this to Miss O'Mahony .::::upon
Lord Castlewell was puzzled <<target>> the extreme .::::in
If the lady lost her voice and so became penniless and without a profession ; and if he in such <<target>> were to throw her over , and leave her unmarried , what would the world say of him ?::::case
Would it be possible then to make the world understand that he had deserted her , not on <<target>> of her illness , but because she had not liked to hear her father called an ass .::::account
And had not Rachel already begun the battle in a manner <<target>> to show that she meant to be the victor ?::::intended
Could it be possible that she <<target>> was desirous of backing out .::::herself
There was no knowing the extent of the <<target>> to which these Americans would not go !::::impudence
No doubt she had , by the use of intemperate language on the occasion when she <<target>> not be driven out in the carriage , given him ample cause for a breach .::::would
To tell the truth , he had thought <<target>> that a breach would be expedient .::::then
But she had fallen ill , and it was <<target>> on him to be tender and gentle .::::incumbent
Then , from her very sick bed , <<target>> had sent him this impudent message .::::she
And it had been <<target>> so impudently !::::delivered
`` The truth <<target>> suffer ! ''::::would
He was sure that there was a meaning in the words intended to signify that <<target>> , Lord Castlewell , was and must be an ass at all times .::::he
Then he asked himself whether he was an ass <<target>> he did not quite understand O'Mahony 's argument .::::because
Why did the <<target>> suffer ?::::truth
All the world <<target>> so .::::said
He had been turned out of the House for saying the Speaker <<target>> wrong , and not apologising for having uttered such words .::::was
And he , Lord Castlewell , had so expressed himself only <<target>> the woman who was about to be his wife .::::to
Then she had had the incredible folly to tell her father , and the <<target>> had told him that under certain circumstances the `` truth must suffer . ''::::father
He was not at all ashamed <<target>> marrying a singing girl .::::of
It was the thing he <<target>> be sure to do .::::would
And he thought of some singing girls before his time , and of his time <<target>> , whom it would be an honour for such as him to marry .::::also
But he would degrade himself -- so he felt -- <<target>> the connection with an advanced Landleaguing Member of Parliament .::::by
He looked round the lot of them , and he assured himself that there was <<target>> one from whose loins an English nobleman could choose a wife without disgrace .::::not
The man had not become Member of <<target>> till quite the other day .::::parliament
He had not even opened his mouth in <<target>> till the engagement had been made .::::parliament
And now , among them all , <<target>> O'Mahony was the biggest ass .::::this
And yet Lord Castlewell found himself quite unable to hold his own with <<target>> Irish member when the Irish member was brought to attack him .::::the
He certainly would have made Rachel 's conduct a fair excuse <<target>> breaking with her , -- only that she was ill .::::for
If he could have known the state of Rachel 's <<target>> there might have been an end to his troubles .::::mind
She had now , at length , been made thoroughly wretched by hearing the truth <<target>> the doctor , -- or what the doctor believed to be the truth .::::from
`` Miss O'Mahony , I had better tell you , your <<target>> has gone , at any rate for a year . ''::::voice
`` For a <<target>> ! ''::::year
The hoarse , angry , rusty whisper came forth from her , <<target>> in spite of its hoarseness and rustiness was audible enough .::::and
For heaven 's sake do n't <<target>> ; use your tablet . ''::::talk
Rachel drew the tablet from under her <<target>> and dashed it across the room .::::pillow
The doctor picked it up , and , with a kind smile and a <<target>> caressing motion of his hand , put it again back under the pillow .::::little
Rachel buried her head amidst <<target>> bedclothes and sobbed bitterly .::::the
`` Try to make yourself happy in remembering how <<target>> have succeeded , '' said the doctor .::::you
`` It wo n't be back just the <<target>> , '' she wrote on her tablet .::::same
`` It is in God 's <<target>> , '' said the doctor .::::hands
There came not another word from Rachel , either <<target>> her tablet or by any struggle at speech .::::by
The doctor , having made what attempts at <<target>> he could , went his way .::::comfort
Then her father , who had been in <<target>> out constantly , came to his daughter .::::and
But she made no <<target>> to answer him .::::attempt
At her time of life <<target>> year is an eternity .::::a
And then this doctor had only told her <<target>> her voice was in God 's hands .::::that
She could talk to <<target>> without any effort .::::herself
`` When they say that <<target>> always condemn you .::::they
When the doctor tells you that you are in <<target>> 's hands he means the Devil 's . ''::::god
She had been so near the gods and goddesses , and <<target>> she was no more than any other poor woman .::::now
She might be less , as her face <<target>> begun to wither with her voice .::::had
She had all but succeeded ; as for her face , <<target>> for the mere look of her , let it go .::::as
She told herself that she <<target>> nothing for her appearance .::::cared
And then to open her mouth and to let the music go forth and to see the ears all erect , as she <<target>> she could , so that not a sound should be lost , -- should not be harvested by the hungry hearers !::::fancied
That was to be <<target>> very god !::::a
As she told herself of all her regrets , there <<target>> not a passing sorrow given to Lord Castlewell .::::was
And what of <<target>> other man ?::::the
There need be no <<target>> taking money . ''::::more
But she did take some comfort at last <<target>> that promise of God 's hands .::::in
When her father had been with her half-an-hour , and was beginning to think that he could escape and go down to the House , -- and he had a rod in <<target>> for the Speaker 's back , such a rod that the Speaker 's back should be sore for the rest of the session -- Rachel began her lengthened conversation with him .::::pickle
In the last half-hour she had made up <<target>> mind as to what she would say .::::her
But the conversation was so long and intricate , being necessarily carried on by means <<target>> her tablet , that poor O'Mahony 's rod was losing all its pickle .::::of
`` Father , you must go and <<target>> Lord Castlewell at once . ''::::see
`` I think , my dear , he understood me altogether when <<target>> saw him before , and he seemed to agree with me .::::i
`` It is n't about that at <<target>> , '' said the tablet .::::all
`` What else do <<target>> want ? ''::::you
Then Rachel went to work and wrote her <<target>> with what deliberation she could assume .::::demand
`` You must go and tell him that I <<target>> n't want to marry him at all .::::do
He has been very kind , and you must n't <<target>> him that he 's an ass any more .::::tell
He has proposed to marry me because he has wanted a singing girl ; and I <<target>> I should have done for him , -- only I ca n't sing . ''::::think
Then the father replied , having put himself into such a position on the bed as to read the tablet <<target>> Rachel was filling it : `` But that 'll all come right in a very short time . ''::::while
`` It ca n't , <<target>> it wo n't .::::and
The doctor says a year ; but he knows nothing about <<target>> , and says it 's in God 's hands .::::it
He means by that it 's as <<target>> as it can be . ''::::bad
`` But , <<target>> dear -- ''::::my
`` I tell you it <<target>> be so . ''::::must
`` But you <<target>> engaged .::::are
He would never be so base a man as to <<target>> your word at such a moment as this .::::take
If you had had small-pox , or anything horrible like <<target>> , he would not have been justified . ''::::that
`` I 'm as ugly as ever I can be , '' <<target>> the tablet , `` and as poor a creature . ''::::said
Then she stopped her <<target>> for a moment .::::pencil
Why , my dear , I 'd have to cowhide <<target>> if he said a word of the kind . ''::::him
`` Oh , <<target>> ! ''::::no
said the tablet <<target>> frantic energy .::::with
`` But you see <<target>> I would n't !::::if
You see if <<target>> do n't !::::i
`` But I do n't love <<target>> , '' said the tablet .::::him
`` Goodness gracious <<target>> ! ''::::me
When he spoke of you in that way I began to <<target>> of it , and I found I hated him .::::think
I do hate him like poison , and <<target>> want you to tell him so . ''::::i
`` Never mind <<target>> disagreeables .::::the
I tell you he wo n't be the <<target>> pleased of the lot of us .::::worst
He wanted a singer , and not a Landleaguer 's daughter ; now he <<target>> n't got the singer , but has got the Landleaguer 's daughter .::::has
And I 'll tell you <<target>> else I want -- ''::::something
`` What do <<target>> want ? ''::::you
asked the father , when her hand <<target>> a moment ceased to scrawl .::::for
`` I want , '' she <<target>> , `` Frank Jones .::::said
Now you know all <<target>> it . ''::::about
He went on talking to her till he had <<target>> the Speaker and the rod in pickle .::::forgotten
He besought her to think better of it ; and if not <<target>> , just at present to postpone any action in the matter .::::that
He explained to her how very disagreeable it would be to him to have <<target>> go to the lord with such a message as she now proposed .::::to
But she only enhanced the vehemence of her order by shaking <<target>> head as her face lay buried in the pillow .::::her
`` Let it wait for one <<target>> , '' said the father .::::fortnight
said the girl , using her <<target>> voice for the effort .::::own
Then the father slowly took himself off , and making his way to the House of Commons , renewed his <<target>> as he went , and had himself again turned out before he had been half-an-hour in the House .::::passion
The earl was sitting alone after breakfast two or three days <<target>> , thinking in truth of his difficulty with Rachel .::::subsequently
It had come to be manifest to him that he must <<target>> the girl unless something terrible should occur to her .::::marry
`` She might die , '' he said to himself very sadly , <<target>> to think of cases in which singers had died from neglected throats .::::trying
And it did make <<target>> very sad .::::him
He could not think of the perishing of that magnificent treble without great <<target>> ; and , after his fashion , he did love her personally .::::grief
He did not know that he could <<target>> love anyone very much better .::::ever
He had certainly thought that it would be a good thing that his father and mother and sister should go and live in foreign lands , -- in order , <<target>> short , that they might never more be heard of to trouble him , -- but he did not even contemplate their deaths , so sweet-minded was he .::::in
But in the first fury of his love he had thought how nice it would <<target>> to be left with his singing girl , and no one to trouble him .::::be
Now there came across him an idea that something was due to the Marquis of Beaulieu , -- something , that is , <<target>> his own future position ; and what could he do with a singing girl for his wife who could not sing ?::::to
He was unhappy as he thought of it all , and would ever and again , as he meditated , be <<target>> up to mild anger when he remembered that he had been told that `` the truth would suffer . ''::::stirred
He had intended , at any rate , that his singing <<target>> should be submissive and obedient while in his hands .::::girl
But here had been <<target>> outbreak of passion !::::an
And here was this confounded O'Mahony ready to make a fool <<target>> himself at a moment 's notice before all the world .::::of
dear , '' exclaimed the lord , `` <<target>> do you do , Mr. O'Mahony ?::::how
But upon my word , I do n't know how <<target>> tell you what I 've got to say . ''::::to
`` Has anything gone <<target>> with Rachel ? ''::::wrong
`` What do you <<target>> by that ? ''::::mean
`` I really hardly know how <<target>> ought to break it .::::i
You must have learned by this time that Rachel is <<target>> girl determined to have her own way . ''::::a
`` And , upon my word , when I think of myself , I <<target>> that I have nothing to do but what she bids me . ''::::feel
`` It 's more than you <<target>> for the Speaker , Mr .::::do
But Rachel , though she is inclined to be tyrannical , is not <<target>> a downright positive old blue-bottle nincompoop as that white-wigged king of kings .::::such

They did something over there to make me an American ; <<target>> they did nothing to unmake me as an Irishman .::::but
And there I am , member for Cavan ; and it will go hard with me <<target>> I do n't break that Speaker 's heart before I 've done with him .::::if
I ai n't to say that he goes wrong <<target>> he never goes right by any chance ? ''::::when
It was you who threw the <<target>> in my teeth . ''::::speaker
Lord Castlewell did acknowledge to <<target>> his own imprudence .::::himself
`` I came here to tell you about my daughter , and upon my word I <<target>> find it more difficult than anything I may have to say to the Speaker .::::shall
I have the most profound <<target>> for the Speaker . ''::::contempt
`` Perhaps he <<target>> it . ''::::returns
`` I do n't believe he does , or he would n't make <<target>> much of me as to turn me out of the House .::::so
When a man finds it necessary to remove an enemy , let the cause <<target>> what it may , he can not be said to despise that enemy .::::be
Now , I would n't give a puff of <<target>> to turn him out of the House .::::breath
In truth , I despise <<target>> too much . ''::::him
`` He is to be pitied , '' said <<target>> lord , with a gentle touch of irony .::::the
`` I 'll tell you <<target>> , Lord Castlewell -- ''::::what
I did n't come here to <<target>> about him at all .::::speak
And the Chairman of <<target>> is positively worse .::::committees

`` Now , Mr. O'Mahony , I really must beg <<target>> you will fight your political battles anywhere but here .::::that

How is your charming <<target>> this morning ? ''::::daughter
`` She is <<target>> but charming .::::anything
I hardly know what to make of her , but I find <<target>> I am always obliged to do what she tells me . ''::::that
There was another allusion to the Speaker on the <<target>> 's tongue , but he restrained himself .::::lord
`` She has sent me here to say that <<target>> wants the marriage to be broken off . ''::::she
She says that you intend to marry her because she 's a <<target>> girl ; -- and now she ca n't sing . ''::::singing
`` And she thinks she ought n't to have accepted <<target>> at all , -- that 's the truth . ''::::you
The lord 's face <<target>> very long .::::became
`` I think myself that it <<target>> a little too hurried .::::was
I do n't suppose you quite <<target>> your own minds . ''::::knew
She has got something into her head <<target>> I ca n't quite explain .::::that
She thought that she 'd do for a countess very well <<target>> long as she was on the boards of a theatre .::::as
But now that she 's to be relegated to private life she begins to <<target>> that she ought to look after someone about her own age . ''::::feel
Is this her <<target>> ? ''::::message
I should n't in such a matter invent <<target>> all if she had n't sent me .::::it
But yet she did , '' remarked Mr. O'Mahony , calling to <<target>> the assertion made by Rachel that she wanted Frank Jones .::::mind
Frank Jones was about her own age , whereas <<target>> lord was as old as her father .::::the
`` Upon my word , I am <<target>> obliged to Miss O'Mahony . ''::::much
`` She certainly has meant to be as courteous <<target>> she knows how , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::as
`` Perhaps on your side of the <<target>> they have different ideas of courtesy .::::water
The young lady sends me word that now she means to retire <<target>> the stage she finds I am too old for her . ''::::from
But he said it in an apologetic <<target>> , as though admitting the truth .::::tone
Lord Castlewell , as he sat there for a few moments , acknowledged to himself that Rachel possessed certain <<target>> of character which had something fine about them , from whatever side of the water she had come .::::traits
He was a reasonable man , and he considered that there was a way made <<target>> him to escape from this trouble which was not to have been expected .::::for
Had Rachel been an English girl , or an Italian , or <<target>> Norwegian , he would hardly have been let off so easily .::::a
As he was an earl , and about to be a marquis , and as he <<target>> a rich man , such suitors are not generally given up in a hurry .::::was
This young lady had sent word to him that she had lost her voice permanently and was therefore obliged to <<target>> that high title , that noble name , and those golden hopes which had glistened before her eyes .::::surrender
No doubt he had offered to marry her because of her singing ; -- that <<target>> , he would not have so offered had she not have been a singer .::::is
But he could not have departed from his <<target>> simply because she had become dumb .::::engagement
He quite understood that Mr. O'Mahony would have been there with his cowhide , and though he was by no means <<target>> coward be did not wish to encounter the American Member of the House of Commons in all his rage .::::a
In fact , he had been governed in his previous ideas by a feeling of propriety ; but propriety certainly <<target>> not demand him to marry a young lady who had sent to tell him that he was too old .::::did
And this irate member of the House of <<target>> had come to bring him the message !::::commons
`` What am I expected <<target>> suggest now ? ''::::to
`` Just your affectionate blessing , and you 're very <<target>> , '' said Mr. O'Mahony , with a shrug .::::sorry
`` That 's the kind of <<target>> , I should say . ''::::thing
He could n't send her his affectionate blessing , <<target>> he could n't say he was very sorry .::::and
Had the young lady been about to marry his son , -- had there been such a son , -- he <<target>> have blessed her ; and he felt that his own personal dignity did not admit of an expression of sorrow .::::could
Was he to let the <<target>> lady off altogether ?::::young
There was something nearly akin , -- very nearly akin , -- <<target>> true love in his bosom as he thought of this .::::to
The girl was ill , and no doubt weak , and <<target>> been made miserable by the loss of her voice .::::had
The doctor had told him that her voice , for <<target>> singing purposes , had probably gone for ever .::::all
But her beauty remained ; -- had not so faded , at <<target>> , as to have given any token of permanent decay .::::least
And that peculiarly bright eye was there ; and <<target>> wit of the words which had captivated him .::::the
The very smallness of her stature , with its perfect <<target>> , had also gone far to enrapture him .::::symmetry
No doubt , <<target>> was forty .::::he
He did not openly pretend <<target>> to be less .::::even
And where was the young lady , singer or no singer , who if <<target>> , would reject the heir to a marquisate because he was forty ?::::disengaged
And he did not believe that Rachel had sent him <<target>> message in which allusion was made to his age .::::any
That had been added by the stupid father , who was , without <<target>> , the biggest fool that either America or Ireland had ever produced .::::doubt
Now that the matter had been brought before him in such bald terms , he was by <<target>> means sure that he was desirous of accepting the girl 's offer to release him .::::no
And the father evidently had <<target>> desire to catch him .::::no
`` It 's very hard to know <<target>> I 'm to say . ''::::what
Here Mr. O'Mahony <<target>> his head .::::shook
`` I think that , perhaps , I <<target>> better come and call upon her . ''::::had
`` You must n't <<target>> a word !::::speak
And , if you 're to be considered as no longer engaged , perhaps there might <<target>> -- you know -- something -- well , something of delicacy in the matter ! ''::::be
Mr. O'Mahony felt at the moment that he <<target>> to protect the interests of Frank Jones .::::ought
At any rate I am not disposed to send <<target>> my blessing at present as a final step .::::her
An engagement to be married is a <<target>> serious step in life . ''::::very
But her father remembered that she had <<target>> him that she wanted Frank Jones .::::told
It would be the <<target>> thing to do .::::honest
And yet he felt that his <<target>> should have another chance .::::girl
`` I think we had better leave it <<target>> the present , '' said the lord .::::for
`` I feel that in the midst of all your eloquence <<target>> do not quite catch Miss O'Mahony 's meaning . ''::::i
O'Mahony felt that this lord was as <<target>> a lord as any of them .::::bad
He would like to force the lord to meet him at some debating club where there was no wretched Speaker <<target>> there force him to give an answer on any of the burning questions which now excited the two countries .::::and
I will explain to Rachel as soon as I <<target>> that the matter is still left in abeyance .::::can
Of course we feel the honour done us by your <<target>> in not desiring to accept at once her decision .::::lordship
Her condition is <<target>> doubt sad .::::no
But I suppose she may expect to hear once <<target>> from yourself in a short time . ''::::more
So Mr. O'Mahony took his leave , and as he went to Cecil <<target>> endeavoured in his own mind to investigate the character of Lord Castlewell .::::street
That he was a fool there could be no doubt , a fool with whom he would not be <<target>> to live in the constant intercourse of married life for any money that could be offered to him .::::forced
He was a man who , without singing himself , <<target>> for nothing but the second-hand life of a theatre .::::cared
But then he , Mr. O'Mahony , was not a young <<target>> , and was not expected to marry Lord Castlewell .::::woman
But he had told himself over and over again <<target>> Lord Castlewell had been `` caught . ''::::that
He had not quite approved of Rachel 's conduct , <<target>> the lord had been fair game for a woman .::::but
What the deuce was he to think now of <<target>> lord who would not be let off ?::::the
`` I wonder whether it can be love for her , '' said <<target>> to himself ; `` such love as I used to feel . ''::::he
Then he sighed heavily <<target>> he went home .::::as
It was now April , and this <<target>> was a sad month in Ireland .::::april
I do not know why the deaths of two such men as were then murdered should touch the heart with a deeper sorrow than is felt for the fate of others whose lot is lower in life ; why the poor <<target>> , who has lost her husband while doing his duty amidst outrages and unmanly revenges , is not to be so much thought of as the sweet lady who has been robbed of her all in the same fashion .::::widow
But so it is <<target>> human nature .::::with
We know how a people will weep for their Sovereign , and it was with such tears as that , with <<target>> as sincere as those shed for the best of kings , that Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke were lamented .::::tears
In April these two men had fallen , hacked <<target>> death in front of the Viceregal Lodge .::::to
By whom they were killed , as I write now , no one <<target>> , and as regards Lord Frederick one can hardly guess the reason .::::knows
He had come over to Ireland on that very day , to take the place which his luckier predecessor <<target>> just vacated , and had as yet done no service , and excited no vengeance in Ireland .::::had
He had only attended an opening pageant ; -- because with him had come a new <<target>> Lieutenant , -- not new indeed to the office , but new in his return .::::lord
An accident had brought the two together on the day , but Lord <<target>> was altogether a stranger , and yet he had been selected .::::frederick
Such had been his fate , and such also the fate of Mr. Burke , who , <<target>> to him in official rank , may possibly have been in truth the doomed one .::::next
They were both dealt with horribly on that April <<target>> , -- and all Ireland was grieving .::::morning
All Ireland was repudiating the crime , and saying that <<target>> horror had surely been done by American hands .::::this
Even the murderers native to Ireland seemed <<target>> be thoroughly ashamed of this deed .::::to
It would be needless here to tell , -- or to attempt to tell , -- how <<target>> Lord-Lieutenant had made way for another , and one Chief Secretary for another Chief Secretary .::::one
It would be trying <<target>> do too much .::::to
In the pages of a novel the novelist can hardly do more than indicate the sources of the troubles which have fallen <<target>> the country , and can hardly venture to deal with the names and characters of those who have been concerned .::::upon
As far as he had agreed with the Government in their measure for interfering with the price paid for land in the country , -- for putting <<target>> a new law devised by themselves in lieu of that time-honoured law by which property has ever been protected in England , -- I disagree .::::up
Of my disagreement no one will take notice ; -- <<target>> my story can not be written without expressing it .::::but
But down at Morony Castle , mingled with their sorrows , there was a joy and a triumph ; not loud indeed , not sounded with trumpets , not as yet perfect , <<target>> quite assured even in the mind of one man ; but yet assuring in the mind of that man , -- and indeed of one other , -- almost to conviction .::::not
That man was Captain Yorke Clayton , and that other <<target>> was only poor Hunter , the wounded policeman .::::man
For such triumph as was theirs a victim is needed ; and in <<target>> case the victim , the hoped-for victim , was Mr. Lax .::::this
Nothing had ever been made out in regard to the <<target>> of Terry Carroll in the Court House at Galway .::::murder
Irish mysteries are coming to be unriddled now , <<target>> there will be no unriddling of that .::::but
Yorke Clayton , together with Hunter and all the police of <<target>> Galway , could do nothing in regard to that mystery .::::county
They had struggled their very best , and , from the nature of <<target>> crime , had found themselves almost obliged to discover the perpetrator .::::the
The press of the two countries , the newspapers in other respects so hostile to each <<target>> , had united in declaring that the police were bound to know all about it .::::other
The police had determined to know nothing about it , because <<target>> Government did not dare to bring forward such evidence .::::the
This was the Irish Landleague view ; and though it contained an accusation against the Government <<target>> having contrived the murder itself , it was all the better on that account .::::for
The English papers simply said that the <<target>> police must be fast asleep .::::galway
This man had been murdered when in the <<target>> hands of the officers of justice .::::very
The judge had seen <<target>> shots fired .::::the
The victim fell into the <<target>> of four policemen .::::hands
The pistol was found <<target>> his feet .::::at
It was done in daylight , <<target>> all Galway was looking on .::::and
The kind of things that were said by one set of <<target>> and another drove Yorke Clayton almost out of his wits .::::newspapers
He had to maintain a show of good <<target>> , and he did maintain it gallantly .::::humour
But , in truth , nothing could <<target>> done as to that Galway case .::::be
Mr. Lax was still in custody , and was advised by <<target>> not to give any account of himself at that time .::::counsel
It was indecent on the part of the prosecution <<target>> he should be asked to do so .::::that
So said the lawyers on his side , but it was clear that nobody in the court and <<target>> in Galway could be got to say that he or she had seen him do it .::::nobody
And yet Yorke Clayton had himself seen <<target>> hip of the stooping man .::::the
`` I suppose I could n't swear to it , '' he said to himself ; and <<target>> would be hard to see how he could swear to the man without forswearing himself .::::it
He did n't care a straw what the newspapers said of <<target>> , so long as he could hang Mr. Lax .::::him
His triumph in that respect <<target>> drown all other failures .::::would
Mr. Lax was still in custody , and many insolent petitions had been <<target>> on his behalf in order that he might be set free .::::made
`` Did the Crown intend to pretend that they had any shadow <<target>> evidence against him as to the shooting of Terry Carroll ? ''::::of
`` No ; -- but there was another <<target>> committed a day or two before .::::murder
Poor young Florian Jones <<target>> been murdered .::::had
Even presuming that Lax 's hand can not be seen visible in the matter of Terry <<target>> , there is , we think , something to connect him with the other murder .::::carroll
The two , no doubt , <<target>> committed in the same interest .::::were
The Crown is not prepared to allow Lax <<target>> escape from its hands quite yet . ''::::to
Then there were many words on the subject going on just at the time at which Lax especially wanted his freedom , and <<target>> which , to tell the truth , Yorke Clayton was near the end of his tether in regard to poor Florian .::::at
In the beginning of his inquiry as to the Ballyglunin murder , he entertained an idea that Lax , after firing <<target>> shot , had been seen by that wicked car-driver , who had boycotted Mr. Jones in his great need .::::the
The reader will probably have forgotten that Mr. Jones had required to be driven home to Morony Castle from Ballyglunin station , and <<target>> been refused the accommodation by a wicked old Landleaguer , who had joined the conspiracy formed in the neighbourhood against Mr. Jones .::::had
The man 's name was Teddy Mooney , the father <<target>> Kit Mooney who stopped the hunting at Moytubber .::::of
And he certainly <<target>> patriotic .::::was
From day to day he went on refusing fares , -- for the boycotted personages were after all more capable of paying fares than the <<target>> hero of doing without them , -- suffering much himself from want of victuals , and more on behalf of his poor animal .::::boycotting
Kit was a baker , and did earn wages ; but <<target>> utterly refused to subsidise the patriotism of his father .::::he
`` If ye ca n't do that for the ould counthry , '' said <<target>> , `` ye ai n't half the man I took ye for . ''::::kit
But he refused him a gallon <<target>> oats for his horse .::::of
It was not at once that <<target>> old man gave way .::::the
He went on boycotting individuals till he had n't a pair of breeches left to sit upon , and the non-boycotted tradesmen of the little towns <<target>> declined to sit upon his car , because the poor horse , fed upon roadside grasses , refused to be urged into a trot .::::around
`` Tare and ages , man , <<target>> 's the good of it ?::::what
Ai n't we a-cutting the noses off our own faces , and that with the money <<target>> scarce that I have n't seen the sight of a half-crown this two weeks . ''::::so
It was thus that he declared his purpose of going back to the common unpatriotic ways <<target>> mankind , to an old pal , whom he had known all his days .::::of
He did do so , <<target>> found , alas !::::but
that his trade had perished in the <<target>> or forced itself into other channels .::::meanwhile
The result was that Teddy Mooney became very bitter in spirit , <<target>> was for a while an Orangeman , and almost a Protestant .::::and
The evil things that had been done <<target>> him were terrible to his spirit .::::to
He had been threatened with eviction from ten acres of ground because he could n't pay his rent ; or , as <<target>> said , because he had declined to drive a maid-servant to the house of another gentleman who was also boycotted .::::he
This had not been true , but <<target>> had served to embitter Teddy Mooney .::::it
And now , at last , he had <<target>> to belong to the other side .::::determined
When an Irishman does make up his mind to <<target>> the other side he is very much determined .::::serve
When Kit Mooney had first laid down the law to his father , how he ought to assist in <<target>> all the enemies of the Landleague , no one saw his way clearer than did Teddy Mooney .::::boycotting
`` I would n't mind doing without a bit or a sup , '' he said , <<target>> his son explained to him that he might have to suffer a little for the cause .::::when
`` Not a bit or a sup <<target>> the ould counthry wants it . ''::::when
He had since had a few words with his son Kit , <<target>> was now quite on the other side of the question .::::and
He was told that somebody had threatened to cut off his <<target>> mare 's tail because he had driven Phil D'Arcy .::::old
Since that he had become a martyr as well as an Orangeman , <<target>> was disposed to go any length `` for the gintl'men . ''::::and
This had come all about by degrees -- had been coming about since poor Florian 's murder ; <<target>> at last he wrote a letter to Yorke Clayton , or got someone else to write it :::::and
`` Yer Honour , -- It <<target>> Lax as dropped Master Flory .::::was
Divil a doubt <<target>> it .::::about
There 's one as can tell more about it <<target>> is on the road from Ballyglunin all round .::::as
This comes from a well-wisher <<target>> the ould cause .::::to
When Captain Clayton received this he at <<target>> knew from whom it had come .::::once
The Landleaguing car-driver , who had turned gentlemen 's friend , <<target>> sufficiently well known to history to have been talked about .::::was
Clayton , therefore , did not lose much time in going down to Ballyglunin <<target>> and requiring to be driven yet once again from thence to Carnlough .::::station
`` And now , Mr. Teddy Mooney , '' he said , after they had travelled together a mile or two from Ballyglunin , and had come almost to <<target>> spot at which the poor boy had been shot , `` tell me what you know about Mr. Lax 's movements in this part of the world . ''::::the
He had never come there before since the fatal day without <<target>> three policemen with him , but now he was alone .::::having
Such a man as Teddy Mooney would be most unwilling to <<target>> his mouth in the presence of two or more persons .::::open
`` O Lord , Captain , how you <<target>> on a poor fellow all unawares ! ''::::come
`` Whereabouts was it the <<target>> gentleman perished ? ''::::young
`` Them 's the very shot-holes , '' said Teddy , pointing up to the temporary embrasure , which had indeed been knocked down half <<target>> score of times since the murder , and had been as often replaced by the diligent care of Mr. Blake and Captain Clayton .::::a
And which way did <<target>> murderer run ? ''::::the
Teddy pointed with his whip away to the east , over <<target>> ground on which the man had made his escape .::::the
`` And where did you <<target>> see him ? ''::::first
It became horrible to his imagination as he thought that <<target>> was about to tell of such a deed .::::he
`` It was over there , nigh <<target>> widow Dolan 's cottage . ''::::to
`` It was n't the widow who <<target>> him , I think ? ''::::saw
`` Faix , it was the widow <<target>> , with her own eyes .::::thin
And yet I did know him , for I 'd <<target>> him once travelling from Ballinasloe with Pat Carroll .::::seen
And Lax is a man as when you 've <<target>> seen him you 've seen him for allays .::::once
But she knowed <<target>> well .::::him
Her husband was one of the <<target>> when the Fenians were up .::::boys
`` And who else <<target>> there ? ''::::was
`` There was no one else ; but only her darter , a slip <<target>> a girl o ' fifteen , come up while Lax was there .::::of
I know she come up , because I saw <<target>> coming jist as I passed the door . ''::::her
Captain Clayton entered into very friendly relations with Teddy Mooney on that occasion , trying to make him understand , without any absolute promises , that all the <<target>> and all the rewards , -- in fact , all the bacon and oats , -- lay on the dish to which Mr. Lax did not belong .::::luck
That did not in the least shock Captain Clayton , who certainly <<target>> have believed nothing had the truth been told him without hesitation .::::would
At last it came out that the car-driver was sure as to the personality of Lax , -- had seen him again and again <<target>> he had first made his acquaintance in Carroll 's company , and could swear to having seen him in the widow 's cabin .::::since
He knew also that the widow and <<target>> daughter were intimate with Lax .::::her
He had not seen <<target>> shot fired .::::the
This he said in an assured tone , <<target>> Captain Clayton had known that before .::::but
He did not expect to find anyone who had seen <<target>> shot fired , except Mr. Jones and Peter .::::the
As to Peter he <<target>> his suspicions .::::had
Mr. Jones was certain that Peter had told the truth in declaring that he had <<target>> no one ; but the Captain had argued the matter out with him .::::seen
`` A fellow of that kind <<target>> in a very hard position .::::is
You must remember that for the <<target>> itself he cares nothing .::::truth
He finds a charm rather in <<target>> romantic beauty of a lie .::::the
Lax is to him a lovely object , even though he <<target>> aware that he and Lax be on different sides .::::be
And then he thoroughly believes in Lax ; thinks that Lax possesses some mysterious power <<target>> knowing what is in his mind , and of punishing him for his enmity .::::of
All the want of evidence in this <<target>> comes from belief in the marvellous .::::country
The people think that their very thoughts are known to men who make their name conspicuous , <<target>> dare not say a word which they suppose that it is desired they shall withhold .::::and
In this case Peter no doubt is on our side , and would gladly <<target>> Lax with his own hand if he were sure he would be safe .::::hang
But Lax is a mysterious tyrant , who in his imagination can slaughter him <<target>> day ; whereas he knows that he shall encounter no harm from you .::::any
He and poor Florian were sitting on the car with their backs turned to the embrasure ; and Peter 's attention was given <<target>> the driving of the car , -- so that there was no ground for thinking that he had seen the murderer .::::to
All the circumstances of the <<target>> ran the other way .::::moment
But still it <<target>> possible . ''::::was
And Captain Clayton was of opinion that Peter was beginning to <<target>> moved from the determined know-nothingness of his primary evidence .::::be
He had seen <<target>> flash .::::the
In this condition stood Captain Clayton 's mind in regard to Peter , when he heard , <<target>> the first time , a word about the widow Dolan and the widow Dolan 's daughter .::::for
The woman swore by all her gods <<target>> she knew nothing of Lax .::::that
But then she had already fallen into the difficulty <<target>> having been selected as capable of giving evidence .::::of
It generally happens that no one first person will be found even to indicate <<target>> , so that there is no finding a beginning to the case .::::others
But when a witness has been <<target>> , the witness must speak .::::indicated
`` The big <<target>> ! ''::::blackguard
exclaimed Mrs. Dolan , when she heard of the evil that had been <<target>> her ; `` to have the imperence to mention my name ! ''::::brought
It was felt , all the country through , to be an impertinence , -- for anybody to drag anybody <<target>> into the mess of troubles which was sure to arise from an enforced connection with a law court .::::else
Most unwillingly the circumstances were drawn from Mrs. Dolan , and <<target>> extreme difficulty also from that ingenious young lady her daughter .::::with
But , still , it was made to appear that Lax had taken refuge in their cottage , and <<target>> gone down from thence to a little brook , where he effected the cleansing of his pistol .::::had
The young lady had done all in her power to keep her mother silent , but <<target>> mother had at last been tempted to speak of the weapon which Lax had used .::::the
Now there was no further question of <<target>> Lax go loose from prison !::::letting
But he did urge , with all that benevolence for which he was <<target>> , that the trial should come on at that immediate spring assizes .::::conspicuous
A rumour had , however , already reached the ears of Captain Clayton , and others <<target>> his position , that a great alteration was to be effected in the law .::::in
Therefore the trial was postponed ; -- not , indeed , with outspoken reference <<target>> to the new measure , but with much confidence in its resources .::::as
It would be useless here to refer to that Bill which was to have been passed for trying certain prisoners in Ireland without the intervention of a jury , and of the <<target>> which took place in it empowering the Government to alter the venue , and to submit such cases to a selected judge , to selected juries , to selected counties .::::alteration
The Irish judges had remonstrated against the first measure , and the second was to be first <<target>> , so that should it fail the judges might yet be called upon to act .::::tried
Such was the law under which criminals were tried in 1882 , and the <<target>> capital convictions were made under which the country began to breathe freely .::::first
But the tidings of the law had got abroad beforehand , and <<target>> a hope of triumph to such men as Captain Clayton .::::gave
Let a man undertake what duty he will in life , if he be a good man <<target>> will desire success ; and if he be a brave man he will long for victory .::::he
The presence of such a man as Lax in the country was an <<target>> to Captain Clayton , which it was his primary duty to remove .::::eyesore
And it was a triumph to him now that the <<target>> had come in which he might remove him .::::time
Three times had Mr. Lax fired at the Captain 's <<target>> , and three times had the Captain escaped .::::head
`` I think he has done with his guns and his <<target>> now , '' said Captain Clayton , in his triumph .::::pistols
`` I am not quite sure about Peter <<target>> , '' said Clayton to Mr. Jones .::::yet
`` But if we could look into his very soul I <<target>> afraid he could not do much for us . ''::::am
`` I never believed in Peter as <<target>> witness , '' replied Mr. Jones .::::a
But I think that young lady crept <<target>> and saw him cleaning his pistol .::::out
And I think that the old lady <<target>> a glimpse of the mask .::::had
I think that they can be <<target>> to say so . ''::::made
`` That will all be <<target>> , Mr. Jones .::::wanted
But I trust that we may <<target>> to summon you to Dublin .::::have
As things are at present , if Lax had been seen in broad daylight firing at <<target>> poor boy by a dozen farmers it would do no good in County Galway .::::the
There is Miss <<target>> out there .::::edith
She is awfully anxious about this <<target>> who destroyed her brother .::::wretch
I will go and <<target>> her . ''::::tell
So Captain Clayton rushed out , <<target>> for another cause for triumph .::::anxious
Mr. Jones had heard of his suit , and had heard also <<target>> the suit was made to Edith and not to Ada .::::that
`` There is not one in a dozen who would have taken Edith , '' said he <<target>> himself , -- '' unless it be one who saw her with my eyes . ''::::to
But yet he did not <<target>> of the marriage .::::approve
`` They were poverty stricken , '' he said , and Clayton <<target>> about from day to day with his life in his hand .::::went
`` A brave man , '' he said to himself ; `` but <<target>> foolhardy , -- unless it be that he wants to die . ''::::singularly
He had not been called upon for his <<target>> , for Edith had never yielded .::::consent
She , too , had <<target>> that it was impossible .::::said
`` If Ada would have suited , it might have <<target>> possible , but not between Yorke and me . ''::::been
They had both come now to call him by his Christian name ; and they to him were Ada <<target>> Edith ; but with their father he had never quite reached the familiarity of a Christian name .::::and
Mr. Jones had , in truth , been so saddened by the circumstances of the <<target>> two years that he could not endure the idea of marriages in his family .::::last
`` Of course , if you choose , my dear , you can <<target>> as you like , '' he used to say to Edith .::::do
`` What there are left of us <<target>> , I think , remain together .::::should
I suppose they can not turn <<target>> out of this house .::::me
The Prime Minister will hardly bring in a Bill that the estates bought <<target>> last hundred years shall belong to the owners of the next century .::::this
He can do so , of <<target>> , as things go now .::::course
There are no longer any lords to stop him , and the House of <<target>> , who want their seats , will do anything he bids them .::::commons
It 's the First Lieutenant who looks after Ireland , who has ideas of <<target>> with which the angels of light have certainly not filled his mind .::::justice
That we should get nothing from our purchased property this century , and give it <<target>> in the course of the next , is in strict accordance with his thinking .::::up
We can depend <<target>> nothing .::::upon
My brother-in-law can , of course , sell me out <<target>> day , and would not stop for a moment .::::any
But I think we should <<target>> ill all together .::::fare
Your brother is behaving nobly , and I <<target>> n't think we ought to desert him .::::do
Of course you can do <<target>> you please . ''::::as
Then the squire pottered on , wretched in heart ; or , rather , down in the mouth , as we <<target>> , and gave his advice to his younger daughter , not , in truth , knowing how her heart stood .::::say
_Equam memento rebus in arduis servare <<target>> , non secus ac bonis_ .::::mentem
If not , your thoughts will be too strongly coloured <<target>> your own misfortunes to allow of your advising others .::::by
The meaning of it had been brought <<target>> to her by her own light .::::home
But still she resolved that she <<target>> not marry Yorke Clayton .::::would
Yorke longed for her , more strongly <<target>> than for Lax , the murderer .::::even
For herself , when she would allow her thoughts to stray for a moment in <<target>> direction , all the bright azure tints of heaven were open to her .::::that
But she had made a mistake , <<target>> she did not deserve it .::::and
She had been a blind fool , and <<target>> fools deserved no azure tints of heaven .::::blind
If she could have had her own way she <<target>> still have married Ada to Yorke Clayton .::::would
When Ada told her that she had got over her <<target>> love , it was the mere babble of unselfishness .::::foolish
Edith was guilty here of the folly <<target>> judging of her sister as herself .::::of
And with Ada he would have such other gifts as so <<target>> a man as Yorke always desires in his wife .::::strong
In temper she was perfect ; <<target>> unselfishness she was excellent .::::in
In all those ways of giving aid , which some women possess and some not at all , -- but <<target>> , when possessed , go so far to make the comfort of a house , -- she was supreme .::::which
If a bedroom were untidy , <<target>> eye saw it at once .::::her
If a thing had to be done at the stroke of noon , she <<target>> remember that other things could not be done at the same time .::::would
If a man liked his egg half-boiled , she <<target>> bear it in her mind for ever .::::would
She would know the proper day for making this marmalade and that preserve ; and she <<target>> never lose her good looks for a moment when she was doing these things .::::would
With her little dusting-brush at her girdle , no eyes that <<target>> anything would ever take her for aught but a lady .::::knew
She was just the <<target>> for Yorke Clayton .::::wife
So Edith argued it in her own bosom , adding <<target>> wondrous mistakes to that first mistake she had made .::::other
In thinking of it all she counted herself for nothing , <<target>> made believe that she was ugly in all eyes .::::and
She would not allow the man to see as his fancy led him ; and could not bring herself to think that if <<target>> the man should change his mind and offer his hand to Ada , it would be impossible that Ada should accept it .::::now
Nor did she perceive that Ada had <<target>> suffered as she had suffered .::::not
`` I wanted to catch you just for one moment , '' <<target>> Yorke Clayton , running out so as to catch his prey .::::said
She had half wished to fly from him , and <<target>> half told herself that any such flight was foolish .::::had
`` I think , -- I do think that I <<target>> at last got Lax upon the hip . ''::::have
Are you going to turn <<target>> and be merciful ? ''::::round
He was her hero , and she certainly felt no mercy towards the murderer of her brother ; no mercy towards him who she <<target>> thought had planned all the injury done to her father ; no mercy towards him who had thrice fired at her beloved .::::now
This wretched man had struggled to get the blood of him who was all the world to her ; and had been urged <<target>> to his black deeds by no thought , by no feeling , that was not in itself as vile as hell !::::on
Lax was to her a viper so noxious as <<target>> be beyond the pale of all mercy .::::to
But she had said the word at the spur of the moment , because she had been instigated by her feelings to <<target>> her hero , and to contradict him , so that he might think that he was no hero of hers .::::gainsay
She looked at him for the moment , and said <<target>> , though he held her by the arm .::::nothing
`` If you say I am to spare <<target>> , I will spare him . ''::::him
`` Have I followed this <<target>> simply as a duty ?::::man
Have I lain awake thinking of it till I have given to <<target>> pursuit such an amount of energy as no duty can require ?::::the
Thrice he has endeavoured to kill me , firing at me in the dark , getting at me from behind hedges , as <<target>> one who has anything of the spirit of man in his bosom will do when he strives to destroy his enemy .::::no
All that has <<target>> nothing .::::been
I am a policeman in search of him , <<target>> am the natural enemy of a murderer .::::and
Of course in the ordinary way I would not have <<target>> him ; but the ordinary way would have sufficed .::::spared
Had he escaped me I could <<target>> laughed at all that .::::have
But he took that poor <<target>> 's life ! ''::::lad
Here he looked sadly into her face , and she <<target>> see that there was a tear within his eye .::::could
`` That was much , <<target>> that was not all .::::but
That lad was your brother , <<target>> whom you so dearly loved .::::him
He shot down the poor child before his father 's face , <<target>> because he had said that he would tell the truth .::::simply
When you wept , when you tore your hair , when you flung yourself in <<target>> upon the body , I told myself that either he or I must die .::::sorrow
And now you bid <<target>> be merciful . ''::::me
Then the big tears dropped down his cheeks , and he <<target>> to wail himself , -- hardly like a man .::::began
And what did <<target>> do ?::::edith
She stood and looked at him for a few moments ; then extricated herself from <<target>> hold he still had of her , and flung herself into his arms .::::the
Not once or twice was that kiss given ; but there <<target>> stood closely pressed to each other in a long embrace .::::they
`` My hero , '' she <<target>> ; `` my hero . ''::::said
It had all come at last , -- the double triumph ; and there <<target>> , he felt , no happier man in all Ireland than he .::::was
He thought , at least , that <<target>> double battle had been now won .::::the
But even yet it <<target>> not so .::::was
`` My brother Yorke , '' and <<target>> pressed both his hands in hers .::::she
`` You are no sister , nor <<target>> I ever be your brother .::::can
And he rushed at her again as though to envelop her <<target>> his arms , and to crush her against his bosom .::::in
she exclaimed , avoiding him with the activity <<target>> a young fawn ; `` not again .::::of
I had to beg your pardon , and <<target>> was so I did it . ''::::it
`` Twenty times you have offended me , and <<target>> times you must repeat your forgiveness . ''::::twenty
`` No , no , <<target>> must not be so .::::it
I was wrong to say <<target>> you were bloody-minded .::::that
`` But have you <<target>> me nothing ? ''::::told
`` Nay , Edith , <<target>> is more than that .::::it
She stood there blushing before him , over her cheeks and up <<target>> her forehead ; but yet did not turn away her face .::::to
`` How am I to tell you <<target>> it is more than that ?::::why
`` But , <<target>> -- ''::::edith
`` You can <<target>> tell me .::::not
There are moments for some of us the <<target>> of which can never be whispered .::::feelings

`` No , my enemy you can not be ; for him who is about <<target>> revenge my brother 's death no name less sweet than dearest friend will suffice .::::to
My hero and my <<target>> friend ! ''::::dearest
Then she took him by the hand , and turned away from the walk , and , escaping by a narrow <<target>> , was seen no more till she met him at dinner with her father and her brother and her sister .::::path
she shall be <<target>> ! ''::::mine
`` She must <<target>> mine ! ''::::be
And then he went within , and , finding Hunter , read the details of the evidence for <<target>> trial of Mr. Lax in Dublin , as prepared by the proper officers in Galway city .::::the
It will be well that they who are interested only in the sensational incidents of our story to skip this <<target>> and go on to other parts of our tale which may be more in accordance with their taste .::::chapter
It is necessary that this one chapter shall be written in which the accidents that occurred in <<target>> lives of our three heroines shall be made subordinate to the political circumstances of the day .::::the
This chapter should have been introductory and initiative ; but the facts as stated <<target>> suit better to the telling of my story if they be told here .::::will
There can be no doubt that Ireland has been and still is in a most precarious condition , that life has been <<target>> unsafe there , and that property has been jeopardised in a degree unknown for many years in the British Islands .::::altogether
It is , I think , the general opinion that these evils have been occasioned by the influx into Ireland of a feeling which I <<target>> not call American , but which has been engendered in America by Irish jealousy , and warmed into hatred by distance from English rule .::::will
As far as politics are regarded , Ireland has been the vassal of England as <<target>> has been of those masters under which she has been made to serve .::::poland
She was subjected to much ill-usage , and though she has readily accepted the language , the civilisation , and the customs of England , and has in fact grown rich by adopting them , the <<target>> of former hardships have clung to her , and have made her ready to receive willingly the teachings of those whose only object it has been to undermine the prestige of the British Empire .::::memories
In no respect has she more readily taken to her bosom English <<target>> than in that of the letting and the hiring of land .::::practices
In various countries , such as Italy , Russia , France , and the United <<target>> , systems have grown up different from that which has prevailed in England .::::states
Whether the English system or any other may <<target>> the best is not now the question .::::be
But in answering that question it is material to know that Ireland has accepted <<target>> , at any rate for two centuries , has followed that system .::::and
The landlord has been to his tenants a beneficent or , occasionally , a hard master , and the <<target>> have acknowledged themselves as dependent , generally with much affection , though not unfrequently with loud complaint .::::tenants
It has been the <<target>> in England .::::same
Questions of tenant-right , of leases , and of the cruelty <<target>> evictions have from time to time cropped up in Ireland .::::of
But rents were readily paid up to 1878 and 1879 ; though abatements were asked for , -- as was the case also in England ; and there were men ready to tell <<target>> Irish from time to time , since the days of O'Connell downwards , that they were ill-treated in being kept out of their `` ould '' properties by the rightful owners .::::the
The true Fenian I take to be one desirous of opposing <<target>> power , by using a fulcrum placed on American soil .::::british
Smith O'Brien 's logic consisted in his assertion that if his country wished to <<target>> the British Crown , they could only do it by using hammers .::::hammer
Smith O'Brien achieved little beyond his own exile ; -- but <<target>> words , acting upon his followers , produced Fenianism .::::his
That died away , but the spirit remained in America ; and when English tenants began to clamour for temporary abatements in their rent , the clamours were heard <<target>> the other side of the water , and assisted the views of those American-Irish who had revivified Ribandism and had given birth to the cry of Home Rule .::::on
During the time that this was going on , a long unflagging series of beneficial <<target>> of Parliament , and of consequently ameliorated circumstances , had befallen the country .::::acts
I was told the other day by an Irish Judge , whose name stands conspicuous among those who are known for their wisdom and their patriotism , by a Roman Catholic Judge too , that in studying the latter laws <<target>> the two countries , the laws affecting England and Ireland in reference to each other , he knew no law by which England was specially favoured , though he knew various laws redounding to the benefit of Ireland .::::of
When the cry for some relief to suffering Ireland came up , at the time of the Duchess of Marlborough 's Fund , <<target>> was alleged in proof of Ireland 's poor condition that there was not work by which the labourers could earn wages .::::it
I have known Ireland for more than forty <<target>> , -- say from 1842 to 1882 .::::years
In 1842 we paid five shillings a week <<target>> the entire work of a man .::::for
The question is not whether five shillings was sufficient , or whether nine be insufficient , but that the <<target>> increase through the country has been and can be proved to be such as is here declared .::::normal
I will refer to the banks , which can now be found established <<target>> any little town , almost in any village , through the country .::::in
Fifty years ago they <<target>> very much rarer .::::were
Banks do not spring up <<target>> money to support them .::::without
The increase of wages , -- and the banks also in an indirect manner , -- <<target>> come from that decrease in the population which followed the potato famine of 1846 .::::have
The famine and its results were terrible while they lasted ; <<target>> they left behind them an amended state of things .::::but
When man has failed to rule the world rightly , God will step in , and will cause <<target>> , and plagues , and pestilence -- even poverty itself -- with His own Right Arm .::::famines
But the cure was effected , and the country was on its road to a fair amount <<target>> prosperity , when the tocsin was sounded in America , and Home Rule became the cry .::::of
Ireland has lain as it <<target>> between two rich countries .::::were
England , her near neighbour , abounds in coal and iron , <<target>> has by means of these possessions become rich among the nations .::::and
America , very much the more distant , has by her <<target>> agricultural resources put herself in the way to equal England .::::unexampled
This is here stated as a fact , and I add my <<target>> opinion that it is equally necessary for Ireland 's welfare .::::own
But on this subject there has arisen a feud which is now being fought out by all the weapons of rebellion on one side , and on <<target>> other by the force of a dominating Government , restrained , as it is found to be , by the self-imposed bonds of a democratic legislature .::::the
But there is the feud , and the battle , <<target>> the roaring of the cannons is heard afar off .::::and
I now purpose to describe in a very <<target>> words the nature of the warfare .::::few
It may be said that the existence of Ireland as a <<target>> of England depends on the tenure of the land .::::province
If the land were to be taken altogether from the present owners , and divided in perpetuity among any possible number of tenants , so as to be the property of each tenant , without payment of any rent , all England 's sense of justice would be outraged , the English <<target>> of governing would be destroyed , and all that could then be done by England would be to give a refuge to the present owners till the time should come for righting themselves , and they should be enabled to make some further attempt for the recovery of their possessions .::::power
This would probably arrive , if not sooner , from the annihilation of the new proprietors <<target>> the hands of their fellow-countrymen to whom none of the spoil had been awarded .::::under
But English statesmen , -- a small portion , that is , of English statesmen , -- have wished in their philanthropy to devise some measure which might satisfy the present tenants of the land , giving them a portion of the <<target>> ; and might leave the landlords contented , -- not indeed with their lot , which they would feel to be one of cruel deprivation , but with the feeling that something had at any rate been left to them .::::spoil
A compromise would be thus effected between the two classes whose interests have always been opposed to each <<target>> since the world began , -- between the owners of property and those who have owned none .::::other
The statesmen in question have now come into power by means of <<target>> philanthropy , their undoubted genius , and great gifts of eloquence .::::their
They have almost talked the world out <<target>> its power of sober judgment .::::of
I hold that they have so succeeded in <<target>> to the present House of Commons .::::talking
And when the House of Commons has been so talked into any wise or foolish decision , <<target>> House of Lords and the whole legislating machinery of the country is bound to follow .::::the
But how should their <<target>> be effected ?::::compromises
It does not suit the present <<target>> to name any individual statesman .::::writer
But to the Liberal statesmen of the day , men in speaking well of whom -- at a great <<target>> -- he has spent a long life , he is now bound to express himself as opposed .::::distance
We all remember the manner after which <<target>> Coercion Bill of 1881 was passed .::::the
The hoarse shrieks with which a score of Irish members ran out of the House crying `` Privilege , '' when their <<target>> had been stopped by the salutary but certainly unconstitutional word of the Speaker , is still ringing in our ears .::::voices
Then the Government and the Irish score <<target>> at daggers-drawn with each other .::::were
To sit for thirty-six hours endeavouring to pass a clause was <<target>> held by all men to be an odious bondage .::::then
But when these clauses had thus roughly been made to be the law , <<target>> sugar-plum was to follow by which all Ireland was to be appeased .::::the
The second Bill of 1881 was passed , which , with various <<target>> , has given rise to Judge O'Hagan 's Land Court .::::additions
That , with its various sub-commissioners , is now engaged in <<target>> at what rate land shall be let in Ireland .::::settling
That Judge O'Hagan and his fellow commissioners are well qualified to perform their task , -- as well qualified , that is , <<target>> kindness , by legal knowledge and general sagacity as any men can be , -- I have heard no one deny .::::by
In the performance of most difficult duties <<target>> have hitherto encountered no censure .::::they
But they have , I think , been taxed to <<target>> duties beyond the reach of any mortal wisdom .::::perform
They are expected to do that which all the world has hitherto failed in doing , -- <<target>> do that against which the commonest proverbs of ancient and modern wisdom have raised their voice .::::to
There is no proverb more common than <<target>> of `` _caveat emptor_ . ''::::that
It is Judge O'Hagan 's business to do for the poorer party in each bargain <<target>> between a landlord and a tenant that against which the above proverb warns him .::::made
The landlord has declared that the tenant shall not have the <<target>> unless he will pay Â£10 a year for it .::::land
Then comes Judge O'Hagan and tells the two contracting parties to take up their <<target>> quickly and write down Â£8 as the fair rent payable for the land .::::pens
And it was with the object of doing this , of <<target>> every Â£10 by some percentage , twenty per cent .::::reducing
or otherwise , that <<target>> commission was appointed .::::this
The Government had taken upon itself to say that the greed of Irish landlords had been too <<target>> , and the softness of Irish tenants too soft , and that therefore Parliament must interfere .::::greedy
Parliament has interfered , and Â£8 is to be written down for a term of years in lieu of Â£10 , and the <<target>> is to become the possession of the tenant instead of the landlord as long as he may pay this reduced rent .::::land
In fact all the bonds which have bound the <<target>> to his land are to be annihilated .::::landlord
So also are the bonds which bind the tenant , who will sell the property so acquired when he shall <<target>> found that that for which he pays Â£8 per annum shall have become worth Â£10 in the market .::::have
It is useless to argue with the commissioners , or with the Government , as to the inexpediency of such <<target>> attempt to alter the laws for governing the world , which have forced themselves on the world 's acceptance .::::an
Many such attempts have been <<target>> to alter these laws .::::made
The Romans said that <<target>> per cent .::::twelve
should be the <<target>> for money .::::interest
A feeling long prevailed in England that legitimate <<target>> should not exceed five per cent .::::interest
The usurer is hated , and the hands <<target>> the honest men are against him .::::of
That suffices to give the borrower <<target>> protection as is needed .::::such
So it is with <<target>> and tenants .::::landlords
Injury is no doubt done , and injustice <<target>> enabled to prevail here and there .::::is
But it is the lesser injury , the lesser injustice , which can not be prevented <<target>> the long run by any attempt to escape the law of `` _caveat emptor_ . ''::::in
It is , however , vain to talk to benevolent commissioners , or to <<target>> Government working by eloquence and guided by philanthropy , regardless of political economy .::::a
`` Would you have the heart , '' asks the benevolent commissioner , `` to evict the poor man from his small holding on which he has lived all <<target>> life , where his only sympathies lie , and send him abroad to a distant land , where his solitary tie will be that of labour ? ''::::his
The benevolent commissioner thus expresses with great talk and with something also of the <<target>> of his employers the feeling which prevails on that side of the question .::::eloquence
But that which he deprecates is just what I could do ; and having seen many Irishmen both in <<target>> and in Ireland , I know that the American Irishman is the happiest man of the two .::::america
He eats more ; and in much <<target>> the happiness of mankind depends greatly .::::eating
He is better clothed , better <<target>> , and better instructed .::::sheltered
Though his women wail when he departs , <<target>> sends home money to fetch them .::::he
This may be for <<target>> profit of America .::::the
There are many who think that it must <<target>> be to the injury of England .::::therefore
The question now is whether the pathetic remonstrance of <<target>> tear-laden commissioner should be allowed to prevail .::::the
I say that the tenant who undertakes to pay for land that which the land <<target>> not enable him to pay had better go , -- under whatever pressure .::::will
Let us see how many details , how many improbabilities , will have to <<target>> met before the benevolence of the commissioner can be made to prevail .::::be
The reductions made on the rent average <<target>> between twenty and twenty-five per cent .::::something
Let us take <<target>> at twenty .::::them
If a tenant has to be evicted for a demand of Â£10 , <<target>> he be able to live in comfort if he pay only Â£8 ?::::will
Shall one tenant live in comfort on a farm , the rent of which has been reduced <<target>> from Â£100 to Â£80 , and another , the reduction having been from Â£20 to Â£16 ?::::him
In either case , if a tenant shall do well with <<target>> children , how shall he do with six or eight ?::::two
A true teetotaller can certainly pay double the rent <<target>> may be extracted from a man who drinks .::::which
Shall the normal tenant earn wages beyond what he <<target>> from the land under his own tillage ?::::gets
Shall the idle man be made equal to the industrious , -- or can <<target>> be done , or should it be done , by any philanthropy ?::::this
Statesmen sitting together in a cabinet may resolve that they will set the world right by eloquence and benevolence combined ; <<target>> the practices to which the world have been brought by long experience will avail more than eloquence and benevolence .::::but
Statesmen may decree that land shall be let at a certain <<target>> , and the decree will prevail for a time .::::rate
It may prevail long enough to put out of gear the present <<target>> of the Irish world with which these statesmen will have tampered .::::affairs
But the long experience will come back , and bargains will again be <<target>> between man and man , though the intervening injuries will be heartbreaking .::::made
But the benevolence of the Government and <<target>> commissioners will not have gone far .::::its
The Land Law of 1881 has , as I now write , been at <<target>> for twelve months , and the results hitherto accomplished have been very small .::::work
The commissioners work slowly , having all the skill of the <<target>> , on one side or the other , against them .::::lawyers
It is piteous to see the hopelessness of three sub-commissioners <<target>> the midst of a crowd of Irish attorneys .::::in
And the law , as it exists at present , can be <<target>> to act only on holdings possessed by tenants for one year .::::made
The possession of a lease , which used to be regarded as a safeguard and permanent blessing to the tenant , is now held to <<target>> cruelly detrimental to him , as preventing the lowering of his rent , and the immediate creation for him of a tenancy for ever .::::be
It is not to be supposed that the sub-commissioners can walk over the land and straightway reduce the <<target>> , though the lands would certainly be subject to such reduction did not the law interfere .::::rents
The landlord is willing to <<target>> twenty per cent .::::lose
in fear of something worse , and the tenant is willing <<target>> take it , hardly daring to hope for anything better .::::to
Such is the best condition which <<target>> law has ventured to anticipate .::::the
But in either case this is to be done <<target>> tempering the wind to the shorn lamb .::::as
The landlord is anxious if possible to save for himself and those who may come after him something of the reality of his property , and the tenant feels that , though <<target>> of the nobility of property has been promised to him by the Landleaguers , he may after all make the best bargain by so far submitting himself to his shorn landlord .::::something
But on estates where the commissioners are allowed their full swing , <<target>> whole nature of the property in the land will be altered .::::the
The present tenant , paying a tax of Â£8 per annum which will be subjected to no reduction and <<target>> which no abatement can be made , in lieu of a Â£10 rent , will be the owner .::::on
The small man will be infinitely more subject to disturbance <<target>> at present , because the tax must be paid .::::than
The landlord will feel no mercy for him , seeing that <<target>> bonds between them which demanded mercy have been abrogated .::::the
The extra Â£2 or Â£4 or Â£6 will not enable the tenant <<target>> live the life of ease which he will have promised himself .::::to
If his interest has been made to be worth anything , -- and it will be worth something , seeing that it has <<target>> worth something , and is saleable under its present condition , -- it will be sold , and the emigration will continue .::::been
There are cruel <<target>> at present .::::cases
But the time selected for <<target>> measure was most inappropriate .::::the
If good in itself , it was <<target>> at the time it was passed .::::bad
Home Rule coming across to us from <<target>> had taken the guise of rebellion .::::america
I have met gentlemen who , as Home-Rulers , have simply desired to obtain <<target>> their country an increase of power in the management of their own affairs .::::for
These men have been loyal and patriotic , and <<target>> might perhaps be well to meet their views .::::it
The Channel no doubt does make <<target>> difference between Liverpool and Dublin .::::a
That they should not succeed in doing this is the determination of <<target>> , at any rate on this side of the Channel .::::all
It is still , I believe , the desire <<target>> most thinking men on the Irish side .::::of
But parliamentary votes are not given only to thinking men ; and consequently a body of members has appeared in the House , energetic and <<target>> well trained , who have resolved by the clamour of their voices to put an end to the British power of governing the country .::::now
England is still writhing in her attempt <<target>> invent some mode of controlling them .::::to
As to the first , it will , of course , be admitted by all men that <<target>> should be fair , as also should be the price at which a horse is sold .::::rents
It is , however , beyond the power of <<target>> to settle the terms which shall be fair .::::parliament
`` _Caveat emptor_ '' is the only rule <<target>> which fair rents may be reached .::::by
By fixity of tenure is meant such a holding of the land as shall enable the tenant to obtain an adequate return for his labour and his capital , and to this is added <<target>> romantic and consequently a most unjust idea that it may be well to settle this question on behalf of the tenant by granting him such a term as shall leave no doubt .::::a
Let him have the land for ever as long as he will pay a <<target>> sum , which shall be considerably less than the landlord 's demand .::::stipulated
Freedom of sale is necessarily <<target>> to fixity of tenure .::::annexed
If a man is to have the possession of land in <<target>> , surely he should be allowed to sell it .::::perpetuity
Whether he be allowed or not , <<target>> will contrive to do so .::::he
Freedom of sale means , I take it , that the so-called <<target>> shall have no power of putting a veto on the transaction .::::landlord
We can not here go into the whole question as it existed in Ulster before 1870 ; <<target>> the freedom of sale intended is such , I think , as I have defined it .::::but
They seem to me to <<target>> to wholesale confiscation .::::amount
But supposing me to be wrong in that , can I be wrong in <<target>> that a period of declared rebellion is not a time for concessions ?::::thinking
When the Land Bill was passed the Landleague was in full power ; boycotting had become the recognised weapon of an illegal association ; and the Home-Rulers of the day , -- the <<target>> , that is , who represented the Landleague , -- were already in such possession of large portions of the country as to prevent the possibility of carrying out the laws .::::party
At this moment the Government brought forward its romantic theory as to the manipulation of land , and , before that theory was at work , commenced its benevolent intentions <<target>> locking up all those who were supposed to be guilty of an intention to carry out the Government project further than the Government would carry it out itself .::::by
It is held , as a rule , in politics <<target>> coercion and concession can not be applied together .::::that
Ireland was in mutiny under the guidance of a mutinous party in the House of Commons , and at that moment a commission was put in operation , under which <<target>> was the intention of the Government to transfer the soil of the country at a reduced price to the very men among whom the mutineers are to be found .::::it
How do the tidings of such a commission <<target>> upon the ears of Irishmen at large ?::::operate
He is told that under the fear of the Landleague his rent is to be reduced to an extent which is <<target>> to his imagination ; and then , that he is to be freed altogether from the incubus of a landlord !::::left
He is , in fact , made to <<target>> that his cherished Landleague has become all-powerful .::::understand
Demanding concessions , and the continued increase of them , and having learned the way <<target>> seize upon them when they are not given , he will not stand coercion .::::to
Abated rent soon <<target>> no rent .::::becomes
When it is left to the payer of the rent to decide on which <<target>> he will act , it is probable that the no-rent theory will prevail .::::system
So it was <<target>> 1882 .::::in
Tenants were harassed by needy landlords , and when they were served with forms of ejectment the <<target>> were simply murdered , either in their own persons or in that of their servants .::::landlords
Men finding their power , and beginning to learn how much might be <<target>> from a yielding Government , hardly knew how to moderate their aspirations .::::exacted
When they found that the expected results did not <<target>> at once , they resorted to revenge .::::come
Why should these tyrants keep them out from the good things which their American <<target>> had promised them , and which were so close within their grasp ?::::friends
And their anger turned not only against their landlords , but against those who <<target>> seem in any way to be fighting on the landlords ' side .::::might
Did a neighbour occupy a field from which a Landleaguing tenant had been evicted , let the tails of that neighbour 's <<target>> be cut off , or the legs broken of his beasts of burden , or his sheep have their throats cut .::::cattle
Or if the injured one have some scruples of conscience , let the oppressor <<target>> be boycotted , and put out of all intercourse with his brother men .::::simply
Let no well-intentioned Landleaguing neighbour buy from him a ton of <<target>> , or sell to him a loaf of bread .::::hay
But as a last resource , if all <<target>> fail , let the sinner be murdered .::::others
in how many cases the sentence has been pronounced <<target>> the judgment given , and the punishment executed .::::and
Such have been the results of <<target>> Land Law passed in 1881 .::::the
And under the curse so engendered <<target>> country is now labouring .::::the
It can not be denied that the promoters of the Land Laws <<target>> weak , and that the disciples of the Landleague are strong .::::are
In order that the truth of this may be seen <<target>> made apparent , the present story is told .::::and
Poor Mr. O'Mahony had <<target>> on every side .::::enemies
There had come up lately a state of things <<target>> must be very common in political life .::::which
The hatreds which sound so real when you read the mere words , which look so true when you see their <<target>> attitudes , on which for the time you are inclined to pin your faith so implicitly , amount to nothing .::::scornful
The Right Honourable A. has to do business with the Honourable B. , and can best carry it on by loud expressions and strong arguments such as will be palatable to readers of <<target>> ; but they do not hate each other as the readers of the papers hate them , and are ready enough to come to terms , if coming to terms is required .::::newspapers
Each of them respects the other , though each <<target>> them is very careful to hide his respect .::::of
We can fancy that the Right Honourable A. and the Honourable B. in their moments <<target>> confidential intercourse laugh in their joint sleeves at the antipathies of the public .::::of
In the present instance it was alleged that the Right Honourable A. and the Honourable B. had come <<target>> some truce together , and had ceased for a while to hit each other hard knocks .::::to
Such a truce was supposed to be a feather in the cap of the Honourable B. , as he was leader of a <<target>> party of no more than twenty ; and the Right Honourable A. had in this matter the whole House at his back .::::poor
But Mr. O'Mahony would <<target>> no peace .::::have
He understood nothing <<target>> compromises .::::of
He really believed that the Right Honourable gentleman was <<target>> fiend which the others had only called him .::::the
To him it was a <<target>> with the very devil .::::compact
Now the leader of his party , knowing better what he was about , and understanding somewhat of the manner in <<target>> politics are at present carried on , felt himself embarrassed by the honesty of such a follower as Mr. O'Mahony .::::which
Mr. O'Mahony , when he was asked whether he wished to lead or <<target>> willing to serve , declared that he would neither lead nor serve .::::was
And he was sure that that was not to <<target>> obtained by friendship with Her Majesty 's Government .::::be
This was in itself very well , but he was soon informed that it <<target>> not as a free-lance that he had been elected member for Cavan .::::was
`` That is between me and my constituency , '' said Mr. O'Mahony , standing <<target>> with his head thrown back , and his right hand on his heart .::::up
But the constituency soon gave him to understand that he <<target>> not the man they had taken him to be .::::was
He , too , had begun to find that to spend his daughter 's money <<target>> acting patriotism in the House of Commons was not a fine _rÃ´le_ in life .::::in
He earned nothing and <<target>> did nothing .::::he
Unless he could bind himself hand and foot to his <<target>> he had not even a spark of delegated power .::::party
He was not allowed to be wrathful with true indignation , not for a moment ; but he was expected to be there from question time through the long watches of the night -- taking , indeed , his turn for rest <<target>> food -- always ready with some mock indignation by which his very soul was fretted ; and no one paid him the slightest respect , though he was , indeed , by no means the least respectable of his party .::::and
He would have done true work had <<target>> been given him to do .::::it
But at the present moment his own <<target>> did not believe in him .::::party
There was no need at <<target>> for independent wrathful eloquence .::::present
There seldom is need in the <<target>> of Commons for independent eloquence .::::house
Mr. O'Mahony had never served anyone for an hour , and was as thin-skinned as a young girl ; and , though his daughter had handed him all her <<target>> , so that he might draw upon it as he pleased , he told himself , and told her also , that his doing so was mean .::::money
`` You 're welcome to every dollar , father , <<target>> it does n't seem to make you happy . ''::::only
`` I should be happy to starve for the <<target>> , if starving would do anything . ''::::country
`` I do n't see that one ever does any good <<target>> starving as long as there is bread to eat .::::by
This is n't a romantic sort of thing , this payment of rents ; <<target>> we ought to try and find out what a man really owes . ''::::but
`` No man owes a cent to <<target>> landlord on behalf of rent . ''::::any
`` But how is a man <<target>> get the land ? ''::::to
`` Over in our country a rough pioneering fellow goes and buys it , and then he <<target>> it , and of course the man who buys it has n't to pay rent .::::sells
But I can not see how any fellow here can <<target>> a right to the land for nothing . ''::::have
Then Mr. O'Mahony reminded his daughter that she <<target>> ill and should not exert herself .::::was
It was now far advanced in May , and Mr. O'Mahony had resolved to make one <<target>> eloquent speech in the House of Commons and then to retire to the United States .::::crushing
But he had already learned that even this could <<target>> be effected without the overcoming of many difficulties .::::not
In himself , in his eloquence , in the supply of words , he trusted altogether ; but there was the opportunity to be bought , and the Speaker 's eye to be found , -- he regarded this Speaker 's eye as the most false of all luminaries , -- and the empty benches to be encountered , and then drowsy <<target>> to be stirred up ; and then on the next morning , -- if any next morning should come for such a report , -- there would not be a tithe of what he had spoken to be read by any man , and , in truth , very little of what he could speak would be worthy of reading .::::reporters
His words would be honest and indignant and fine-sounding , but the hearer <<target>> be sure to say , `` What a fool is that Mr .::::would
At any rate , he understood so much of all this that he was determined to <<target>> the Chiltern Hundreds and flee away as soon as his speech should be made .::::accept
It was far advanced in May , and poor Rachel was still very ill. She was so ill <<target>> all hope had abandoned her either as to her profession or as to either of her lovers .::::that
But there was some spirit in her still , as <<target>> she would discuss with her father her future projects .::::when
`` Let me go back , '' she said , `` <<target>> sing little songs for children in that milder climate .::::and
The climate is mild down in the South , and there I <<target>> , perhaps , find some fragment of my voice . ''::::may
But he who was becoming so despondent both for himself and <<target>> his country , still had hopes as to his daughter .::::for
Her engagement with Lord Castlewell <<target>> not even yet broken .::::was
Lord Castlewell had gone out of town at a most unusual period , -- at a time when the theatres <<target>> knew him , and had been away on the exact day which had been fixed for their marriage .::::always
Rachel had done all that lay in herself to disturb the marriage , but Lord Castlewell <<target>> held to it , urged by feelings which he had found it difficult to analyse .::::had
Rachel had in her sickness determined to have done with him <<target>> , but latterly she had had no communication with him .::::altogether
She had spoken of him to her father as <<target>> he were a being simply to be forgotten .::::though
`` He has gone away , and , as far as <<target>> is concerned , there is an end of me .::::he
It could not have <<target>> better . ''::::finished
But her mind still referred to Frank Jones , and <<target>> him she had received hardly a word of love .::::from
Further words of love she <<target>> not send him .::::could
During her illness many letters , or little notes rather , had been written to Castle <<target>> on her behalf by her father , and to these there had come replies .::::morony
Frank was so anxious to <<target>> of her well-doing .::::hear
Frank had not cared so much for <<target>> voice as for her general health .::::her
Frank was so sorry to <<target>> of her weakness .::::hear
It had all been read to her , but as it had been read she had <<target>> shaken her head ; and her father had not carried the dream on any further .::::only
To his thinking she was still engaged to the lord , and <<target>> would be better for her that she should marry the lord .::::it
The lord no doubt was a fool , and filled the most foolish <<target>> in the world , -- that of a silly fainÃ©ant earl .::::place
But he would do no harm to his daughter , and the girl <<target>> learn to like the kind of life which would be hers .::::would
By the treasury of the theatre <<target>> had been treated munificently .::::she
Her engagement had been almost up to the day fixed for her marriage , and the <<target>> which would have become due to her under it had been paid in full .::::money
She had sent back the latter payments , but they had <<target>> returned to her with the affectionate respects of the managers .::::been
Since she had put her foot upon these boards she <<target>> found herself to be popular with all around her .::::had
That , she had told herself , had been due <<target>> the lord who was to become her husband .::::to
But Rachel had become , and was likely to become , the <<target>> of earning money for them , and they were grateful .::::means
To tell the truth , Lord Castlewell <<target>> had nothing to do with it .::::had
But gradually there came upon them the conviction that her voice <<target>> gone , and then the payment of the money ceased .::::was
She , and the doctor , and her father , had discussed it <<target>> , and they had agreed to settle that it must be so .::::together
If it had been small-pox , or anything in <<target>> way , I could have borne it .::::that
But this thing , <<target>> terrible misfortune ! ''::::this
Then she laughed , and then burst out sobbing <<target>> loud tears , and hid her face .::::with
`` You will be married , and still <<target>> happy , '' said the doctor .::::be
So much you <<target>> about it .::::know
Am I ever to get strong in my limbs again , so as to <<target>> able to cross the water and go back to my own country ? ''::::be
Here the doctor assured her that she would be able to <<target>> back to her own country , if it were needed .::::go
`` Father , '' she said , as soon as the doctor had left <<target>> , `` let there be an end to all this about Lord Castlewell .::::her
I will not <<target>> him . ''::::marry
`` But , <<target>> dear ! ''::::my

There are two reasons <<target>> I should not .::::why

You had better take me back <<target>> the States at once . ''::::to
`` Good-bye , Rachel , '' said the lord , <<target>> into her room the day but one after this .::::coming

I did believe in my voice myself , and <<target>> I felt myself fitting to marry you .::::therefore

Of course he 's handsome , <<target>> strong , and brave .::::and

He would not have another shirt <<target>> be washed with my money .::::to
Oh , that the chance were given to me to go <<target>> wash it for him with my own hands ! ''::::and
Lord Castlewell sat through the interview somewhat distraught , as well he might be ; but when it was over , and he had taken his leave <<target>> kissed her forehead , as he went home in his cab , he told himself that he had got through that little adventure very well .::::and
She had in the morning gone <<target>> a good deal of work .::::through
She had in the first <<target>> counted her money .::::place
She had something over Â£600 at the bank , and she <<target>> always supplied her father with what he had wanted .::::had
She had told her future husband that she must sing one month in the year so as to earn what <<target>> be necessary for the support of the Member of Parliament , and singularly enough her father had yielded .::::would
But now the six hundred and odd pounds was all that <<target>> left to take them both back to the United States .::::was

Rachel had dismissed her brougham , and <<target>> had written to Edith Jones .::::she
That , no doubt , had been <<target>> greatest effort of the morning .::::the
We need not give here the body of her letter , but it may be <<target>> that she simply declared at length the nature of the prospect before her .::::understood
There was not a word <<target>> Frank Jones in it .::::of
She had done that before , <<target>> Frank Jones had not responded .::::and
She intended to go with her father direct from Liverpool to New <<target>> , and her letter was full chiefly of affectionate farewells .::::york
To Edith and to Ada and to their <<target>> there were a thousand written kisses sent .::::father
But there was not <<target>> kiss for Frank .::::a
There was not a word for Frank , so that any reader of the letter , knowing there was a <<target>> in the family , would have missed the mention of him , and asked why it was so .::::frank
It was very , very bitter to poor Rachel this writing to Morony Castle without an allusion to the man ; but , as she had said , he had been right not <<target>> come and live on her wages , and he certainly was right not to say a word as to their loss , when neither of them had wages on which to live .::::to
It would have suited in the United States , but she knew that it would not suit here in the old <<target>> , and therefore when the letter was written she was sitting worn-out , jaded and unhappy in her own bed-room .::::country
The lodging was still in Cecil Street , from which spot she and her father had determined not to move themselves till after <<target>> marriage , and had now resolved to remain there till Rachel should be well enough for her journey to New York .::::the
As she sat there the servant , whom in her later richer days <<target>> had taken to herself , came to her and announced a visitor .::::she
Mr. Moss was <<target>> the sitting-room .::::in
`` Mr. Moss <<target>> ! ''::::here
The girl declared that he was in the sitting-room , and <<target>> answer to further inquiries alleged that he was alone .::::in
How he had got there <<target>> girl could not say .::::the
Probably somebody had received <<target>> small bribe .::::a
Rachel told the girl to be ready when she was ready to accompany her into the parlour , <<target>> thus resolving that she would see Mr. Moss she sent him a message to this effect .::::and
Then she went to work and <<target>> her dressing very slowly .::::perfected
`` You be in the little room close at hand , '' she said , `` <<target>> have the door ajar , so that you can come to me if I call .::::and
So saying , she put on her best manners , as it might be those she had <<target>> from the earl when he was to be her husband , and walked into the room .::::learned
She had often told herself , since the old days , as she had now told the maid , <<target>> no real ground for suspicion existed ; and yet she knew that she did suspect the man .::::that
Rachel was pale and wan , and moved <<target>> slowly as though with haughty gesture .::::very
Mr. Moss , no doubt , had reason for knowing <<target>> the marriage with Lord Castlewell was at an end .::::that
The story had been told <<target>> among the theatres .::::about
Lord Castlewell did not mean to marry Miss O'Mahony ; or else the other <<target>> stranger story , Miss O'Mahony did not mean to marry Lord Castlewell .::::and
Theatrical people generally told it to <<target>> another as a poetical tale .::::one
The young lady had lost <<target>> voice and her beauty .::::her
The young lady was looking very <<target>> and could never sing again .::::old
It was absolutely impossible that in such circumstances she should <<target>> to marry the lord if he were willing .::::decline
But it was more than probable that <<target>> should decline to marry her .::::he
But that he should still want to marry the young lady , <<target>> that she should refuse , -- that was quite impossible .::::and
But Mr. Moss was somewhat different <<target>> the theatrical world in general .::::from
He kept himself to himself , and kept <<target>> opinion very much in the dark .::::his
Madame Socani spoke to him often about Rachel , and expressed <<target>> loud opinion that Lord Castlewell had never been in earnest .::::her
And she was of opinion that Rachel 's <<target>> had never had any staying property .::::voice
Once he did turn round and curse the <<target>> violently , but that was all .::::woman
Then , when the news had , he thought , been made certain , either <<target>> one direction or the other , he came and called on the young lady .::::in
`` Well , Mr. Moss , '' said the young lady , <<target>> a smile that was intended to be most contemptible and gracious .::::with
`` I have been so extremely sorry to hear <<target>> your illness , my dear young lady . ''::::of
Her grandeur departed from <<target>> all at once .::::her
To be called this man 's `` <<target>> young lady '' was insufferable .::::dear
And grandeur did not come easily to <<target>> , though wit and sarcasm did .::::her
`` Your dear young lady , as you please to call <<target>> , has had a bad time of it . ''::::her
`` In memory of the old days <<target>> called you so , Miss O'Mahony .::::i
You and I used to <<target>> thrown much together . ''::::be
`` You and I will never be thrown together <<target>> , as my singing is all over . ''::::again
`` It may be so <<target>> it may not . ''::::and
`` It is over , at any rate as far as the <<target>> theatres go , -- as far as you and I go .::::london
`` I hope <<target>> . ''::::not
`` I tell <<target>> it is .::::you
I am going back to New York at once , and do <<target>> think I shall sing another note as long as I live .::::not
`` Very well ; but at any <<target>> I must say good-bye to you .::::rate
I am very weak , and can not <<target>> much in the talking line . ''::::do
She was in truth weak , but she was <<target>> to stand there till he should have gone .::::minded
`` My dear Miss O'Mahony , if you would sit down for <<target>> moment , I have a proposition to make to you .::::a
I think that it is one to which <<target>> may be induced to listen . ''::::you
Then she did sit down , knowing that she <<target>> want the strength which rest would give her .::::would
The conversation with Mr. Moss <<target>> probably be prolonged .::::might
He also sat down at a little distance , and <<target>> his shining new hat dangling between his knees .::::held
It was part of her quarrel with him <<target>> he had always on a new hat .::::that
`` Your marriage with Lord Castlewell , <<target>> believe , is off . ''::::i

`` You have nothing , if <<target>> understand right , -- nothing !::::i
You have had a run for a few <<target>> , and have spent all your money .::::months
You have no theatre , -- <<target>> have one of my own .::::i
I am ready to take a house <<target>> furnish it just as you please .::::and
You are living here in <<target>> poor , wretched lodgings .::::these
Why do I <<target>> that ? ''::::do
And he put up <<target>> his hands .::::both
`` You never will do <<target>> , '' said Rachel .::::it
`` Because I <<target>> you . ''::::love
Then he threw away his new hat , <<target>> fell on his knees before her .::::and
If your voice comes <<target>> , -- well !::::back
If it do not come back , you will be my wife , <<target>> I shall do my best to keep you like a lady . ''::::and
Here Rachel leant back in her <<target>> , and shut her eyes .::::chair
In truth she was weak , and was hardly able <<target>> carry on the battle after her old fashion .::::to
And she had to bethink herself whether the <<target>> was making this offer in true faith .::::man
If so , there was something noble in it ; and , though she still hated the man , as a woman <<target>> hate her lover , she would in such case be bound not to insult him more than she could help .::::may
A softer feeling than usual came upon her , and she felt that he <<target>> be sufficiently punished if she could turn him instantly out of the room .::::would
But he was at her knees <<target>> the whole thing was abominable .::::and
`` Rachel , say the word , <<target>> be mine at once . ''::::and
`` You do not understand <<target>> I hate you ! ''::::how
`` Rachel , come <<target>> my arms ! ''::::to
Then he got up , as though <<target>> clasp the girl in his embrace .::::to
She ran from him , and immediately called the girl whom she <<target>> desired to remain in the next room with the door open .::::had
But the door was not open , and the girl , <<target>> she was in the room , did not answer .::::though
Probably the bribe which Mr. Moss had given <<target>> to her feeling rather larger than ordinary .::::was
`` My darling , my charmer , my <<target>> one , come to my arms ! ''::::own
She did save her face so that Mr. Moss could not kiss her , but <<target>> was knocked into a heap by his violence , and by her own weakness .::::she
He still had hold of her as she rose to her feet , and , though <<target>> had become acquainted with her weapon before , he certainly did not fear it now .::::he
When she got up she was <<target>> more in his power .::::still
She was astray , scrambling here and there , so <<target>> to be forced to guard against her own awkwardness .::::as
Whatever may be the position in which a woman may find herself , whatever battle she <<target>> have to carry on , she has first to protect herself from unseemly attitudes .::::may
Before she could do anything she had first to stand <<target>> her legs , and gather her dress around her .::::upon
`` My own one , my <<target>> , come to me ! ''::::life
he exclaimed , again attempting to <<target>> her into his embrace .::::get
But he had the <<target>> stuck into him .::::knife
He fell on the sofa , and clasped his <<target>> , where the weapon had struck him .::::side
She rang the bell violently , and , when the girl <<target>> , desired her to go at once for a surgeon .::::came
`` I never was such a fool as to <<target>> before , '' she told Frank afterwards .::::faint
`` I never <<target>> on fainting .::::counted
If a girl faints , of <<target>> she loses all her chance .::::course
It was because <<target>> was ill .::::i
But poor Mr. Moss had <<target>> worst of it . ''::::the
Rachel , from the moment in which she <<target>> , never saw Mr. Moss any more .::::fainted
Madame Socani came to visit her , and told her father , when she <<target>> to see her , that Mr. Moss had only three days to live .::::failed
Rachel was again in bed , and could <<target>> lift up her hands in despair .::::only
`` There was something about his eye which <<target>> me that an attempt would be made .::::told
He would not believe of a woman that <<target>> could have a will of her own .::::she
By treating her like an animal he <<target>> he would have his own way .::::thought
I do n't imagine he will treat <<target>> in that way again . ''::::me
And then she spoke <<target>> him to Frank .::::of
`` I suppose he <<target>> like me ? ''::::does
`` He likes your singing , -- <<target>> so much a month . ''::::at
`` That 's <<target>> done now .::::all
At any rate , he can not but <<target>> that it is an extreme chance .::::know
He must fancy that <<target>> really likes me .::::he
A man has to be forgiven <<target>> good deal for that .::::a
But a man must be made to understand that if <<target>> woman wo n't have him , she wo n't !::::a
I think Mr. Moss <<target>> it now . ''::::understands
These last words had been spoken after the coming of Frank Jones , but something has to be said of the <<target>> of his coming , and of the reasons which brought him , and something also which occurred before he came .::::manner
It could not be that Mr. Moss should be wounded after so desperate <<target>> fashion and that not a word should be said about it .::::a
Of what happened at the time <<target>> the wounding Rachel knew nothing .::::of
She had been very brave and high in courage till the thing was done , <<target>> as soon as it was done she sent for the servant and fainted away .::::but
She knew nothing of what had occurred till she had been removed out <<target>> the room on one side , and he on the other .::::of
He did bleed profusely , but under the aid of the doctor and Mr. O'Mahony , who was soon on the scene , he <<target>> himself more quickly than poor Rachel , who was indeed somewhat neglected till the hero of the tragedy had been sent away .::::recovered
He behaved with sufficient courage at last , though he <<target>> begun by declaring that his days were numbered .::::had
At any rate he had said when he found the power of ordinary speech , `` Do n't <<target>> a word be whispered about it to Miss O'Mahony ; she is n't like other people . ''::::let
Then he was taken back to his private lodging , and confided to the <<target>> of Madame Socani , where we will for the present leave him .::::care
Soon after the occurrence , -- a day or two after <<target>> , -- Frank Jones appeared suddenly on the scene .::::it
Of course it appeared that he had come <<target>> mourn the probable death of Mr. Moss .::::to
But he had in truth heard nothing of the fatal encounter till he had arrived in <<target>> Street , and then could hardly make out what had occurred amidst the confused utterances .::::cecil
`` Father , what has <<target>> him here ? ''::::brought
and she blushed up over her face and <<target>> to the very roots of her hair .::::head
`` Come up , of <<target>> he must come up .::::course
When a man has come all the way from <<target>> Morony he must be allowed to come up .::::castle
Why should you wish to keep <<target>> down in the area ? ''::::him
Then Frank Jones soon made <<target>> appearance within the chamber .::::his
On her head she wore a small net of the finest golden filigree , and <<target>> tiny feet were thrust into a pair of bright blue slippers bordered with swans-down .::::her
`` Am I to <<target>> back ? ''::::come
her obedient father <<target>> asked .::::had
But he had been told not to <<target>> back , not quite at present .::::come
So the father simply slapped him on the back , <<target>> bade him walk upstairs till he would find No .::::and
15 on the <<target>> landing .::::second
`` Of course you have heard , '' he said , as Frank was <<target>> , `` of what she has been and done to Mahomet M .::::going
`` What has <<target>> done ? ''::::she
`` Plunged a dagger into him , '' said Mr. O'Mahony , -- in a manner <<target>> showed to Frank that he was not much afraid of the consequences of the accident .::::which
`` You go up and no doubt she <<target>> tell you all about it . ''::::will
Then Frank went up , and was <<target>> admitted into Rachel 's room .::::soon
`` Oh , <<target>> ! ''::::frank
she said , `` <<target>> are you ?::::how
What on earth has <<target>> you here ? ''::::brought
Then he at once began to ask questions about poor <<target>> , and Rachel of course to answer them .::::moss
`` Well , yes ; how <<target>> I to help it ?::::was
I told him from the time that I was a little girl , long before I knew <<target>> , that something of this kind would occur if he would not behave himself . ''::::you
`` And he <<target>> n't ? ''::::did
asked Frank , with <<target>> little pardonable curiosity .::::some
`` No , <<target>> did not .::::he
Whether he wanted me or my voice , thinking that it would come <<target>> again , I can not tell , but he did want something .::::back
There was a woman who brought messages from <<target>> , and even she wanted something .::::him
Then his ideas <<target>> higher . ''::::ran
`` He meant to marry <<target>> , '' said Frank .::::you
He took hold <<target>> me .::::of
I can not bear to be taken hold <<target>> ; you know that yourself . ''::::of
He could only remember how often he had sat with her down among the willows at the lake side <<target>> his arm round her waist , and she had never seemed to be impatient under the operation .::::with
`` And though he has such a <<target>> shiny hat he is horribly awkward .::::beautiful
He nearly knocked me down and fell on <<target>> , by way of embracing me . ''::::me
Frank thought that he had never been <<target>> to such straits as that .::::driven
`` To be knocked down and trampled <<target>> by a beast like that !::::on
In those days -- yesterday , that is , or <<target>> week ago -- I was a poor singing girl .::::a
There are so many white bears about , ready to <<target>> you , if you do not look after yourself .::::eat
You do not blame <<target>> , Frank . ''::::me
`` No , indeed ; <<target>> for that . ''::::not
`` What do you <<target>> me for ? ''::::blame
`` I can not think you right , '' he answered with almost <<target>> sternness , `` to have accepted the offer of Lord Castlewell . ''::::majestic
`` You blame me <<target>> that . ''::::for
He nodded his <<target>> at her .::::head
`` What would you have <<target>> me do ? ''::::had
How was I to marry a man when I loved <<target>> , -- I who had been so treated ?::::him
But , sir , '' she said , remembering herself , `` <<target>> have no right to say I did not love Lord Castlewell .::::you
You have no business to <<target>> into that matter .::::inquire
Nobody blames you , or can , or shall , <<target>> that affair , -- not in my hearing .::::in

Frank , I have not <<target>> quite so well .::::behaved
You may inquire <<target>> it .::::about
He came to me when my singing was <<target>> gone , and generously renewed his offer .::::all
Had I not known that in his heart of hearts he did not wish it , -- that the two things were gone for which he had wooed me , -- my voice , which <<target>> grand , and my prettiness , which was but a little thing , I should have taken his second offer , because it would be well to let him have what he wanted .::::was
It was not so ; and therefore I <<target>> him away , well pleased . ''::::sent
`` But why did <<target>> accept him ? ''::::you
do not be <<target>> hard .::::too
How am I to tell you -- you , <<target>> all men , what my reasons were ?::::of
I was alone in the world ; alone with such dangers <<target>> me as that which Mr. Moss brought with him .::::before
Do all the girls refuse the lords <<target>> come and ask them ? ''::::who
`` I recognise it now ; and <<target>> there be an end of it .::::let
There is a something which does make <<target>> woman unfit for matrimony . ''::::a
And the tears coursed themselves <<target>> her wan cheeks .::::down
`` Now it has all been said that need be <<target>> , and let there be an end of it .::::said
I have talked too <<target>> about myself .::::much
What has brought you <<target>> London ? ''::::to
A pang shot through her heart ; and yet not quite a pang , for with it there was a rush <<target>> joy , which was not , however , perfect joy , because she felt that it must be disappointed .::::of
How are you going <<target>> in Galway ? ''::::on
`` Sadly enough , to <<target>> the truth . ''::::tell
`` Nothing but murders <<target>> floods ? ''::::and
`` The same damnable old story running <<target>> from day to day . ''::::on
`` And have the girls <<target>> servants yet ? ''::::no
`` Not a servant ; except old Peter , who <<target>> not quite as faithful as he should be . ''::::is
`` And , -- and what about that <<target>> gay young gentleman , Captain Clayton ? ''::::valiant
`` Everything goes amiss in love as <<target>> as war , '' said Frank .::::well
`` Between the three of them , <<target>> hardly know what they want . ''::::i
Everything goes so astray with all of us , so that <<target>> wanting it is sufficient reason for not getting it . ''::::the
`` Is that all you have <<target>> to tell me ? ''::::come
`` I suppose <<target>> is . ''::::it
`` Then you might <<target>> stayed away . ''::::have
`` I may as well <<target>> , perhaps . ''::::go
I am not so full of new friends that I <<target>> afford to throw away my old like that .::::can
Do you suppose I do not care to hear about those girls <<target>> I love , -- pretty nearly with all my heart ?::::whom
Why do n't you tell me <<target>> them , and your father ?::::about
You come here , but you <<target>> of nothing but going .::::talk
You ai n't <<target>> nice . ''::::half
`` Can I come <<target>> yet ? ''::::in
`` Not quite <<target>> , father .::::yet
Mr. Jones is telling me about <<target>> all at Morony Castle . ''::::them
`` I should have thought I might have <<target>> that , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::heard
`` The girls have special messages <<target>> send , '' said Rachel .::::to
`` I 'll come back in another <<target>> minutes , '' said Mr. O'Mahony .::::ten
`` I shall not wait <<target>> than that . ''::::longer
`` Only their love , '' said Frank ; upon which Rachel <<target>> as though she thought that Frank Jones was certainly an ass .::::looked
`` Of course I want to hear <<target>> love , '' said Rachel .::::their
`` Dear Ada , <<target>> dear Edith !::::and
Why do n't you tell <<target>> their love ? ''::::me
`` My poor sick girl , '' he said , laying <<target>> hand upon her shoulder , and looking into her eyes .::::his
`` Never mind <<target>> sickness .::::my
I know I am as thin <<target>> as wan as an ogre .::::and
Nevertheless , I care <<target>> their love . ''::::for
`` Rachel , do you <<target>> for mine ? ''::::care
You have spoken a word , just a word , and <<target>> the blood is coming back to my veins already . ''::::all
`` Now you have spoken ; now you have <<target>> me of your sisters and your father .::::told
Now I know <<target>> all !::::it
Now my father may <<target>> in . ''::::come
`` Do you love <<target>> , then ? ''::::me
That question you know <<target>> be unnecessary .::::to
Why I spend every day and <<target>> night in loving you !::::every
But , Frank , you would n't have <<target>> when I was going to be rich .::::me
I ought not to have you now <<target>> I am to be poor . ''::::that
`` Oh , Frank , <<target>> a tyrant you are !::::what
Did I not tell you to let <<target>> father come into the room ?::::poor
You have said <<target>> now .::::everything
There can not be <<target>> word to say .::::another
I have found it <<target>> at last .::::out
I can not live <<target>> you . ''::::without
`` But how are you <<target>> live with me ?::::to
There is no <<target>> . ''::::money
Washing stockings over a tub is the only life for me , -- <<target>> long as I have you to come back to me . ''::::so
`` And your <<target>> ? ''::::health
`` I tell you <<target>> is done .::::it
I was merely sick <<target>> the Jones complaint .::::of
how I can hate people , and <<target>> I can love them ! ''::::how
Then she threw herself on the sofa , absolutely <<target>> out by the violence of her emotions .::::worn
Mr. O'Mahony was commissioned , and sat down <<target>> his girl 's side to comfort her .::::by
But she wanted <<target>> comforting .::::no
`` So you and Frank have made <<target>> up , have you ? ''::::it
`` We have never quarrelled so far as <<target>> am concerned , '' said Frank .::::i
`` The moment I heard Lord Castlewell <<target>> dismissed , I came back . ''::::was
`` Yes , '' said she , <<target>> herself half up on the sofa .::::raising
`` Do you know <<target>> story , father ?::::his
It is rather a nice story for a girl to hear of <<target>> own lover , and to feel that it is true .::::her
When I was about to make I do n't know how many thousand dollars a <<target>> by my singing , he would not come and take his share of it .::::year
Then I have to think <<target>> my own disgrace .::::of
But it enhances <<target>> glory .::::his
Because he was gone , I brought <<target>> to accept this lord . ''::::myself
`` Now , Rachel , you shall <<target>> exert yourself , '' said Frank .::::not
`` I will , sir , '' she <<target>> , holding him by the hand .::::replied
`` I will <<target>> my story .::::tell
He had retreated from the stain , and <<target>> lord had come in his place .::::the
But he was here always , '' and <<target>> pressed his hand to her side .::::she
`` He could not <<target>> got rid of .::::be
Then I lost my voice , and was 'utterly <<target>> , ' as the theatrical people say .::::dished
Then the lord went , -- behaving better than <<target>> did however , -- and I was alone .::::i
Oh , what bitter moments there came then , -- long <<target>> for the post to go to Ireland and to return !::::enough
And now he <<target>> here .::::is
And then he talks <<target>> me of money !::::to
What is money <<target>> me ?::::to
I have got such a comforting portion that <<target>> care not at all for money . ''::::i
Then she all but fainted once again , and Frank <<target>> her father both knelt over her caressing her .::::and
It was a long time before Frank left her , her father going <<target>> and out of the room as it pleased him the while .::::in
Then he declared that he must go down to the House , assuring Frank that one blackguard there was worse <<target>> another , but saying that he would see them to the end as long as his time lasted .::::than
Rachel insisted that Frank <<target>> go with him .::::should
I can think about you <<target>> talking to you . ''::::without
And so saying <<target>> dismissed him .::::she
On the next morning , when he came again , she <<target>> with him the future arrangement of his life and hers .::::discussed
`` Of course you must stay with <<target>> father , '' she said .::::your
`` You do not want to marry <<target>> at once , I suppose .::::me
And of course it is <<target>> if you do .::::impossible
I shall go to the States with father <<target>> soon as this Parliament affair is over .::::as
He is turned out of the House so often that <<target>> will be off before long for good and all .::::he
But there is the mail still running , <<target>> remember that what I say is true .::::and
I shall be ready and willing to be made Mrs. Frank Jones as soon as you will come and fetch me , <<target>> will tell me that you are able to provide me just with a crust and a blanket in County Galway .::::and
Whatever little you will do with , <<target>> will do with less . ''::::i
Then she sat upon his knee , and embraced him and kissed him , and <<target>> to him that no other Lord Castlewell who came should interfere with his rights .::::swore
`` And as for Mr. Moss , '' she added , `` I do <<target>> think that he will ever appear again to trouble your little game . ''::::not
One morning , a little later in the summer , about the beginning <<target>> August , all Galway were terrified by the tidings of another murder .::::of
Mr. Morris had been killed , -- had been `` dropped , '' as the <<target>> of the country now went , from behind a wall built by the roadside .::::language
It had been done at about five in the afternoon , in full daylight ; and , <<target>> was surmised by the police , with the consciousness of many of the peasantry around .::::as
He had been walking along the road from Cong to his own house , <<target>> had been `` dropped , '' and left for dead by the roadside .::::and
Dead , indeed , <<target>> was when found .::::he
Not a word more would have been said about it , but for the intervention <<target>> the police , who were on the spot within three hours of the occurrence .::::of
A little girl had been coming into <<target>> , and had told the news .::::cong
The little girl was living at Cong , and was <<target>> to be in no way connected with the murder .::::supposed
`` It 's some of them boys this side of <<target>> , '' said one of the men of Cong .::::clonbur
No one thought it necessary after that to <<target>> any further explanation of the circumstances .::::give
Mr. Robert Morris was somewhat of an oddity in his way ; but he was a man <<target>> only a few months since was most unlikely to have fallen a victim to popular anger .::::who
He was about forty years of age , and had lived altogether at Minas Cottage , five or six <<target>> from Cong , as you pass up the head of Lough Corrib , on the road to Maum .::::miles
He kept a horse and a car and a couple of cows <<target>> a few cocks and hens ; but otherwise he lived alone .::::and
People said of him that he had Â£500 a year ; but he would have been very glad to have seen the half of <<target>> paid to his agent ; for Mr. Morris , of Minas Cottage , had his agent as well as any other gentleman .::::it
He was a magistrate for the two counties , Galway and <<target>> , and attended sessions both at Cong and at Clonbur .::::mayo
But when there he did little but agree with some more active magistrate ; <<target>> what else he did with himself no one could tell of him .::::and
But it was said in respect to him that he was a benevolent gentleman ; and but a year or <<target>> since very many in the neighbourhood would have declared him to be especially the poor man 's friend .::::two
With Â£500 a year he could have done much ; with half that income <<target>> could do something to assist them , and something he still did .::::he
He had his foibles , and fancies , but such as they were <<target>> did not tread on the corns of any of his poorer neighbours .::::they
He was proud of his birth , proud of his family , proud of having owned , either in his own hands or those of <<target>> forefathers , the same few acres , -- and many more also , for his forefathers before him had terribly diminished the property .::::his
There was a story that his great great grandfather <<target>> lived in a palatial residence in County Kilkenny .::::had
All this he would tell freely , and would remark that to such <<target>> extent had the family been reduced by the extravagance of his forefathers .::::an
`` But the name and the blood they <<target>> never touch , '' he would remark .::::can
They would not ask as to his successor , because they valued him too highly , and because Mr. Morris would never have <<target>> that the time had come when it was too late to bring a bride home to the western halls of his forefathers .::::admitted
But the rumour went that Minas Cottage would go in the female line to a second cousin , who had <<target>> a cloth merchant in Galway city , to whom nor to her husband did Mr. Morris ever speak .::::married
There might be something absurd in this , but there was nothing injurious to his <<target>> , and nothing that would be likely to displease the poorer of them .::::neighbours
But Mr. Morris had been made the <<target>> of various requests from his tenants .::::subject
They had long since wanted and had <<target>> a considerable abatement in their rent .::::received
Hence had come the straitened <<target>> of Â£250 a year .::::limits
To explain the `` Griffith 's valuation '' a chapter must be written , and <<target>> no one would read the explanation if given here it shall be withheld .::::as
Indeed , the whole circumstances of Mr. Morris 's property were <<target>> intricate to require , or to admit , elucidation here .::::too
He was so driven that if he were to keep anything for himself he must do so by means of the sheriff 's <<target>> , and hence it had come to pass that he had been shot down like a mad dog by the roadside .::::officer
County Galway was tolerably well used to murders by this time , but <<target>> seemed to be specially astonished by the assassination of Mr. Morris .::::yet
And then the taciturnity of the county <<target>> when the murder had been effected !::::side
It was not such a deed as was the slaughtering of poor Florian <<target>> , or the killing of Terry Carroll in the court house .::::jones
They had been more startling , more alarming , more awful for the tradesmen , and such like , to talk <<target>> among themselves , but the feeling of mystery there had been connected with the secret capacity of one individual .::::of
Everyone , in fact , knew that <<target>> murders had been done by Lax .::::those
And all felt that for the <<target>> of murders Lax was irrepressible .::::doing
But over there in the neighbourhood of Clonbur , or <<target>> the village of Cong , Lax had never appeared .::::in
There was no one in the place to <<target>> the police could attribute any Lax-like properties .::::whom
In that respect , the slaughtering of Mr. Morris had <<target>> in it more terrible even than those other murders .::::something
It seemed as though murder were becoming the ordinary popular mode by which the people should redress <<target>> , -- as though the idea of murder had recommended itself easily to their intellects .::::themselves
And then they had quietly submitted -- <<target>> of them -- to taciturnity .::::all
Such were the only replies that <<target>> given to the police .::::were
If Mr. Morris , then why not another -- and <<target>> -- till the whole country would be depopulated ?::::another
In Mr. Morris 's case a landlord had been chosen ; but in other localities agents and sheriffs ' officers , -- and even <<target>> keepers on a property which a gentleman is supposed to employ , -- were falling to the right and to the left .::::those
But of Mr. Morris and <<target>> death nothing was heard .::::his
Yorke Clayton of course went down there , for this , too , was in his <<target>> , and Hunter went with him , anxious , if possible , to learn something .::::district
There was not one as to whom they could <<target>> evidence that he was ever ferocious by character .::::obtain
`` They 've got to think that <<target>> have the right to it all .::::they
The poor creatures are not so bad <<target>> them that is teaching them .::::as
If I think as the farm is my own , of course I <<target>> n't like to be made to pay rent for it . ''::::do
That was the explanation of the circumstances , as given <<target>> Mrs. Davies , of the hotel at Clonbur .::::by
And it was evident that she <<target>> it to be sufficient .::::thought
This Mr. Morris had been the first cousin <<target>> our poor old friend Black Tom Daly .::::of
he exclaimed , as soon as he read the news , sitting in his <<target>> at Daly 's Bridge ; `` there is Bob Morris gone now . ''::::parlour
`` Bob Morris , <<target>> Minas Cottage ! ''::::of
exclaimed Peter Bodkin , who had ridden over to give Tom Daly <<target>> comfort in his solitude , if it might be possible .::::some
Did you know <<target>> ? ''::::him
`` I do n't think he <<target>> came out hunting . ''::::ever
How should he , when he had n't <<target>> horse that he could ride upon ?::::a
And Bob knew <<target>> of sport .::::nothing
The better for him , seeing the <<target>> that things are going now .::::way
No , he never was <<target>> hunting , poor fellow .::::out
But for downright innocence and kindness and gentleness of <<target>> , there is no one left like him .::::heart
And now they <<target>> murdered him !::::have
What is to be <<target>> end of it ?::::the
`` And Raheney Gorse fired so as to <<target>> every fox out of the country !::::drive
Persse is wrong , and I am <<target>> to stay at his bidding .::::wrong
The very nature of mankind has <<target>> in the old country .::::altered

There is a damnable cruelty in it of which men <<target>> not guilty , -- by G -- -- !::::were
they were not capable , -- <<target>> year or two ago .::::a
These ruffians from America have come and told them that they shall pay no rent , <<target>> their minds have been so filled with the picture that its magnificence has overcome them .::::and
They used to tell us that money is the root <<target>> all evil ; it proves to be true now .::::of
The gentlemen are their enemies , <<target>> therefore they will spite them .::::and
After a while Tom <<target>> his ejaculations .::::continued
There are those who think that man to be great and good ; but how <<target>> he be great and good if he lets loose such spirits among us ?::::can
They tell me that he 's a very amiable man in his own family , and goes to church regular ; <<target>> he must be the most ignorant human being that ever took upon himself to make laws for a people .::::but
He can understand nothing about money , <<target>> about property , nothing about rents !::::nothing
I suppose he thinks it fair to take away one man 's means and give <<target>> to another , simply because one is a gentleman and the other not !::::them
There 's nothing I hate so much in my <<target>> soul as the idea of a fair rent .::::very
A fair rent means half that a man pays now ; but in a few <<target>> ' time it will mean again whatever the new landlord may choose to ask .::::years
Every man is to get what does n't belong to him , and if a <<target>> has anything he 's to be turned out ; that is fixity of tenure .::::man
A man is to be allowed to <<target>> what is n't his own .::::sell
He thinks that when he has thrown half an eye over a <<target>> he can improve it by altering all the wisdom of ages .::::country
A man talks and talks , and others listen to him till they <<target>> him that another God Almighty has been sent upon earth . ''::::flatter
It was thus that Tom Daly expressed himself as to the Prime Minister of the day ; but Tom was a benighted Tory , <<target>> had thought nothing of these subjects till they were driven into his mind by the strange mortality of the foxes around him .::::and
Poor Mr. Morris was buried , and <<target>> was an end of him .::::there
The cloth merchant 's wife in Galway got the property ; and , as far as we can hear at <<target>> , is not likely to do as well with it as her husband is with his bales of goods .::::present
He did nothing , and his figure , as he walked <<target>> between Cong and Clonbur , could be well spared .::::about
But his murder had given rise to feelings through the <<target>> which were full of mischief and full of awe .::::country
He had lived most inoffensively , and yet he had gone simply because it had occurred to some poor ignorant tenant , who had held perhaps ten or fifteen acres of land , out <<target>> which he had lived upon the potatoes grown from two or three of them , that things would go better with him if he had not a landlord to hurry him for rent !::::of
Then the tenant had turned in his mind the best means of putting his landlord out <<target>> the way , and had told himself that it was an easy thing to do .::::of
He had not , of his own , much capacity for the use of firearms ; but he had four pound ten , which should have gone to <<target>> payment of his rent , and of this four pound ten , fifteen shillings secured the services of some handy man out of the next parish .::::the
He had heard the question of murder freely discussed among his neighbours , and by <<target>> to others had learned the general opinion that there was no danger in it .::::listening
So far the question was solved between this tenant and this landlord ; but each one of <<target>> neighbours , as he thought of it , felt himself bound to secrecy _pro bono publico_ .::::the
There was a certain comfort in this , and poor Bob Morris 's <<target>> seemed likely to be passed over with an easy freedom from suspicion .::::death
But men among themselves began to talk somewhat too freely , and an awe <<target>> among them as this man and that man were named as objectionable .::::grew
And the men so named were <<target>> all landlords or even agents .::::not
This man was a sheriff 's <<target>> , and that a gamekeeper .::::officer
The sheriffs ' officers and gamekeepers were not all murdered , but they were named , <<target>> a feeling of terror crept cold round the hearts of those who heard the names .::::and
Who was to be the keeper of the <<target>> and decide finally as to the victims ?::::list
Then suddenly a man went , and <<target>> one knew why he went .::::no
He was making a fence between two fields , and it was <<target>> that he had been cautioned not to make the fence .::::whispered
At any rate he had been stoned to death , and though there must have <<target>> three at least at the work , no one knew who had stoned him .::::been
Men began to whisper among each other , and women also , and at <<target>> it was whispered to them that they had better not whisper at all .::::last
And with such of the gentry as were left there had grown up precautions which <<target>> not but fill the minds of the peasantry with a vague sense of fear .::::could
Those who but a few months since had been the natural friends <<target>> the people , now appeared everywhere in arms against them .::::of
A further attempt at murder had been made in the neighbourhood , and was <<target>> talked of that it seemed that all kindly feeling had been severed .::::so
Men began to creep about and keep out of the way lest they should be suspected ; and , indeed , it <<target>> the fact that there was hardly an able-bodied man in three parishes to whom some suspicion did not attach itself .::::was
And thus the women would ask for fresh murders , and would feel disappointed when <<target>> were reported to them , craving , as it were , for blood .::::none
And all this had come to pass <<target>> within the space of two years !::::certainly
A sweeter-tempered people than had existed there had been found nowhere ; nor <<target>> people more ignorant , and possessing less of the comforts of civilisation .::::a
But no evil was to be expected from them , no harm came from them -- <<target>> a few simple lies , which were only harmful as acting upon their own character .::::beyond
As Tom Daly had said , these very men <<target>> not capable of it a few months ago .::::were
The tuition had <<target>> from America !::::come
That , no doubt , was true ; but it had come by <<target>> hearts and Irish voices , by Irish longings and Irish ambition .::::irish
But there does grow up in New York , or thereabouts , a mixture of Irish poverty with American wealth , which calls itself `` <<target>> , '' and forms as bad a composition as any that I know from which either to replenish or to create a people .::::democrat
A very little of it <<target>> unfortunately a long way .::::goes
It is like gin made of <<target>> when mingled with water .::::vitriol
A small modicum of gin , though it does not add much <<target>> to the water , will damnably defile a large quantity .::::spirit
And this gin has in it a something of <<target>> which will altogether deceive an uneducated palate .::::flavour
There is an alcoholic afflatus which mounts to the brain and surrounds the heart and <<target>> the veins , which for the moment is believed to be true gin .::::permeates
But it makes itself known in the morning , and <<target>> a few mornings tells its own tale too well .::::after
These `` democrats '' could <<target>> do us the mischief .::::never
They are not sufficient , either in intellect or in number ; but there are men among us who <<target>> taught themselves to believe that the infuriated gin drinker is the true holder of a new gospel .::::have
In those days Captain Clayton spent much of his time <<target>> Cong , and Frank Jones was often with him .::::at
Frank , however , had returned <<target>> London a much altered man .::::from
Rachel had knocked <<target>> to him .::::under
It was thus that he <<target>> of it to himself .::::spoke
I do not think that she spoke of <<target>> to herself exactly in the same way .::::it
She knew her own constancy , and <<target>> that she was to be rewarded .::::felt
`` Nothing , I think , would ever <<target>> made me marry Lord Castlewell . ''::::have
It was thus she talked to her father while <<target>> was awaiting the period of his dismissal .::::he
`` Of course he is <<target>> poor weak creature .::::a
But he would have been very good to you , and <<target>> would have been an end to all your discomforts . ''::::there
Rachel turned up <<target>> nose .::::her
An end to <<target>> her discomforts !::::all
Her father knew nothing of what would <<target>> her and what would discomfort .::::comfort
She was utterly discomforted in that <<target>> voice was gone from her .::::her
She would lie and sob on her bed half the <<target>> , and would feel herself to be inconsolable .::::morning
Then she would think of Frank , and tell herself <<target>> there was some consolation in store even for her .::::that
Had her voice been left to her she would have found <<target>> to be very difficult to escape from the Castlewell difficulty .::::it
She would have escaped , she thought , though the <<target>> might have been brought down over her head .::::heavens
When the time had come for appearing at the altar , she would have got into <<target>> first train and disappeared , or have gone to bed and refused to leave it .::::the
She would have summoned Frank at the last moment , and would submit to be <<target>> the worst behaved young woman that had ever appeared on the London boards .::::called
`` I might have been the greatest woman of the day , and <<target>> I must be content to make his tea and toast . ''::::now
Then she began to consider whether it was good that <<target>> girl should be the greatest woman of the day .::::any
`` I do n't suppose the Queen has so much the best <<target>> it with a pack of troubles on her hands . ''::::of
But Frank in the meantime had gone back to <<target>> , and Mr. Robert Morris had been murdered .::::galway
Soon after the death of Mr. Morris the man had been killed as he was mending the ditch , and <<target>> Clayton found that the tone of the people was varied in the answers which they made to his inquiries .::::captain
They were astounded , and , as <<target>> were , struck dumb with surprise .::::it
Nobody knew anything , nobody had heard <<target>> , nobody had seen anything .::::anything
They were as much in the dark about poor Pat <<target>> as they had been as to Mr. Robert Morris .::::gilligan
They spoke of Pat as though he had been slaughtered by a direct <<target>> from heaven ; but they trembled , and were evidently uncomfortable .::::blow
`` That woman knows something about it , '' <<target>> Hunter to his master , shaking his head .::::said
`` No doubt she knows a good deal about it ; but it is <<target>> because she knows that she is bewildered and bedevilled in her intellect .::::not
She is beginning to be afraid that the country is one <<target>> which even she herself can not live in safety . ''::::in
And the men looked to <<target>> dumbfoundered and sheepfaced .::::be
`` What 's the good of axing when <<target>> knows that I knows nothing ? ''::::ye
This was the answer of one man , and was a fair sample of the answers of many ; but they were <<target>> in such a tone that Clayton was beginning to think that the evil was about to work its own cure .::::given
`` Frank , '' he said one day when he was walking with his friend in the <<target>> of the evening , `` this state of things is too horrible to endure . ''::::gloom
The faithful Hunter followed them , and another policeman , for the Captain was <<target>> allowed to stir two steps without the accompaniment of a brace of guards .::::never
`` Much too horrible to be <<target>> , '' said Frank .::::endured
`` My idea is that a man , in order to <<target>> the best of himself , should run away from it .::::make
Life in the United States has <<target>> such horrors as these .::::no

`` You see <<target>> money . ''::::american
`` American money in the shape of dollar bills ; <<target>> they have all been sent by Irish people .::::but
The United States is a large place , and there is <<target>> there , I think , for an honest man . ''::::room
`` I 'll never be frightened out of <<target>> own country , '' said Clayton .::::my
`` Nor do I <<target>> there is occasion .::::think
These abominable reprobates are not going <<target>> prevail in the end . ''::::to
`` They have prevailed <<target>> poor Tom Daly .::::with
He was a man who worked as hard as <<target>> to find amusement , -- and employment too .::::anyone
He was even so honest as to <<target>> a fair price for his horses .::::charge
And there he is , left high and dry , without a horse <<target>> a hound that he can venture to keep about his own place .::::or
And simply because the majority of the people have chosen that there shall be no more <<target>> ; and they have proved themselves to be able to have their own way .::::hunting
It is impossible that poor Daly should hunt if they will not permit him , and they carry their orders so <<target>> that he can not even keep a hound in his kennels because they do not choose to allow it . ''::::far

`` All that <<target>> true . ''::::is
`` Will it not be better to go to America , to go to Africa , to go to Asia , or to Russia even , <<target>> to live in a country like this , where the law can afford you no protection , and where the lawgivers only injure you ? ''::::than
`` I know nothing about the lawgivers , '' said Clayton , `` <<target>> I have to say a word or two about the law .::::but
Do you think this kind of <<target>> is going to remain ? ''::::thing
`` It does remain , and <<target>> day becomes worse . ''::::every
`` An evil will always become worse <<target>> it begins to die away .::::till

Yorke Clayton , as he said this , was <<target>> to his love affair with Edith Jones .::::alluding
He had now conquered all <<target>> family with one exception .::::the
Even the father had assented that it should be <<target>> , though tardily and with sundry misgivings .::::so
The one person was Edith herself , and it had come to <<target>> acknowledged by all around her that she loved Yorke Clayton .::::be
As she herself never now denied it , it was admitted on all <<target>> at Morony Castle that the Captain was certainly the favoured lover .::::sides
But Edith still held out , and had gone so far as to tell the Captain <<target>> he could not be allowed to come to the Castle unless he would desist .::::that
`` As to that you <<target>> take my word . ''::::may
Then Edith had of course loved <<target>> so much the more .::::him
`` I do n't think this kind of thing will go <<target>> , '' he continued , still addressing Frank Jones .::::on
`` The people are so fickle that they <<target>> not be constant even to anything evil .::::can
It is quite on the cards that Black Tom Daly should next year be <<target>> most popular master of hounds in all Ireland , and that Mr .::::the

`` They 'd have burned the gorse before they <<target>> come round to that state of feeling .::::have
`` It is n't so easy to destroy <<target>> , '' said the philosophic Clayton .::::anything
`` If the foxes are frightened out of Raheeny <<target>> Moytubber , they will go somewhere else .::::or
And even if poor Tom Daly were to run away from County Galway , <<target>> you 're talking of doing , the county would find another master . ''::::as
`` There are as good fish in <<target>> sea as ever were caught .::::the
Tom Daly is a first-class man , I admit ; and he had no more obedient slave <<target>> myself when I used to get out hunting two or three days in the session .::::than
But he is a desponding man , and <<target>> not look forward to better times .::::can
For myself , I own <<target>> my hopes are fixed .::::that

Of course , I 'm an Irishman myself , and might have been a Lax <<target>> of a policeman , if chance had got hold of me in time .::::instead
As it is , I 've a sort of feeling that the policeman <<target>> going to have the best of it all through Ireland . ''::::is
Then there came a sudden sound as of a sharp thud , and <<target>> Clayton fell as it were dead at Frank Jones 's feet .::::yorke
This occurred at a corner of the road , from which a little boreen or <<target>> ran up the side of the mountain between walls about three feet high .::::lane
But here some benevolent enterprising gentleman , wishing to bring water through Lower Lough Cong to Lough Corrib , had caused the beginnings of <<target>> canal to be built , which had , however , after the expenditure of large sums of money , come to nothing .::::a
But the ground , or rather rock , had so been moved and excavated as to make it practicable <<target>> some men engaged , as had been this man , to drop at once out of sight .::::for
Hunter was at once upon his track , with the <<target>> policeman , both of whom fired at him .::::other
But as they acknowledged afterwards , they had barely seen the <<target>> of his coat in the gloom of the evening .::::skirt
The whole spot up and behind the corner of the road was so honeycombed by the <<target>> of the intended canal as to afford hiding-places and retreats for a score of murderers .::::works
Here , as was afterwards ascertained , there was <<target>> one , and that one had apparently sufficed .::::but
Frank Jones had remained on the road with his friend , <<target>> had raised him in his arms when he fell .::::and
`` They have done for me this time , '' <<target>> had said , but had said no more .::::clayton
He had in truth fainted , but Frank Jones , <<target>> his ignorance , had thought that he was dead .::::in
It turned out afterwards that the bullet had struck his ribs in the front of his body , and , having <<target>> turned by the bone , had passed round to his back , and had there buried itself in the flesh .::::been
It needs not that we dwell with any length on this part of our tale , but may <<target>> at once that the medical skill of Cong sufficed to extract the bullet on the next morning .::::say
Hunter , though still maimed by his wound , stuck to the pursuit , <<target>> by two other policemen from Cong , who soon appeared upon the scene .::::assisted
But the man escaped , and his flight <<target>> soon covered by the darkness of night .::::was
At least , so it was said after the occurrence ; though , had nothing <<target>> , they would have reached their homes before night had in truth set in .::::happened
But men said of Clayton that he had become so hardened by the practices of his life , and <<target>> the failure of all attempts hitherto made against him , that he had become incredulous of harm .::::by
`` Thank God it was <<target>> you instead of me .::::not
I have been thinking of it as I lay here <<target>> the night , and have blamed myself greatly .::::in
It is my business <<target>> not yours . ''::::and
And then again further on in the <<target>> he sent a message to Edith .::::day
`` Tell her from me that it is all over now , but <<target>> had I lived she would have had to be my wife . ''::::that
But from that time forth he did in truth get better , though we in <<target>> pages can never again be allowed to see him as an active working man .::::these
It was his fault , -- as the Galway doctor said his egregious sin , -- to spend the most of his <<target>> in lying on a couch out in the garden at Morony Castle , and talking of the fate of Mr. Lax .::::time
`` If I could catch that fellow , '' he said to Ada , alluding to the <<target>> who had intended to murder him , `` I would have no harm done to him .::::man
He should be let free at once ; for I could not <<target>> have got such an opportunity by any other means . ''::::possibly
But poor Edith , the while , <<target>> herself to be badly used .::::felt
She and Ada had often talked of the terrible perils to which Yorke Clayton was subjected , and , as the <<target>> may remember , had discussed the propriety of a man so situated allowing himself to become familiar with any girl .::::reader
But now Captain Clayton was declared <<target>> be safe by everybody .::::to
The doctors united in saying that his <<target>> would carry him through a cannon-ball .::::constitution
But Edith felt that all the <<target>> had fallen to her lot .::::danger
In the meantime the search for the double murderers , -- unless indeed <<target>> murderer had been busy in both cases -- was carried vainly along .::::one
The horror of poor Mr. Morris 's fate had almost disappeared <<target>> the awe occasioned by the attack on Captain Clayton .::::under
It was astonishing to see how entirely Mr. Morris , with all his family and his old acres , and with Minas Cottage , -- which , to the knowledge of the <<target>> population of Cong , was his own peculiar property , -- was lost to notice under the attack that had been made with so much audacity on Captain Yorke Clayton .::::entire
He , as one of four , all armed to the <<target>> , was attacked by one individual , and attacked successfully .::::teeth
There were those who said at first that the bars of Galway jail must have <<target>> broken , and that Lax the omnipotent , Lax the omnipresent , had escaped .::::been
And it certainly was the case that many were <<target>> ignorance as to who the murderer had been .::::in
Probably all were ignorant , -- all of those who were in <<target>> well acquainted with the person of Mr. Morris ' murderer .::::truth
And in the minds of the people <<target>> the awe became greater than ever .::::generally
To them it was evident that anybody could murder anybody ; and evident also that it was permitted to them to do so by <<target>> new law which had sprung up of late in the country , almost enjoining them to exercise this peculiar mode of retaliation .::::this
The bravest thought that they were about to have their revenge against their <<target>> masters , and determined that the revenge should be a bloody one .::::old
No man among them could be much poorer than Pat Gilligan , and he had been <<target>> as one to be murdered , for some reason known only to the murderer .::::chosen
A new and terrible aristocracy was growing up among <<target>> , -- the aristocracy of hidden firearms .::::them
There was but little said among them , even by the husband to the wife , or by the <<target>> to the son ; because the husband feared his wife , and the father his own child .::::father
There had been a feeling of old among them that <<target>> were being ground down by the old aristocracy .::::they
There must ever be such an idea on the part of those who do not <<target>> enough to eat in regard to their betters , who have more than plenty .::::have
It can not be but that <<target>> should engender such feeling .::::want
But now the dread of the new aristocracy <<target>> becoming worse than that of the old .::::was
In the dull , dim minds of these poor people there arose , gradually indeed but quickly , a conviction that the new aristocracy might be worse even than <<target>> old ; and that law , as administered by Government , might be less tyrannical than the law of those who had no law to govern them .::::the
So the people sat silent at their hearths , or crawled miserably about <<target>> potato patches , speaking not at all of the life around them .::::their
When a week was over , tidings came to them that Captain Clayton , though he had been shot right through the body , -- though the bullet <<target>> gone in at his breast and come out at his back , as the report went , -- was still alive , and likely to live .::::had
`` He 's a-spending every hour of his blessed life a-making <<target>> to a young lady who is a-nursing him . ''::::love
This was the report brought up to Cong by the steward of the lake <<target>> , and was received as a new miracle by the Cong people .::::steamer
The fates had decreed that Captain Clayton should not fall by any bullet fired by Lax , the Landleaguer ; for , though Lax , the Landleaguer , was himself fast in prison when the attempt was made , such <<target>> more than ever the creed of the people when it was understood that Captain Clayton , with his own flesh and blood , was at this moment making love to Mr. Jones 's youngest daughter at Morony Castle .::::became
Captain Clayton was thoroughly enjoying life , now perhaps , for the <<target>> time since he had had a bullet driven through his body .::::first
And yet Ada was willing to do everything that was required ; <<target>> she declared always that what she did was of no avail .::::but
`` Unless you take it to him , you know he <<target>> n't eat it , '' she would still say .::::wo
No doubt this was absurd , because the sick man 's appetite was very good , considering <<target>> a hole had been made from his front to his back within the last month .::::that
It was still September , the weather was as warm as summer , and he insisted on lying <<target>> in the garden with his rugs around him , and enjoying the service of all his slaves .::::out
But among his slaves Edith was the one whom <<target>> other slaves found it most difficult to understand .::::the
But , when he is well enough to be moved , <<target>> he or I must go out of this . ''::::either
`` Edith , '' said the Captain , one day , speaking from his rugs on the <<target>> upon the lawn , `` just say that one word , ' I yield . '::::bank
It will have to be <<target>> sooner or later . ''::::said
`` So you have gone back to <<target>> Captain , '' said he .::::the
You might as well let go my hand ; you know that I <<target>> not take it away violently , because of your wound . ''::::do
`` I know -- I know -- I know that a girl 's hand is the sweetest <<target>> in all creation if she likes you , and leaves it with you willingly . ''::::thing
Then there was a little pull , <<target>> it was only very little .::::but
`` Of course , I do n't want <<target>> hurt you , '' said Edith .::::to
`` And , therefore , it <<target>> as though you loved me .::::feels
Your hand says one thing <<target>> your voice another .::::and
Which way does your <<target>> go ? ''::::heart
But she could not help blushing at <<target>> lie as she told it .::::the
`` My conscience is altogether against you , and I advise <<target>> to attend more to that than to anything else . ''::::you
But still he held her hand , <<target>> still she let him hold it .::::and
At that moment Hunter appeared upon the <<target>> , and Edith regained her hand .::::scene
Hunter was full of his own news ; and , <<target>> he told it , very dreadful the story was .::::as
`` Oh , miss , no other murder ever told <<target>> had any horror in it equal to this !::::of
`` When a doubt creeps in , one can <<target>> disbelieve as much as one pleases . ''::::always
`` You can hardly disbelieve this , sir , as <<target>> have just heard the story from Sergeant Malcolm .::::i
There were six in the house , <<target>> five have been carried out dead .::::and
One has been taken to Cong , <<target>> he is as good as dead .::::and
The old woman was very old , and the <<target>> appears to have been her son . ''::::man
`` Have they <<target>> nobody ? ''::::got
`` It appears <<target>> , sir .::::not
But there is a rumour about the place that <<target>> were many of them in it . ''::::there
`` Looking after one another , '' said Clayton , `` <<target>> that none should escape his share of the guilt . ''::::so
`` It may <<target>> so .::::be
But there were many <<target>> it , sir .::::in
I ca n't tell much of the circumstances , except the <<target>> that there are the five bodies lying dead . ''::::fact
And Hunter , with some touch of dramatic effect and true pathos , pointed again to <<target>> mountains which he had indicated as the spot where this last murder was committed .::::the
It was soon settled among them that Hunter should go off to the scene of action , Cong , or wherever else his services <<target>> be required , and that he should take special care to keep his master acquainted with all details as they came to light .::::might
For us , we may give here the details as they did reach <<target>> Captain 's ears in the course of the next few days .::::the
Hunter 's story had <<target>> been too true .::::only
The six persons had been murdered , barring one child , who had been taken <<target>> Cong in a state which was supposed hardly to admit of his prolonged life .::::into
The others , who now lay dead at a shebeen house in the neighbourhood , consisted of an <<target>> woman and her son , and his wife and a grown daughter , and a son .::::old
All these had been killed in various ways , -- had been shot with rifles , and stoned with rocks , and made away with , after <<target>> fashion that might come most readily to the hands of brutes devoid of light , of mercy , of conscience , and apparently of fear .::::any
It must have been a terrible sight to see , for <<target>> who had first broken in upon the scene of desolation .::::those
In the course of the next morning it had become known to the police , and it was <<target>> rumoured throughout England and Ireland that there had been ten murderers engaged in the bloody fray .::::soon
A man who had been one of their number was less <<target>> to tell if he had a hand in it himself .::::likely
And so there were <<target>> of them .::::ten
And that one was not sure not to tell , -- had perhaps shown by some sign and <<target>> that to tell the truth about the deed was in his breast , -- or in hers !::::indication
Some woman living there might have spoken such a word to a <<target>> less cautious in that than were the neighbours in general .::::friend
Then we can hear , or fancy that we can hear , the <<target>> reasons of those who sought to rule amidst that bloody community .::::muttered
They were a family of the Kellys , -- these poor doomed creatures , -- but amidst those who whispered together , amidst those who were <<target>> to come into the whispering , there were many of the same family ; or , at any rate , of the same name .::::forced
For the Kellys were a tribe who had <<target>> strong in the land for many years .::::been
Though each of the ten feared to be of the bloody party , each did not like <<target>> to be of it , for so the power would have come out of their hands .::::not
They wished to be among the leading <<target>> , though still they feared .::::aristocrats
But a miracle had occurred , -- that which must have seemed to be a miracle when they first <<target>> it , and to the wretches themselves , when its fatal truth was made known to them .::::heard
While in the dead of night they were carrying out this most inhuman massacre there were other eyes watching them ; <<target>> other eyes were looking at them , and seeing what they did perhaps more plainly than they would see themselves !::::six
There were six persons doomed , and ten who had agreed to doom them ; and three others looking on from behind <<target>> wall , so near as to enable them to see it all , under the fitful light of the stars !::::a
It may be that it shall be proved that some <<target>> the ten had not struck a fatal blow .::::among
Or it may fail to be proved that <<target>> among the ten have done so .::::some
It will go hard with any man to adjudge ten men to death for one deed of murder ; and it is very hard for that one <<target>> remember always that the doom he is to give is the only means in our power to stop the downward path of crime among us .::::to
It may be that some among the ten shall be spared , and it <<target>> be that he or they who spare them shall have done right .::::may
But such was not the feeling of Captain Yorke Clayton as he discussed the matter , day <<target>> day , with Hunter , or with Frank Jones , upon the lawn at Castle Morony .::::after
`` The saddest sight the world <<target>> show , '' said Frank .::::could
`` Sad enough , that <<target>> world should want it .::::the
But if you had been employed as I have for the last few <<target>> , you would not think it sad to have achieved it .::::years
If the judge and the jury will do their work as it should be done <<target>> will be an end to this kind of thing for many years to come .::::there
Think of the country we <<target>> living in now !::::are
Think of your father 's condition , and of the injury which has <<target>> done to him and to your sisters , and to yourself .::::been
If that could be prevented and atoned for , and set right by the hanging in one <<target>> of ten such miscreants as those , would it not be a noble deed done ?::::row
These ten are frightful to you because there are ten at once , -- <<target>> in the same village , -- ten nearly of the same name !::::ten
People would call it a bloody <<target>> where so many are doomed .::::assize
But they scruple to call the country bloody <<target>> so many are murdered day after day .::::where
It is the honest who are murdered ; but would it <<target>> be well to rid the world of these ruffians ?::::not
And , remember , that these ten would not have been ten , <<target>> some one or two had been dealt with for the first offence .::::if
And if the ten were now all spared , <<target>> life would be safe in such a Golgotha ?::::whose
I say that , to those who desire to have their country once more human , once more fit for <<target>> honest man to live in , these ten men hanging in a row will be a goodly sight . ''::::an
There must have been a feeling in the minds of these three men that some terrible step must be taken <<target>> put an end to the power of this aristocracy , before life in the country would be again possible .::::to
Why should these ten have all <<target>> power in their own hands ?::::the
Why should these questions of life and death be remitted <<target>> them , to the exclusion of those other three ?::::to
And if this family of Kellys were doomed , why should there not <<target>> other families of other Kellys , -- why not their own families ?::::be
And if Kerrycullion were made to swim in blood , -- for that was the name of the townland in which these <<target>> lived , -- why not any other homestead round the place in which four or five victims may have hidden themselves ?::::kellys
So the three , with mutual whisperings among themselves , with many fears and with much trembling , <<target>> obtained some tidings of what was to be done , agreed to follow and to see .::::having
It was whispered about that one of the family , the poor man 's wife , probably , had seen the attack made upon poor Pat Gilligan , and <<target>> , or may not , have uttered some threat of vengeance ; may have shown some sign that the murder ought to be made known to someone .::::may
And he was not one of the other , the rich <<target>> , against whom all men 's hands were justly raised .::::aristocracy
Some such word had probably passed the unfortunate woman 's <<target>> , and the ten men had risen against her .::::lips
The ten men , each protecting each other , had sworn among themselves that so villainous a practice , so <<target>> an evil as this , of telling aught to the other aristocracy , must be brought to an end .::::glaring
But then the three interfered , and it was likely that the <<target>> , the rich aristocracy , should now know all about it .::::other
It was not to save the lives of <<target>> unfortunate women and children that they went .::::those
There would be <<target>> in that .::::danger
But they would creep along and see , and then they could tell ; or should <<target>> be disturbed in their employment , they could escape amidst the darkness of the night .::::they
There could be no escape for those poor wretches , stripped in their bed ; none for that aged woman , who could not take herself away from among the guns and <<target>> of her pursuers ; none for those poor children ; none , indeed , for the father of the family , upon whom the ten would come in his lair .::::rocks
If his wife had threatened to tell , <<target>> must pay for his wife 's garrulity .::::he
Pat Gilligan had suffered for some such offence , and it was <<target>> just that she and he and they should suffer also .::::but
And therefore they stalked forth at night and went up to Kerrycullion , <<target>> the heels of the other party , and saw it all .::::at
Now , one after another , the six were killed , or all but killed , and then <<target>> three went back to their homes , resolved that they would have recourse to the other aristocracy .::::the
Between Galway and Cong and Kerrycullion , Hunter was kept going in these <<target>> , so as to obtain always the latest information for his master .::::days
For , though the neighbourhood of Morony Castle was now supposed to be quiet , and though the <<target>> was not at the moment on active service , Hunter was still allowed to remain with him .::::captain
`` They are sticking to their <<target>> , all through ? ''::::story
he asked Hunter , or rather communicated <<target>> fact to Hunter for his benefit .::::the
sir ; they stick <<target>> their story .::::to
There is no doubt <<target>> them now .::::about
They ca n't <<target>> back . ''::::go
`` And that boy <<target>> talk now ? ''::::can
`` Yes , sir ; he <<target>> talk a little . ''::::can
`` And what he says <<target>> with the three men ?::::agrees
When they have once learned to think it possible that one man may <<target>> of another , there will be an end to that little game .::::tell
But they must hang <<target>> of course . ''::::them
sir , '' <<target>> Hunter .::::said
`` I 'd hang them myself ; the whole ten <<target>> them , rather than keep them waiting . ''::::of
`` The trial is <<target>> be in Dublin .::::to
Before that day comes we shall <<target>> what they do about Lax .::::find
I do n't suppose they will want me ; or if they did , for <<target>> matter of that , I could go myself as well as ever . ''::::the
`` You could do nothing of the kind , Captain <<target>> , '' said Edith , who was sitting there .::::clayton
`` It is absurd to hear you <<target>> in such a way . ''::::talk
`` I do n't suppose he could just go <<target>> to Dublin , miss , '' said Hunter .::::up
`` Not for life <<target>> death ? ''::::and
`` For his own death he <<target>> , '' said Edith .::::could
`` But it 's the death of other <<target>> that he is thinking of now . ''::::people
`` And you , what <<target>> you thinking of ? ''::::are
`` To tell the truth , just at <<target>> moment I was thinking of yours .::::this
You are here under our keeping , and as long as you remain so , we are bound to <<target>> what we can to keep you from killing yourself ; you ought to be in your bed . ''::::do
`` Tucked up all round , -- and <<target>> ought to be giving me gruel . ''::::you
Then Hunter simpered <<target>> went away .::::and
He generally did go away <<target>> the love-scenes began .::::when
`` You could give one something <<target>> would cure me instantly . ''::::which
`` No , <<target>> could not !::::i
There are no such instant cures known in the medical world for <<target>> man who has had a hole right through him . ''::::a
`` That bullet will <<target>> be immortal . ''::::certainly
`` But you will not if you <<target>> of going up to Dublin . ''::::talk
`` Edith , a kiss <<target>> cure me . ''::::would
`` Captain Clayton , you are in circumstances which <<target>> prevent you from alluding to any such thing .::::should
I am here to nurse you , <<target>> I should not be insulted . ''::::and
`` And if it be an insult to tell you what <<target>> kiss would do for me , I withdraw the word .::::a
Then when Ada had come down , Edith went to her <<target>> , and kissed the pillow , instead of him .::::bedroom
Oh , if it might be granted to her to go to him , <<target>> frankly to confess , that she was all , all his own !::::and
And she felt , as days went on , she would have to <<target>> , though honour still told her that she should never do so .::::yield
From this moment the mystery of the new aristocracy <<target>> to fade away , and get itself abolished .::::began
Men and women began to feel that there might be something worse in store <<target>> them than the old course of policemen , juries , and judges .::::for
It had seemed , at first , as though these evil things could be brought <<target>> an end , and silenced altogether as far as their blessed country was concerned .::::to
A time was coming in which everyone was to do as he <<target>> , without any fear that another should tell of him .::::pleased
Though a man should be seen in the broad daylight cutting the tails off half a score of oxen it would be recognised in the neighbourhood as <<target>> more than a fair act of vengeance , and nothing should be told of the deed , let the policemen busy themselves as they might .::::no
And the beauty of the system consisted in the fact that the fear of telling <<target>> brought home to the minds of all men , women , and children .::::was
Though it was certain that a woman had seen a cow 's tail mangled , though it could be proved beyond all doubt <<target>> she was in the field when the deed was done , yet if she held her peace no punishment would await her .::::that
The policeman and the magistrate <<target>> do nothing to her .::::could
But Thady O'Leary , the man who had cut a <<target>> 's tail off , could certainly punish her .::::cow
If nothing else were done she could be boycotted , or , in <<target>> words , not allowed to buy or sell the necessaries of life .::::other
Or she could herself be murdered , <<target>> had happened to Pat Gilligan .::::as
The whole thing had seemed <<target>> run so smoothly !::::to
The murder of Pat Gilligan , though it had made one in the necessary sequence of events , one act in the course of the <<target>> which , as a whole , had appeared to be so perfect , seemed to them all to have about it something terrible .::::drama
No one knew what offence Pat Gilligan had <<target>> , or why he had been condemned .::::given
Each man began to tremble as he thought that he too might be a <<target>> Gilligan , and each woman that she might be a Mrs. Kelly .::::pat
It was better to go back to <<target>> police and the magistrates than this !::::the
I do not know that we need lean too heavily on the stupidity of <<target>> country 's side in not having perceived that this would be so .::::the
The country 's side is very slow in <<target>> the course which things will take .::::perceiving
These ten murderers had been brought together , each from fear of the others ; and they must have felt that though they were ten , -- a number so great when they <<target>> the employment on which they were engaged as to cause horror to the minds of all of them , -- the ten could not include all who should have been included .::::considered
Had the other three been taken in , if that <<target>> possible , how much better it would have been !::::were
But the desire for murder had not gone so far , -- its beauty had not been so <<target>> acknowledged as to make it even yet possible to comprise a whole parish in destroying one family .::::perfectly
Then the three had seen that the whole scheme , the mystery of the thing , the <<target>> plan upon which it was founded , must be broken down and thrown to the winds .::::very
And we can imagine that , when the idea first came upon the minds of those three , that the entire family of the Kellys was to be <<target>> to stop the tongue of one talkative old woman , a horror must have fallen upon them as they recognised the duty which was incumbent on them .::::sacrificed
The duty of saving those six <<target>> they did not recognise .::::unfortunates
They could not screw themselves up to the necessary pitch of courage <<target>> enable them to enter in among loaded pistols and black-visaged murderers .::::to
The two women and the children had to die , though the three men were so close to them ; so close as to have <<target>> certainly able to save them , or some of them , had they rushed into the cabin and created the confusion of another advent .::::been
But an awful horror must have crept round their minds <<target>> they thought of the self-imposed task they had undertaken .::::as
They waited until the murders had been completed , and <<target>> they went back home and told the police .::::then
From this moment the mystery by which murders in County Galway and <<target>> were for a short period protected was over in Ireland .::::elsewhere
Men have not seen , as yet , how much more lovely it is to tell frankly all that has been done , to give openly <<target>> evidence as a man may have to police magistrates and justices of the peace , than to keep anything wrapped within his own bosom .::::such
The charm of such outspoken truth does not reconcile itself at once to the untrained mind ; but <<target>> fact of the loveliness does gradually creep in , and the hideous ugliness of the other venture .::::the
On the minds of those men of Kerrycullion something of the <<target>> and something of the loveliness must have made itself apparent .::::ugliness
And when this had been done it was not probable that a <<target>> to the utter ugliness of the lie should be possible .::::return
Whether the ten be hanged , -- to the intense satisfaction of Hunter and his master , -- or some fewer number , such as may suffice the mitigated desire for <<target>> which at present is burning in the breasts of men , the thing will have been done , and the mystery with all its beauty will have passed away .::::revenge
At Castle Morony the beginning of the passing away <<target>> the mystery was hailed with great delight .::::of
It took place <<target>> this wise .::::in
A little girl who had been brought up there in the kitchen , and had reached the age of fifteen under the eyes of Ada and Edith , -- a slip of a girl , whose feet our two girls had begun to <<target>> with shoes and stockings , and who was old enough to be proud of the finery though she could not bear the confinement , -- had gone under the system of boycotting , when all the other servants had gone also .::::trammel
Peter , who was very stern in his discipline to the younger people , had caught hold of her before she went , and had brought her <<target>> Mr. Jones , recommending that at any rate her dress should be stripped from her back , and her shoes and stockings from her feet .::::to
`` If you war to wallop her , sir , into the bargain , it <<target>> be a good deed done , '' Peter had said to his master .::::would
`` Why should I wallop her <<target>> leaving my service ? ''::::for
`` She ai n't guv ' no <<target>> , '' said the indignant Peter .::::notice
`` And if I were to wallop you because you had taken it into your stupid head <<target>> leave me at a moment 's notice , should I be justified in doing so ? ''::::to
`` There is differences , '' <<target>> Peter , drawing himself up .::::said
Let her go her own <<target>> as she pleases .::::gait
How am I to take upon myself to <<target>> that she is not right to go ?::::say
And for the shoes and stockings , let them go with her , and <<target>> dress also , if I am supposed to have any property in it .::::the
Fancy a Landleaguer in Parliament asking an indignant question <<target>> to my detaining forcibly an unwilling female servant .::::as
Let them all go ; the sooner we <<target>> to serve ourselves the better for us .::::learn
I suppose you will go <<target>> before long . ''::::too
This had been unkind , and Peter had made <<target>> speech in which he had said so .::::a
But the little affair had taken place in the beginning of the <<target>> disarrangements , and Mr. Jones had been bitter in spirit .::::boycotting
Now the girls had shown how deftly they could do the work , and had begun <<target>> talk pleasantly how well they could manage to save the wages and the food .::::to
But this had been before he had a hole driven through <<target>> , and he was only awed by a frown .::::him
But now news was brought in that Feemy <<target>> crept in at the back door .::::had
`` Drat her imperence , '' said <<target>> , who brought in the news .::::peter
`` It 's like her ways to come when she <<target>> n't get a morsel of wholesome food elsewhere . ''::::ca
Then Ada and Edith had rushed off to lay hold of the delinquent , who had indeed <<target>> a feeling in the hearts of her mistresses of some love for her little foibles .::::left
Feemy , so you 've come back again , '' said <<target>> , `` and you 've grown so big ! ''::::ada
But Feemy cowered and <<target>> not a word .::::said
`` What have you been <<target>> all the time ? ''::::doing
`` Miss Ada and I have had to clean out all the pots and all the pans , and all <<target>> gridirons , though for the matter of that there has been very little to cook on them . ''::::the
Then Ada asked the girl whether she intended <<target>> come back to her old place .::::to
`` If I 'm let , '' <<target>> the girl , bursting into tears .::::said
`` Where are the <<target>> and stockings ? ''::::shoes
But the girl <<target>> wept .::::only
`` Of course you shall come <<target>> , shoes or no shoes .::::back
I suppose times have been too hard with you <<target>> home to think much of shoes or stockings .::::at
Since your poor cousin was shot in Galway court-house , '' -- for Feemy was a cousin of the <<target>> of Carrolls , -- '' I fear it has n't gone very well with you all . ''::::tribe
But to this Feemy had <<target>> answered by renewed sobs .::::only
And gradually the other servants had returned , falling <<target>> into their places almost without a word spoken .::::back
One boy , who had in former days looked after the cows , absolutely did <<target>> and drive them in to be milked one morning without saying a word .::::come
`` I 'm just <<target>> O'Brien . ''::::larry
`` And what business <<target>> you here ? ''::::have
`` How many months ago is it since last year you took <<target>> off without even a word said to man or woman ?::::yourself
Who wants you back again <<target>> , I wonder ? ''::::now
And the old cook came back again from Galway , though she came after the writing of <<target>> letter which must have taken her long to compose , and the saying of many words .::::a
`` Honoured Miss , '' the letter went , `` I 've <<target>> at Peter Corcoran 's doing work any time these twelve months .::::been
And glad I 've been to <<target>> a hole to creep into .::::find
May the deevil go along with <<target>> , and with his pollytiks .::::him
Was n't one side in pollitiks the same as another to an old woman <<target>> me , who only wants to 'arn her bit and her sup ?::::like
I do n't care the vally of <<target>> tobacco-pipe for none of them now .::::a
So if the squire would take me back again , may <<target>> bless him for iver and iver , say I . ''::::god
Then this letter was signed Judy Corcoran , -- for she too was of the family of the Corcorans , -- and became <<target>> matter for many arrangements , in the course of which she once more was put into office as cook at Castle Morony .::::the
Then Edith wrote the following letter to her friend Rachel , who still remained in London , partly <<target>> of her health and partly because her father had not yet quite settled his political affairs .::::because
But that shall be <<target>> in another chapter .::::explained
Here we are beginning to see daylight , after having been <<target>> in Cimmerian darkness for the best part of two years .::::buried
And it has been done for papa , who has , I think , liked his bed <<target>> his dinner all the better , because they have passed through his daughters ' hands .::::and
What am I to say to you about Frank , who will not <<target>> much of your perfections , though he is always thinking of them ?::::talk
What more can a girl want than to have a lord to fall in love <<target>> her , and to give her up just as her inclination may declare itself ?::::with
What I write for now , specially , is to add a word <<target>> what I presume Frank may have said in one of his letters .::::to
Papa says that neither you nor Mr. O'Mahony are to think of <<target>> this side of the water without coming down to Castle Morony .::::leaving
We have got a cook <<target>> , and a cow-boy .::::now
What more can <<target>> want ?::::you
And old Peter is here still , always talking about the <<target>> things which he has done for the Jones family .::::infinite
Joking apart , you must of course come and see <<target>> again once before you start for New York .::::us
Is Frank to <<target>> with you ?::::go
That is a question to which we can <<target>> no answer at all from Frank himself .::::get
In your last you asked <<target>> about my affairs .::::me
Dear girl , I <<target>> no affairs .::::have
I am in such a position that it is impossible <<target>> me to have what you would call affairs .::::for
Between you and Frank <<target>> is settled .::::everything
Between me and the man to whom you allude there is nothing <<target>> , -- except that there is no ground for settlement .::::settled
He must go one <<target>> and I another .::::way
I , however , have done it for <<target>> and I must bear the burden .::::myself
It is not to be supposed that Mr. Jones succumbed altogether <<target>> the difficulties which circumstances had placed in his way .::::to
His feelings had been much hurt both by those who had chosen to call themselves <<target>> enemies and by his friends , and under such usage he became somewhat sullen .::::his
Having suffered a grievous misfortune he had become violent with his children , and had been more <<target>> hurt by the death of the poor boy who had been murdered than he had confessed .::::severely
But he had still struggled on , saying but little to anybody till at last he had <<target>> Frank into his confidence , when Frank had returned from London with his marriage engagement dissolved .::::taken
And the re-engagement had not at all interfered with the renewed intimacy between <<target>> and his father , because the girl was absolved from her singing .::::frank
The father had feared that the son would go away from him , and <<target>> an idle life , enjoying the luxuries which her rich salary would purchase .::::lead
All that was now set to rights by <<target>> absolute destruction of poor Rachel 's voice .::::the
Poor Mr. Jones had indeed received comfort <<target>> other sources more material than this .::::from
His relatives had put their heads together , and had agreed to bear some part of the loss which had fallen upon the estate ; not the loss , <<target>> is , from the submerged meadows , which was indeed Mr. Jones 's own private concern , but from the injury done to him by the commissioners .::::that
Where there was a shred of a lease the sub-commissioners were powerless , and though attempts had been made to break the leases they <<target>> failed ; and men were beginning to say that the new law would be comparatively powerless because it would do so little .::::had
The advocates for the law pointed out that , taking the land of Ireland all through , not five <<target>> cent. , -- and again others not two per cent. , -- would be affected by it .::::per
Whether it had been worth while to disturb the sanctity of contracts for so small a result is another <<target>> ; but our Mr. Jones certainly did feel the comfort that came to him from the fact .::::question
Certain fragments of land had been reduced by the sub-commissioners after ponderous sittings , very beneficial <<target>> the lawyers , but which Mr. Jones had found to be grievously costly to him .::::to
He had thus agreed to other reductions without the lawyers , and felt those also to be very <<target>> , seeing that since he had purchased the property with a Parliamentary title he had raised nothing .::::grievous
There was no satisfaction to him when he was told that a Parliamentary title meant <<target>> , because a following Parliament could undo what a preceding Parliament had done .::::nothing
But as the arrangements went on he came to find that no large proportion of <<target>> estates would be affected , and that gradually the rents would be paid .::::the
They had not been paid as yet , but <<target>> he was told was the coming prospect .::::such
Pat Carroll had risen up as a great authority at <<target>> , and had refused to pay a shilling .::::ballintubber
He had also destroyed those eighty acres of meadow-land <<target>> had sat so near Mr. Jones 's heart .::::which
It had been found impossible to punish him , but the <<target>> was to be traced to that poor boy 's delinquency .::::impossibility
As the owner of the property turned it all over within <<target>> own bosom , he told himself that it was so .::::his
It was that that had grieved him most , <<target>> which still sat heavy on his heart .::::that
Lax , too , was in prison , and Yorke Clayton <<target>> by all his gods that he should be hanged .::::swore
It was likely that he would be hanged , <<target>> Yorke Clayton might find his comfort in that .::::and
And now had come up this terrible affair at Kerrycullion , from which it <<target>> probable that the whole mystery of the new aristocracy would be abandoned .::::was
Mr. Jones , as he thought of it all , whispered to himself that if he <<target>> still hold up his head , life might yet be possible at Castle Morony .::::would
`` It will only be for myself , -- only for myself and <<target>> , '' he said , still mourning greatly over his fate .::::ada
`` And Ada will <<target>> , too .::::go
The beauty of the flock will never be <<target>> to remain here with her father . ''::::left
But in truth his regrets <<target>> chiefly for Edith .::::were
If that bloodthirsty Captain would have made himself satisfied <<target>> Ada , he might still have been happy .::::with
In these days he would walk down frequently to the <<target>> and see the work which the men were doing .::::meadows
He had greatly enlarged them , having borrowed money for the purpose from the Government <<target>> Commissioners , and was once again allowing new hopes to spring in his heart .::::land
Though he was a man so silent , and appearing to be so apathetic , <<target>> was intent enough on his own purposes when they became clear before his eyes .::::he
From his first coming into this country his purport had been to do good , <<target>> far as the radius of his circle went , to all whom it included .::::as
The necessity of living was no doubt the same with <<target>> as with others , -- and of living well .::::him
He must do something for <<target>> and his children .::::himself
But together with this was the desire , nearly equally <<target>> , of being a benefactor to those around him .::::strong
He had declared to himself when he bought the property that with this object would <<target>> settle himself down upon it , and he had not departed from it .::::he
He had brought up his children with this purpose ; and they had learned to feel , <<target>> and all , that it was among the pleasures and the duties of their life .::::one
Then had come Pat Carroll , and <<target>> had been embittered for him .::::everything
All Ballintubber and all Morony had <<target>> to turn against him .::::seemed
When he found that Pat Carroll was disposed to be hostile to him , <<target>> made the man a liberal offer to take himself off to America .::::he
But Mr. Jones , in those days , had heard nothing of Lax , and <<target>> unaware that Lax was a dominant spirit under whom he was doomed to suffer .::::was
`` I did not know you so well then , '' said Captain Clayton to Mr. Jones , <<target>> some weeks hence , `` or I could have told you that Pat Carroll is nobody .::::now
Pat Carroll is considered nobody , because <<target>> has not been to New York .::::he
Mr. Lax has travelled , <<target>> Mr. Lax is somebody .::::and
Mr. Lax settled himself in County Mayo , and thus he allowed <<target>> influence to spread itself among us over here in County Galway .::::his
Mr. Lax is a great man , but I rather think that he will have <<target>> be hanged in Galway jail before a month has passed over his head . ''::::to
Mr. Jones usually took his son with him when he walked about among the meadows , and he <<target>> expressed his wishes to him as though Frank hereafter were to have the management of everything .::::again
But on one occasion , towards the latter <<target>> of the afternoon , he went alone .::::half
There were different wooden barriers , having sluice gates passing between them , over which he would walk , and at present <<target>> were sheep on the upper meadows , on which the luxuriant grass had begun to grow in the early summer .::::there
He was looking at his sheep now , and thinking to himself that he could find <<target>> market for them in spite of all that the boycotters could do to prevent him .::::a
But in one corner , where the meadows ceased , and Pat Carroll 's land began , <<target>> met an old man whom he had known well in former years , named Con Heffernan .::::he
It was absolutely the case that he , the landlord , did not at the present moment know who occupied <<target>> Carroll 's land , though he did know that he had received no rent for the last three years .::::pat
And he knew also that Con was supposed to have been one <<target>> those who had assisted at the destruction of the sluice gates .::::of

A group of excited men were gathered in <<target>> of the Stock Exchange at Johannesburg .::::front
It was evident that something <<target>> unusual had happened .::::altogether
All wore anxious and angry expressions , but a few shook hands with each other , as if the <<target>> that so much agitated them , although painful , was yet welcome ; and indeed this was so .::::news
For months a war-cloud had hung over the town , but <<target>> had been thought that it might pass over without bursting .::::it
None imagined that the blow would come so suddenly , and when it fell it had all the force of a complete <<target>> , although it had been so threatening for many weeks that a considerable portion of the population had already fled .::::surprise
It was true that great numbers of men , well armed , and with large numbers of cannon , had been moving south , but negotiations were still going on <<target>> might continue for some time yet ; and now by the folly and arrogance of one man the cloud had burst , and in thirty hours war would begin .::::and
Similar though smaller groups were gathered <<target>> and there in the streets .::::here
Parties of Boers from the country round rode up and down with an air of insolent triumph , some of them shouting `` <<target>> shall soon be rid of you ; in another month there will not be a rooinek left in South Africa . ''::::we
Those addressed paid no <<target>> to the words .::::heed
They had heard the same thing over and <<target>> again for the past two months .::::over
There was a tightening of the lips and a closing of the fingers as if <<target>> a sword or rifle , but no one replied to the insolent taunts .::::on
For years it had been the hope of the Uitlanders that this would come , <<target>> that there would be an end to a position that was well-nigh intolerable .::::and
Never before had a large body of intelligent men been kept in a state of abject subjection by an inferior race , a race almost without even the elements of civilization , ignorant <<target>> brutal beyond any existing white community , and superior only in the fact that they were organized and armed , whereas those they trampled upon were deficient in both these respects .::::and
Having no votes , these were powerless to better their condition <<target>> the means common to civilized communities throughout the world .::::by
They were ground down by an enormous taxation , towards which the Boers themselves contributed practically nothing , and the revenue drawn from them was spent in the purchase of munitions of war , artillery , and fortifications , so enormously beyond the needs of <<target>> country , that it was no secret that they were intended not only for the defence of the republic against invasion , but for a general rising of the Boer population and the establishment of Dutch supremacy throughout the whole of South Africa .::::the
The Boer government was corrupt from <<target>> highest to the lowest .::::the
The president and the members of his family piled up wealth to <<target>> enormous amount , and nothing could be done without wholesale bribery .::::an
The price of everything connected with the mining industry was doubled by the supply being <<target>> the hands of monopolists , who shared their gains with high state officials .::::in
Money was lavished like water on what was called secret service , in subsidizing newspapers to influence public opinion throughout Europe , and , as it was strongly suspected , in carrying on a propaganda among <<target>> Dutch in Cape Colony , and in securing the return of members and a ministry secretly pledged to further in every way the aims of the Presidents of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State .::::the
The British and other aliens were not only deprived of all rights of citizenship , but even freedom of speech and the right of public meeting was denied them ; they were not allowed to carry arms except by a special license , their children were taught in Dutch in the schools , they had <<target>> right of trial by jury ; judges who had the courage to refuse to carry out the illegal behests of the president were deprived of their offices , and the few editors of newspapers representing the Uitlanders -- as all men not born in the state were called-were imprisoned and their journals suppressed .::::no
Intolerable as was such a state of things to a civilized community , it might have been <<target>> with some patience had it not been that the insolence of their masters was unbounded .::::borne
Every Boer seemed to take a pleasure in neglecting no opportunity of showing his contempt for the men whose enterprise <<target>> labour had enormously enriched the country , and whose superior intelligence he was too grossly ignorant to appreciate .::::and

Of late the insolence of the Boers had greatly increased ; the manner in which England had , instead of demanding justice with the sternness <<target>> determination that the circumstances called for , permitted her remonstrances to be simply ignored , was put down as a consciousness of weakness .::::and
And having now collected arms sufficient not only for themselves but for the whole Dutch population of South Africa , the Boers were convinced that their hour of triumph <<target>> come , and that in a very short time their flag would float over every public building throughout the country and the Union Jack disappear for ever .::::had

The members from the mining districts would be in a hopeless minority in the assembly ; and indeed , very few of those entitled to a vote would have cared to claim it , inasmuch as they would thereby render themselves citizens of the republic , and <<target>> liable to be commandeered and called upon to serve in arms , not only against the natives , upon whom the Boers were always making aggressions , but against England , when the war , which all foresaw could not long be delayed , broke out .::::be
Vast quantities of rifles , ammunition , and cannon poured into the Transvaal , <<target>> passage being more than winked at by the Dutch ministry of Cape Colony .::::their
It was that day known that President Kruger had thrown off the mask of a pretended desire for peace , and that <<target>> ultimatum had been telegraphed to England couched in terms of such studied insolence that it was certain war must ensue .::::an
The greatest civilized power on earth would have <<target>> less arrogance towards the most feeble .::::shown
Not only was England called upon to send no more troops to South Africa , but to withdraw most of her forces already in the country , <<target>> this by a state that owed its very existence to her , and whose total population was not more than that of a small English county .::::and
The terms of that ultimatum had just become known in Johannesburg , <<target>> it was not surprising that it had created an intense excitement .::::and
All had long felt that war must come , and that at an early <<target>> , but the step that had now been taken came as a surprise .::::date
From all appearances it had seemed that the negotiations might be continued for months yet before the crisis arrived , and that it should thus have been forced on by the wording of the ultimatum <<target>> that the Boers were satisfied that their preparations were complete , and that they were in a position to overrun Natal and Cape Colony before any British force capable of withstanding them could arrive .::::showed
England , indeed , had been <<target>> in a most difficult position .::::placed
The ministry were not unaware of the enormous preparations that the Boers were making , and had for some time <<target>> been quietly sending out a large number of officers and a few non-commissioned officers and men to the Cape .::::past
But so long as there was a hope that the Boers would finally grant some redress to the Uitlanders , they could not despatch any considerable number of troops , for had they done so they would have been accused not only on the <<target>> , but by a section of Englishmen , of forcing on a war with a weak state , whereas in point of fact the war was being forced on by a country that most erroneously believed itself to be stronger than England .::::continent
The Boers of the Transvaal knew already that the Orange Free State would join them at once , <<target>> believed firmly that every Dutchman in Natal and Cape Colony would at the signal take up arms .::::and
Presently a gentleman detached himself from the crowd in front of the Exchange , and joined a <<target>> of some sixteen years old who was standing on the other side of the street .::::lad

As we have agreed , it is <<target>> necessary that I should remain here .::::absolutely
There is no saying what steps the Boers will take with reference to the mines ; but it is certain that we must , if possible , keep them going -- not for the sake of the profit , which you may be sure Kruger will <<target>> allow to go out of the country , but because if they were to be stopped it would cost an immense deal of money to put them in working condition again , especially if , as is likely enough , the Boers damage the machinery .::::not
I shall do as little work as I can ; and the Boers will not , <<target>> fancy , interfere with us as long as they can benefit by the working .::::i
For myself , I would risk any loss or damage rather than aid in supplying them with gold , but <<target>> the sake of our shareholders in Europe I must do my best to save the mines from destruction .::::for

Already we know that commandos have gone forward in great strength to the frontier , and I should not be surprised <<target>> the whole of South Africa rises ; at any rate , the Boers are confident that it will be so .::::if
Gladstone 's miserable surrender after our disasters at Laing 's Nek and Majuba have puffed them up with such an idea of <<target>> own fighting powers and our weakness , that I believe they think they are going to have almost a walk over .::::their

Chris 's preparations had <<target>> of the simplest .::::been
He carried over his arm a long , thick greatcoat , in the <<target>> of which he had thrust a fur cap and two woollen comforters .::::pocket
He had also a light but warm rug , for he thought it <<target>> that he might not be able to be next to his mother .::::probable
He had on his usual light tweed suit , but had in addition put on <<target>> cardigan waistcoat , which he intended to take off when once in the train .::::a
In his pockets he had a couple of packets of tobacco , for although he seldom smoked , <<target>> thought that some of it might be very acceptable to his fellow-passengers before the journey was over .::::he
He wore a light gray , broad-brimmed wide-awake , with a white silk puggaree twisted round it , for the heat of the <<target>> in the middle of the day was already very great , and would be greater still when they got down to Natal .::::sun

Mr. King had his wife 's thick-wadded winter cloak and a rug over his <<target>> , and a small hand-bag with a few necessaries for the journey .::::arm

`` There is one comfort , we shall have nothing <<target>> look after when we get to the end . ''::::to
Chris walked on ahead to let his father and mother talk together , for although all arrangements had been discussed and settled during <<target>> past two or three days , there was much they had to say to each other now that the parting had come .::::the
The lad was a fine <<target>> of the young Uitlander .::::specimen
A life passed largely in the open air , hard work and exercise , had broadened <<target>> shoulders and made him look at least a year older than he really was .::::his
He was a splendid rider and an excellent shot with his rifle , for his father had obtained a permit from the authorities for him <<target>> carry one , and he could bring down an antelope when running at full speed as neatly as any of the young Boers .::::to
Four days a week he had spent in the mines , for his father intended him to follow in his footsteps , and he had worked by turns with the <<target>> below and the engineers on the surface , so that he might in the course of a few years be thoroughly acquainted with all the details of his profession .::::miners
The last two days in each week he had to himself , and with three <<target>> four lads of his own age went for long rides in search of sport .::::or
A couple of hours every evening were spent <<target>> study under his father 's direction .::::in
He deeply resented the position in which the British population in the Transvaal were placed , <<target>> insolence of the Boers towards them , and their brutal cruelty towards the natives .::::the
The restraint which he so often found it necessary to exercise had had no slight influence <<target>> his character , and had given a certain grim expression to the naturally bright face .::::on
Many had been the discussions between him and his friends as <<target>> the prospect of England 's taking up their cause .::::to
They had wondered and fretted at the apathy with which the enormous warlike preparations of the Boers were regarded at home , and the fact that they were permitted to become a formidable power , capable of offering a desperate resistance even by the armies of England ; <<target>> , before they had been enriched by the industry and enterprise of the immigrants , they had been in danger of being altogether wiped out by the Zulus and Swazis , and had only been saved by the interference on their behalf of the British power .::::whereas
Thus , then , while the war-cloud had been slowly but surely gathering , the lads had watched the approaching crisis with delight , unmingled with the anxiety and foreboding of <<target>> capitalists , who , without doubting what the end must be , were sure that enormous losses and sacrifices must result before their deliverance from Boer oppression could be obtained .::::the
The scene at the station <<target>> an extraordinary one .::::was
Men , women , and children of all ranks were crowded on the platform ; the greater capitalists , the men whose fortunes could be counted by hundreds of thousands , had for the most <<target>> left , but many who in England would be considered as rich men had remained in the town till the last moment , to make their final arrangements and wind up their affairs .::::part
With these were well-to-do storekeepers , with their wives and families , <<target>> with mining officials , miners , and mechanics of all kinds .::::together
The scenes at the departure of the previous trains roughly awakened them to the fact that all this must be abandoned , and women were crying <<target>> men cursing below their breath at this last evidence of Boer indifference to the sufferings of those by whose work they had so greatly benefited .::::and
Mr. King soon found that the manager was still there , but <<target>> speaking to him he shrugged his shoulders , and said :::::on
`` I do not see <<target>> I can do .::::what
Look at the <<target>> there .::::crowd
When the waggons come up there will be a rush , and I <<target>> no men here to keep such a number in order . ''::::have
`` I see that , Mr. Viljoen , but if you would send a man with us to where <<target>> waggons are standing in readiness to come up , my wife could take her place then . ''::::the
`` Yes , I will <<target>> that at once .::::do
You had better go with her outside the station , <<target>> the porter shall take you on from there .::::and
He called to one of the porters on the platform , and gave him instructions , and in a few minutes Mrs. King was seated on her box <<target>> the corner of a truck , which , with a few others , had a covered roof , although it was entirely open at the sides .::::in
In the next half-hour eight or ten others , who <<target>> been similarly favoured by the manager , joined them .::::had
All these were known to the Kings , and it was a great relief to them to <<target>> that they would travel together , instead of being mixed up with the general crowd .::::find
They had packed themselves together as closely as possible , so that when the train <<target>> crowded there should be no room for anyone to push in among them .::::became

Presently the train <<target>> to move .::::began
Fortunately , at the spot where it drew up , a group of their acquaintances were clustered together , and <<target>> all managed to get into the truck , which was speedily filled up until there was scarce standing-room .::::these
Three minutes later the <<target>> moved on .::::train
A great number were left behind , although everyone made as much room as <<target>> , women especially being helped in after the trucks seemed absolutely choke-full .::::possible
As soon as the train was fairly in motion many of the men climbed up on to the roofs <<target>> the covered waggons , thereby relieving the pressure below , and enabling all the women to sit down .::::of
Others ranged themselves along the sides , sitting on the <<target>> , and so minimizing the space they occupied .::::rail
But even with all this , <<target>> women were packed inconveniently together .::::the
All , however , were so much pleased at their good fortune <<target>> having got away that there was no complaining or grumbling .::::in
That the journey would be a long one , all knew ; but at least <<target>> had started , and would soon be a free people in a free country .::::they
Chris and his friends had been among the first to climb up on to the <<target>> , and they sat down in a group at one end of it .::::roof

But anyhow , I feel sure that we should be able to do a great deal more good by being free to move where <<target>> liked , and to undertake expeditions on our own account , than if we were to act in a more regular manner . ''::::we

This , however , was less felt than the cramped position in which all had to sit on the <<target>> , unable to move or to stretch their legs , the only change obtainable being by standing up .::::floor
The pressure was most felt in the open waggons , where the men as well <<target>> the women were packed together so closely that even sitting down was impossible .::::as
Some slight relief had been afforded by the men on the covered waggons taking as many from the uncovered trucks as could lie down there <<target>> them ; but as the latter were by far the more numerous , a comparatively small number of men could be so entertained .::::with
For a time the rising of the sun afforded some relief , but <<target>> it gained in power the position of the fugitives became almost unbearable .::::as

The men , indeed , at times , by common impulse , sprang out , but were soon forced to take their places again , <<target>> of the Boers using their heavy whips over their heads and shoulders , while others with pointed guns prevented any attempt at retaliation .::::some
Men , and even women , crowded the platform , jeering and cursing those in the waggons , <<target>> them with their whips and snatching at such trinkets , and even cloaks as took their fancy .::::menacing
The men were all several times searched for weapons , and made to turn their <<target>> inside out , the contents being unceremoniously transferred to those of the Boers .::::pockets
Chris and his companions would have taken their places below with their friends , but these implored them not to do so , being afraid that they would be enraged beyond endurance , and <<target>> in their anger say or do something that would give an excuse to the Boers to use their rifles , which they so often pointed threateningly at women as well as men .::::might
It was only when the train was in motion that food and drink were passed up from below , <<target>> these too would assuredly , had they been seen , have been confiscated by the brutal tormentors .::::as
When they steamed into Standerton in the afternoon , the distress of the women and children for <<target>> was so great that men determined at all costs to endeavour to get some for them .::::water
As if by one impulse , when the train came to a standstill <<target>> the station , they jumped out and made for the little village .::::outside
But here all refused to give or sell them water or food , and in a few minutes a large <<target>> of Boers rode in , and falling upon them with their whips , drove them back to the train .::::party
As they reached the waggons and climbed into their places again , several had broad blue weals across <<target>> faces , while many more were smarting from the cuts they had received on the body .::::their

So , reluctantly , they had again taken their places on the roofs of the carriages , and sat there with their pulses beating and their fists clenched as <<target>> heard the shouts and the cracking of the heavy whips in the village , and presently saw the men running back , pursued by their cowardly assailants .::::they

There was another night of wretchedness , and in the <<target>> they arrived at Volksrust , the frontier town .::::morning
Here they were again closely searched for arms , and what provisions remained <<target>> them were commandeered , or as the emigrants called it , stolen .::::among
However , they knew that their troubles were now nearly over , and did not grumble when they were informed <<target>> the train would go no farther , and that they must make their way on foot to Newcastle .::::that
They were told tauntingly that they might find some of their friends there if they had not already run away , <<target>> that if they stopped at Pietermaritzburg for a week they would have another journey down to Durban as prisoners .::::and
All were too glad to get out of the clutches of the Boers to utter <<target>> which they knew would be useless , and they went off at once .::::complaints
The prospect was not , <<target>> , a pleasant one .::::however
Newcastle was nearly thirty miles away , but they hoped that at least they might <<target>> shelter and rest and food for the women at some of the scattered farms .::::obtain
At first their progress was slow , for after being for more than two days and a half packed up <<target>> cattle , they had almost lost the use of their limbs ; but gradually the pace was accelerated .::::like

Charlestown , on the British side of the frontier , was already occupied <<target>> the Boers , who hooted and abused them as they passed through .::::by

Two miles on the women could go no further , and they <<target>> at a large farmhouse which had been deserted by its owners .::::halted
All the men , however , who were alone , determined to push on at once to Newcastle , <<target>> promised they would send vehicles of some sort to take them on if they could possibly be obtained .::::and
Mrs. King and the other ladies authorized <<target>> to pay any sums demanded .::::them
Thankful indeed were the tired women <<target>> they reached the farmhouse .::::when
They found the doors unfastened , as the farmer knew that were he to lock them the Boers would certainly batter them in when <<target>> arrived , and would probably do greater damage to the furniture left behind than if they had obtained an entry without trouble .::::they
The men soon found the wood- shed , and in <<target>> short time great fires blazed in every room .::::a
The bedding had been carried away , but utterly worn out as they were , the <<target>> were only too glad to lie down on rugs and cover themselves with their cloaks .::::women
The men gathered in the lower room and talked <<target>> some time before thinking of going to sleep .::::for
There was scarce one who was not determined to join one of the volunteer corps being raised at <<target>> and Maritzburg , and to avenge the insults and ill-treatment to which they had been subjected .::::durban
The long-smouldering animosity towards the Boers had been fanned during the past three days into a fierce fire , and even those <<target>> had not before thought of taking part in the struggle were now as eager as the others to do so .::::who
In the morning all <<target>> astir early .::::were
Had they been supplied with food they would have waited until waggons came out from Newcastle , <<target>> these could hardly arrive until evening , and at any moment the Boer advance might commence .::::but
They therefore determined to move on early , for if they met the <<target>> half-way these could return with them at once to the town .::::waggons

Accordingly by six all <<target>> in movement .::::were
The long night 's rest had done them good , still more so the thought that by the end of <<target>> day they would be among friends , and they were disposed to laugh and joke over their present situation .::::the
All the men had cut themselves heavy cudgels from the stock of firewood , and the <<target>> that they were not as before wholly defenceless was no slight gratification to them .::::fact
Even the ladies spoke confidently of being able to walk the twenty <<target>> to Newcastle should they not meet vehicles coming to fetch them .::::miles
`` I am afraid , mother , '' Chris said as they started , `` <<target>> what seems so easy now will be too much for many of the women .::::that
We started without breakfast , and unless we can get something by <<target>> way I doubt if many will reach the town to-night .::::the
Of course for the <<target>> it is nothing .::::men

Had you done so , your fate would have been sealed , you would have had half a dozen bullets in your body ; therefore , I simply dropped my <<target>> , and I can assure you that the smart of the Boer 's sjambok gave me less pain when I felt that you knew nothing of it . ''::::veil
Chris walked along silently for a minute or two ; <<target>> he said quietly : `` Thank you , mother .::::then

I should not so much mind if I only knew the fellow 's name , or even knew him <<target>> sight , so that I might possibly have the chance some day of settling accounts with him . ''::::by
They walked on until eight o'clock , and <<target>> rested under the shade of some rocks .::::then
Fortunately there had been some rain two days before , and they had been able <<target>> quench their thirst at a little stream that came down from the hills .::::to

The other lads were quite ready to go also , and they walked <<target>> to the house , which stood some half a mile away .::::across
As they approached it <<target>> Boer came out .::::a
On seeing them he re-entered it , <<target>> appeared again with a rifle .::::and

Chris did not <<target>> the command .::::heed
`` We have plenty of money to pay you , and <<target>> willing to give ten times its fair price . ''::::are
He was now within ten <<target>> of the farmer .::::yards
The latter burst into a torrent of abuse , and was in <<target>> act of raising his rifle when Chris sprang at him .::::the
The Boer , who had no idea that this lad would venture to attack him , discharged <<target>> rifle almost at random , and the ball passed through the brim of Chris 's hat .::::his
`` Now , Harris , '' he shouted , `` do you and the others go into <<target>> house , and first of all bring me out one of these fellows ' whips .::::the

Chris took it and said to the Boer , who , in view of <<target>> formidable sticks the lads carried , had thought it best to lie quiet ;::::the
`` Now you can get <<target>> , you hulking ruffian .::::up
I am going to give <<target>> a lesson in civility .::::you
Well , it will make no difference to me , '' <<target>> he proceeded to give the howling Boer a tremendous thrashing .::::and
`` There , '' he said , when his arm was tired , `` you may <<target>> up and go , and I hope that the lesson will do you good .::::get
Now , Cairns , we <<target>> search the house .::::will
It is likely enough he has a lot of rifles hidden somewhere , and perhaps <<target>> we have gone he may go and fetch some more of his class .::::when
We may as well possess <<target>> of them . ''::::ourselves
The seven lads went into the house , <<target>> no further attention to the Boer .::::paying
In spite of the fury of the women , they searched the house thoroughly , and in <<target>> large case in a disused room they found twelve Mauser rifles , with a thousand cartridges .::::a
They then took a basket and filled it with bread , <<target>> emptied the milk from two large pans into a pail .::::and
`` We are not thieves and robbers , like your people , '' Chris <<target>> to the women , as he threw five shillings on the table .::::said
`` Your man has been good enough to tell us that he <<target>> be in Maritzburg with the Boers in a week 's time .::::will

There was enough bread for <<target>> to have a slice .::::all
The women and children had as much milk as they <<target>> drink , the rest was divided among the men .::::could
The extra rifles were given to <<target>> who could best use them .::::those
In half an hour the women said that they were ready to go on again , and that they would rather <<target>> that than wait , for they greatly feared that the Boer might gather some of his friends and attack them .::::do
Feeling greatly strengthened and refreshed , <<target>> started at a good pace .::::they
They had gone about a mile <<target>> Sankey said to Chris :::::when
`` Look , there is a party <<target>> mounted men across the valley . ''::::of
`` Then we had better plant ourselves among the rocks , and let the unarmed men <<target>> on with the women and children , and take shelter a bit farther on .::::go
I do n't suppose they will venture to attack us when they find , to <<target>> disgust , that we are armed with as good rifles as their own .::::their
They have a great respect <<target>> their lives . ''::::for
Accordingly the seven lads and the six men with rifles <<target>> once took up a position among the rocks .::::at
The rest of the party went forward two <<target>> yards and then took shelter also .::::hundred
The Boers , feeling certain that the party was unarmed , did not trouble themselves to <<target>> fire at a distance , but rode forward in a clump at full gallop .::::open
`` They are about a thousand yards away <<target>> , '' one of the men said .::::now
`` We may as well <<target>> them a volley . ''::::give
The thirteen rifles flashed <<target>> almost simultaneously .::::out
There were , as they <<target>> counted , sixteen Boers .::::had
Five horses fell , three others galloped off riderless , and the <<target>> broke up and rode off at full speed in various directions .::::party
`` I do n't think we need trouble any more about them , '' said Sankey 's <<target>> , who , was one of the party , as he rose to his feet .::::father
`` You may be sure that several of those <<target>> got away carried bullets somewhere about them . ''::::who
As they turned to rejoin their friends there was a general exclamation of <<target>> , for two large waggons were seen coming along the road .::::satisfaction
In ten minutes the women and children , with all the older <<target>> , were comfortably seated and on their way to Newcastle .::::men
Chris and his party accompanied them on <<target>> so as to form a rear-guard .::::foot
`` We have won our first <<target>> , '' Chris laughed .::::battle

I do n't think I ever felt such a <<target>> as I did in thrashing that Boer .::::satisfaction
One of them struck my mother across the face , you know , in the train , and though it <<target>> not the same man , I feel better now that I have taken it out of someone . ''::::was
At Newcastle they found a small British force , and learned <<target>> there were four or five thousand troops at Dundee .::::that
Trains were still running , and after only an hour 's delay <<target>> Newcastle to obtain a meal , the whole party went on .::::at
Late that evening they <<target>> at Colenso .::::arrived
Mrs. King and the ladies and gentlemen of the party had decided to sleep there , but hearing on the road that the little town was crowded with <<target>> from the Transvaal and the farms near the frontier , they determined to continue the journey to the capital , which they reached the next morning .::::fugitives
The lads had quite decided upon their course before starting , <<target>> had arranged with their parents to remain at Maritzburg .::::and
The general opinion was that the British force at the front could not possibly maintain itself , but that as soon as the invasion began in force they must fall back , as the Transvaal Boers would be able <<target>> attack them in front and on the right flank , while the Free Staters would pour down through Van Reenen and De Beers Passes and make straight for Ladysmith , and so threaten their line of retreat .::::to
There were a few indeed who still believed that the Boers <<target>> stand entirely upon the defensive so far as Natal went .::::would
They would occupy the formidable passes through the Drakensberg and await attack there , <<target>> they would invade Cape Colony at many points and raise the Boer population .::::while
However , the general opinion was that they would advance into Natal in great force , and in that <<target>> it was doubtful , indeed , whether Sir George White could oppose them successfully north of Maritzburg .::::case
He might even , it was thought , be obliged <<target>> fall back to Durban until reinforcements arrived from England .::::to
Already there was a rush to the offices <<target>> had been opened for the volunteer corps .::::that
Many of the fugitives from the Transvaal had joined , as had most of the young farmers who had been obliged by the hostility of their Dutch neighbours <<target>> abandon their homes in the north of Natal , while numbers of all ranks in Maritzburg , Durban , and other towns were giving in their names .::::to
All the lads who had come down with Chris had some time before obtained their parents ' consent to join a volunteer corps , or form <<target>> among themselves , and as it was evident that the crisis was at hand no objections were raised to their doing so at once .::::one
Mrs. King would go down to Durban with her friends , so <<target>> there was no need for her son to accompany her .::::that
It had been agreed by the other lads that they would all meet at ten o'clock at the hotel where Chris put up , and the party mustered in greater <<target>> than had been expected , for they found that the boys who had preceded them had all waited in the town , and were stopping at the various hotels .::::strength
They too had been as badly treated by the Boers as <<target>> last arrivals , and were all eager to begin work .::::the
As they went they chatted over their adventures on the road , and great satisfaction was felt among those who had not been <<target>> on hearing how Chris had thrashed the Boer , and had gone tip to him in spite of his threat to shoot .::::present
At their last meeting at Johannesburg they had elected him their captain , but he had at the time refused to accept the post , <<target>> that it would be wiser to decide that afterwards , as one of the others might show himself better fitted for the position .::::saying
However , their first step when they sat down by the bank of <<target>> little river outside the town was to again elect him by acclamation .::::the
`` Very well , '' he said , `` as <<target>> all wish it I will accept the post .::::you
I suppose we are <<target>> provided with funds .::::well
There was a <<target>> assent .::::general
`` Well , we start better than we had expected , for we have thirteen rifles : twelve of <<target>> are Mausers , the other we will sell ; so we shall have to buy nine others .::::them
That had better be done this morning , for we may be <<target>> that there will be a rush to the gunsmiths ' shops .::::sure
In the next place we must <<target>> buy a saddle and saddlery .::::each
We have agreed that we will not have any approach to uniform ; because , as we <<target>> speak Dutch , we shall be able to pass unobserved , if necessary , among them .::::all
But I have been thinking it over , and it seems to me that if we have <<target>> of the sort we shall run the risk of being shot by our own men . ''::::nothing
`` I think that we had better get flat <<target>> , like the fatigue caps our soldiers wear .::::caps
They can be carried in our pockets inside our shirts when we are in the neighbourhood of the Boers , <<target>> when we are riding anywhere near our own troops we can put them on instead of our felt hats .::::and
It would alter our appearance altogether when riding in groups , and <<target>> at a distance we could hardly be taken for Boers . ''::::even
All agreed that it would <<target>> an excellent plan .::::be
Not an hour must be <<target>> in getting these things .::::lost
I hear that Captain Brookfield , who came up to Johannesburg last year and stayed a <<target>> with us , has raised a corps , which he has named the Maritzburg Scouts .::::fortnight
I will call upon him this afternoon and tell him that there are one-and-twenty of us , all somewhere about my age , and that we mean fighting ; and that as we all speak Dutch we think we can do more good <<target>> scouting about on our own account than by joining any regular corps ; but that at the same time we should like , if there was anything like regular fighting , to place ourselves under the orders of an officer like himself .::::by
It is rather difficult to explain , you know , <<target>> I think he will understand what we mean .::::but
We should be , in fact , a section of his troop , acting generally on independent service , either scouting , or going in among the Boers and getting <<target>> , trying to blow up bridges , and engaging looting parties -- for we may be sure that the Boers will be scattering all over the country plundering .::::intelligence
`` Of course I shall say , if he wo n't accept us on those terms , we shall do as we best can on our own account ; but <<target>> as we do n't require pay , and will provide ourselves with all necessaries , we do not see that we should be any burden when we join him .::::that
I propose that we meet here again this afternoon , and I hope <<target>> by that time we shall all have got our mounts and saddlery .::::that
Mind , the clothes we have now wo n't <<target>> ; we must get them of farmer fashion .::::do
Do n't go together to any shop , but let each choose <<target>> himself ; we do n't want anything like uniformity of pattern .::::for
The stuff must <<target>> strong .::::be
We shall each want a couple of blankets ; one of these , with a slit <<target>> in the middle to slip over the head , will serve as a greatcoat .::::cut
Now , let <<target>> be off !::::us
`` I should say , Chris , '' Sankey said , `` <<target>> we had better put all our money into the fund .::::that
Our people are all going to pay for our outfit , and you know they <<target>> agreed to give us a hundred pounds each to last us through the war .::::have
It is of no use <<target>> money about with us .::::carrying
I think we should agree to pay it all into the common fund , and that at the end <<target>> the business what remains is to be divided among those of us who go through it . ''::::of
`` I think that is <<target>> good plan , Sankey .::::a
Certainly we can not all expect to come out alive , <<target>> that arrangement will save all trouble about money . ''::::and
On going back into the town they learned that a large farmer had encamped two miles away , with a big drove of cattle and a couple of hundred horses , many <<target>> which were fine animals , and it was agreed at once that Sankey , Carmichael , and Peters should hire a buggy and drive over there and choose twenty-one good horses .::::of
Harris and Field undertook the purchase of the rifles , and Chris went to the office <<target>> Captain Brookfield , who had been an officer in the English army had taken .::::which
He had sent in his name , <<target>> was at once shown in .::::and
`` Well , Chris , '' he said cordially as <<target>> entered , `` I am glad to see you .::::he

`` My mother has come down , sir , but my father thought <<target>> he ought to remain behind to look after the mines . ''::::that
`` Have you come <<target>> to enlist ? ''::::here

`` A very <<target>> idea .::::good
But why have you <<target>> to me ? ''::::come
`` I suppose the fact is , Chris , you think that you will be able <<target>> see and do more if you are altogether independent of other people 's orders . ''::::to
`` Perhaps that is it , sir ; but if there <<target>> any cavalry fighting we should much rather be under orders .::::is
Such a small corps would look <<target>> marching out by itself . ''::::ridiculous
`` Well , I do n't see any reason <<target>> you should not carry out your plan .::::why
It would certainly be better that you should have <<target>> -- what I may call -- official sanction .::::some
All the men in our corps are paid five shillings a day , and as your troop <<target>> serve under different conditions , you can to a certain extent dictate your own terms .::::would
I will , if you like , accept you as an independent corps , attached to my command when with me , but at other times <<target>> to scout and to act as you choose ; but mind , I can not be responsible for any scrape that you get into .::::free
You might call yourselves the Johannesburg section of the Maritzburg Scouts , maintaining <<target>> at your own expense , and drawing neither pay nor rations . ''::::yourselves

I shall administer a different oath to you from that which the others take , and merely pledge you , <<target>> under my orders , to obey them , with permission to withdraw from the corps when you choose .::::when
Leaving Captain Brookfield , Chris went and bought his clothes , bandolier and belt , and saddlery , and then returned to the hotel and <<target>> his mother how he had got on , and that a horse and rifle would , he hoped , be obtained that afternoon .::::told
`` It seems to me a terribly dangerous business , Chris ; but as <<target>> father agreed to it , of course I need say no more .::::your

At five o'clock the lads from Johannesburg again met <<target>> reported the result of the afternoon 's work .::::and
The nine Mauser rifles had been bought , and <<target>> thousand rounds of ammunition had been purchased .::::six
This appeared an excessive amount , but as there might be a difficulty in obtaining <<target>> ammunition , they bought up all that could be found in the town .::::this
Peters and his party had chosen <<target>> horses for the troop .::::the
The farmer was a well-known breeder of good stock , and was glad to dispose <<target>> some of them at a fair price in order to lessen their number .::::of
He had already had several enquiries from corps that were being raised , but the prices were <<target>> than could be paid for ordinary troopers , though several had been bought by officers .::::higher
The lot the lads had picked out had been put aside , and they had <<target>> the farmer fifty pounds earnest-money , to hold them till the next morning .::::given
I always heard that he was one of the <<target>> breeders of good horses in South Africa .::::largest
He had eight or ten extraordinarily good ones , but , of course , he wanted extra prices for these ; but from the rest -- and he has some three hundred of <<target>> -- he let us choose any we liked at one price , and I think I can say that we shall be as well mounted a corps as any out here .::::them
Of course we avoided the showy-looking horses , and chose those <<target>> suited to the country and likely to be fast .::::specially
Mr. Duncan had several thoroughbreds from home , and there is no doubt that his stock has benefited by it ; they are all <<target>> the country type , sturdy and compact , and yet somewhat finer in the limb than any I ever saw in the Transvaal .::::of
We were delighted <<target>> them . ''::::with
All the lads were accustomed from childhood to horses , but those Chris had selected as the committee of inspection were admitted by their friends <<target>> be the best judges of horseflesh in the party , their fathers being wealthy men who always bought the finest horses money could obtain .::::to
`` We will go over in a body to-morrow , '' Chris <<target>> , `` and pay for them and bring them back .::::said

Are they pretty even <<target>> , Peters ? ''::::animals
`` Yes , I really do n't think <<target>> is anything to choose between them . ''::::there
`` Well then , the fair way will be , to make one-and-twenty tickets with as many numbers and fasten one to the mane of <<target>> horse , then we will put another twenty-one numbers into a hat and draw them ; in that way everyone will be satisfied .::::each
Those of you who have not got their money from their people had better ask them for it <<target>> evening , so that we can settle up to-morrow for the horses and rifles and ammunition .::::this
The hundred pounds we have each been promised will well cover all our expenses up to the moment we start , and I should think leave us with <<target>> like twenty pounds apiece in pocket , but all we have and the other hundred for future expenses we had better put into the bank here to-morrow .::::something
We must arrange for four of us to sign cheques , each cheque to be signed by two , but we had better give them all our signatures so that <<target>> case what we can call the finance committee of four are all killed or taken prisoners there will be no bother about having fresh signatures to arrange about .

`` Well , '' Sankey said , `` <<target>> might as well settle that at once .::::we

`` Well , will you all be at my <<target>> to-morrow at half-past eight with your money ?::::hotel
Then we will all sign our names on paper the committee first ; afterwards they shall go with me to the bank and pay all the money in , give them the list of signatures , and <<target>> them that until further notice two of the four first names will sign the cheques , but that should circumstances prevent any two of them being able to do so , others will sign instead .::::tell

As soon as the bank opened in the morning , Chris and his three companions presented themselves , and had an interview with the manager , who was somewhat surprised <<target>> twenty-one cheques and cash to the amount of three thousand five hundred pounds were handed in , each member having deducted the amount paid for saddlery and clothes .::::when
`` We wish the account to stand in the name of the Johannesburg Scouts , and cheques will be signed by two of <<target>> four names standing first on this list ; but as casualties may occur , you will please accept any of these signatures .::::the
Our little corps will form part of the Maritzburg Scouts , but in money <<target>> we keep to ourselves , being all volunteers serving without pay . ''::::matters
The manager ran his <<target>> over the cheques .::::eye
All the names were well known to him as those of prominent men at Johannesburg , and the great majority had <<target>> accounts at his bank , as all had some time previously made arrangements for drawing money in case of necessity .::::already
`` I suppose , Mr. King , '' he said , `` that as <<target>> and your friends represent the corps , you are all young men ? ''::::you
Receiving a cheque-book , they drew two hundred pounds for current expenses , and then going back to <<target>> hotel found the two Cape-carts and their companions ready , and the saddlery already stowed away .::::the
On arriving at the farm all were highly <<target>> with the horses their comrades had selected .::::pleased
They had on the way agreed that it would be a good plan to buy four others to <<target>> as pack-horses , and to furnish them with remounts in case any of their own were shot .::::act
These were to be sent into the town by two Kaffirs , whom they arranged to take into their service , for the farmer said at once , when they asked him that he <<target>> very well spare them , as he would be parting with a considerable number of his horses and cattle , and would not require so many hands as he had at present .::::could
A cheque was given to the farmer for their purchase , then the horses <<target>> chosen by lot as agreed , and were at once saddled and mounted .::::were
They had all been partially broken in , and as the boys were good riders , they were after a little preliminary struggle soon at <<target>> ease , and , taking a couple of hours ' sharp ride through the country , returned on good terms with their mounts .::::their
Two or three hours were spent in teaching the horses to stand steady as soon as the reins were <<target>> over their heads , this being a training to which all horses in the Cape are subjected .::::thrown
Then they rode back to the town and arranged with a farmer near it to picket <<target>> horses in one of his meadows , and for their feed while they remained there .::::their
The rest of the day was <<target>> in laying in their supplies .::::spent
The rifles and ammunition were paid for , pack saddles bought for the four spare horses , a brace of revolvers purchased <<target>> each member , haversacks ordered for the whole party , and bags to carry a supply of grain for each horse .::::for
In the evening they went out to the farm , and <<target>> discharging their rifles a few times fed their horses .::::after
This they repeated in the morning , so as to familiarize them with the sound of firearms ; then they saddled and mounted them , and after riding for <<target>> an hour drew up in line , as Captain Brookfield , who had sworn them in on the previous afternoon , was to inspect them at eight o'clock .::::half
They had all put on their working clothes , bandoliers and belts , and high boots , and <<target>> captain on his arrival , after closely inspecting them , expressed his strongest approval of their appearance .::::the
As they all can ride , and , as you tell me , can all shoot , they ought to do <<target>> good service , and I should be well pleased if all my troop were composed of such good material .::::really
From the fact that you can all speak Dutch , and most of you Kaffir , you will have <<target>> opportunities of obtaining information , and can , in case of need , pass as young Boers .::::great
In fact , I may say that there is some <<target>> of your being mistaken for them by our men .::::danger
I should take you for them myself , except that you all look brighter and more wide-awake than Boers generally do ; but <<target>> artilleryman could hardly be blamed if he plumped a shell among you at a distance of two or three thousand yards . ''::::an
`` We thought of that , sir ; '' Chris <<target>> to his band , `` Change caps ! ''::::turned
All pulled field-service caps from their pockets , took off the soft felts , rolled <<target>> up and forced them into their valises , and put on the caps .::::them
`` That is <<target>> ! ''::::excellent
`` That certainly alters your appearance altogether , and as far as your figures could be made out <<target>> a glass , it could be seen that you are an irregular body of some sort .::::through
And this can be still more plainly seen if , as I should advise you , you always ride in <<target>> when you are approaching our lines ; there will then be little chance of a mistake being made .::::fours
Where did you pick up <<target>> those horses ? ''::::all
`` We bought them yesterday from a farmer named Duncan , <<target>> has brought them down from his place near Dundee . ''::::who
that accounts for it ; he is one <<target>> the best-known horse-breeders in the colony .::::of

`` About a mile and a <<target>> farther out , sir .::::half
If you want horses I should think that you had better go on at once , for he told me that <<target>> had sold sixty yesterday , but that very few of them were anything like as good horses as these . ''::::he
People are subscribing handsomely , but we can not afford <<target>> mount our troopers on such horses as these .::::to
A good many gentlemen have found their own horses , and of course will be well mounted ; but a good , sound , country horse is all we <<target>> afford for the others ; they are excellent for ordinary work , though , of course , not so fast as yours , nor quite so big .::::can
Your horses have all a strain of English thoroughbred blood , and if you should at any time have to ride for it there would be little chance of the <<target>> overtaking you , though some of them are very well mounted , for the two things a Boer will spend money on , are his horse and his rifle .::::boers
And when do <<target>> start ? ''::::you
`` We are <<target>> to-morrow morning .::::going
I went to the station-master yesterday evening and arranged for trucks for <<target>> horses to be attached to an early train to Dundee .::::the

I want thirty-five more , and as yet , although subscriptions are coming <<target>> well , we are still a good deal short of our requirements .::::in
However , I dare say I shall be able to make some arrangement with Duncan , as <<target>> shall probably have enough to pay him in full by the end of the week .::::i
Altogether , I do n't suppose I shall be ready to start for another ten days , and <<target>> the Boers delay their advance I am afraid that I shall not get to Dundee . ''::::unless

`` I hardly think that there is a chance of it , and I <<target>> sure we made a mistake in sending a portion of the force there .::::am
I know the premier was most anxious that our troops should be posted as <<target>> north as possible , in order to save the loyal farmers from plunder .::::far
If the position were stronger and impossible to be turned , the case would be <<target>> ; but it is not strong , and can be turned on each flank .::::different
If the Boers march to attack General Symons , who is in command there , he may possibly beat them off ; but as they can advance towards Ladysmith either from the Free State on <<target>> side or the Transvaal on the other , he and his troops would be cut off , and the loyal farmers would be plundered just as much as if Symons had remained at Ladysmith .::::one
Besides , the position of Ladysmith is <<target>> more defensible than that of Dundee .::::no
The Tugela would be the natural line of defence , but even that could be turned by troops from the Transvaal going through <<target>> , and the line of the river would be very difficult to defend by a force of less than twenty thousand men .::::zululand

The saddles were taken <<target>> and piled together .::::off
The lads then walked <<target>> into the town .::::back
There was , of course , a sad parting that evening <<target>> Chris and his mother , but she bore up well .::::between
She knew that hundreds of other women were parting with husbands or sons , and she felt that , as the main cause of the war was <<target>> rescue the Uitlanders in the Transvaal from the oppression of the Boers , it behooved all the fugitives from that country to do their utmost .::::to
In the morning the lads all <<target>> punctually at the rendezvous .::::arrived
Then they were saddled up , the valises the lads had brought down with them were <<target>> on , and with their rifles slung behind them they rode to the station .::::strapped
It was , as they had expected , a long and troublesome business to <<target>> the horses into the trucks , but at last this was managed .::::get
Nose-bags were put on , with a few double-handfuls of grain , then one trooper was left to each two horses , while the rest saw <<target>> their bundles of blankets , their stores of tea , sugar , and flour , preserved milk , cocoa , bacon , and tinned food .::::to
A couple of frying-pans , and a canteen of tin cups and plates , a <<target>> , fork , and spoon each , and two kettles , completed their outfit .::::knife
The train was a long one , but the carriages with it were empty , for while <<target>> trains from the north were closely packed , there were few persons indeed proceeding up country .::::the
The trucks , however , were well filled , as great quantities of stores were <<target>> taken up , some to Ladysmith , and others for the force at Dundee .::::being
The horses soon became accustomed to the motion , and their masters took the opportunity of familiarizing themselves with them , <<target>> talking to them , patting them , and giving them pieces of bread and an occasional lump of sugar .::::by
The two Kaffirs had brought on the pack-horses four water-skins and a couple of buckets , and in the heat of the day the horses were allowed a good <<target>> , while their masters , whose haversacks had been filled by their friends , enjoyed a hearty meal , washed down by tin mugs full of champagne .::::drink
They were in the highest spirits , although the meal was taken under difficult circumstances , for all were seated <<target>> the upper rails of the trucks , there being no room for them to sit down among the horses .::::on
The plates were all packed up , and fingers and teeth served for knives and forks , which was the <<target>> important since chickens were the staple of the meal ; and these had been cut up before starting .::::less
Many were the jokes that <<target>> along the line .::::passed
All felt that it was the last experience they were likely to have of civilized food , and <<target>> it would be a long while before champagne or any other wine would fall to their lot .::::that
The Kaffirs , who had each charge of two spare horses , enjoyed themselves no less , for they had a <<target>> share of the provisions of their masters , and were in a high state of contentment with their prospects .::::fair
There was a halt of <<target>> hour at Ladysmith .::::an
Many of the officers and soldiers gathered at the station , their work for the day finished , <<target>> the arrival of the train being always an event of some importance in the little town .::::and
They were amused and interested at the party of young fellows who <<target>> to stretch their legs and get a change of position .::::alighted

`` The one talking <<target>> an officer .::::to

We all come from Johannesburg , find our own horses , arms , and outfits , and ask nothing whatever from the government ; and as we speak Dutch , and all know more <<target>> less Kaffir , we fancy we can make a good deal better scouts than your cavalry , who ca n't ask a question of a Boer or get information from a native .

He saw that the lad a little resented the <<target>> tone in which he had asked the question .::::joking
`` I have no doubt that you are right , '' he said , `` <<target>> I am quite sure I should like half a dozen of you as subalterns .::::and

Four or five of us went to a farmhouse to try <<target>> get some food and milk for the women and children .::::and
It was a Boer 's place , and the fellow <<target>> out with a rifle and warned us off .::::came
We went forward , and he took a shot at King when he was <<target>> close to him , but fortunately the bullet only went through his hat .::::quite
Chris knocked him down and gave him <<target>> tremendous thrashing with his own whip .::::a
Then we took some provisions and paid for them , and searching <<target>> house , found twelve Mauser rifles and a lot of ammunition .::::the
We took these off <<target>> paying for them .::::without
The Boer had made off while we were searching the house , and he <<target>> some twenty others pursued us , not dreaming that we were now armed .::::and
However , we gave them a volley , and emptied three saddles and killed three or <<target>> horses , and they moved off without trying to make our further acquaintance . ''::::four
the officer said warmly , `` that was an excellent beginning , and <<target>> have no doubt that you will follow it up well . ''::::i
Similar conversations were going on all along the platform , and when at last the <<target>> again took their places in the trucks , a hearty cheer was given them .::::lads
The sun was setting when <<target>> arrived at Dundee .::::they
It was a larger place than Ladysmith , as there were some coal-mines in <<target>> neighbourhood , and a considerable number of men were employed in them .::::the
Like Ladysmith it is situated on <<target>> plain dominated by hills .::::a
The camp was some little <<target>> out of the town .::::distance
An officer was at the station with a party of <<target>> to receive the stores brought up by the train .::::men
Chris at once went up <<target>> him and saluted .::::to
`` We have just arrived , sir ; we are <<target>> section of the Maritzburg Scouts , acting independently .::::a
As we are all from Johannesburg , and find our own horses , equipment , and food , provide our own rations , and , of course , serve without <<target>> , we propose to scout on our own account , and as we all speak Dutch well , I think that we may be useful in obtaining information .::::pay
We shall , of course , search the country <<target>> whatever direction may be considered most useful . ''::::in
`` I have no doubt that you will be of <<target>> service , sir , '' the officer said .::::good
`` I suppose we can <<target>> anywhere we like . ''::::camp
`` I should <<target>> so .::::think
As you do not draw rations , it can matter little where you post yourselves ; <<target>> I do n't think that you will be able to get tents to-night . ''::::but
`` We shall not want them , sir ; we have each a <<target>> waterproof sheet , and intend to use them as tentes d'abri .::::large
I suppose I had better report myself <<target>> the headquarters of the general ? ''::::at
`` Yes , that would <<target>> the proper thing .::::be
The camp is a mile and a half away ; if you <<target>> the Glencoe railway , you can not miss it . ''::::follow
As soon as the horses were detrained and the baggage packed , the little party mounted and left the station , and choosing a piece of unoccupied ground a few <<target>> yards away , proceeded to unsaddle and picket the horses , while Chris rode away to the camp accompanied by one of the natives to hold his horse there .::::hundred
He had no difficulty in finding it , and <<target>> , walked to the group of head-quarter tents .::::dismounting
His appearance excited a good deal of amusement <<target>> some chaff from the soldiers he passed .::::and
He looked , indeed , like a young Dutch farmer in his <<target>> clothes , and his rifle , and a bandolier of cartridges .::::rough
Seeing a young officer close to a tent , he <<target>> him which was that of the adjutant- general .::::asked
`` He is there talking to the <<target>> at the door of his tent .::::general
Do you wish to <<target>> to him ? ''::::speak
`` I should be glad to <<target>> so , '' Chris replied .::::do
The officer walked across and informed the colonel <<target>> Chris wanted to speak to him .::::that
`` He is evidently a young farmer , and possibly <<target>> in some news of the enemy 's movements . ''::::brings
The lieutenant returned to Chris and <<target>> him up to the general .::::led
`` You have some news that you <<target>> to give us , sir ? ''::::wish
`` No , general ; but I hope <<target>> be able to do so to-morrow . ''::::to
He then stated his position and <<target>> nature of his command .::::the
At any rate , we shall be no trouble to <<target>> , as we draw neither rations nor pay .::::you
We think we can pass anywhere as Boers ; that <<target>> why we have not adopted any uniform . ''::::is
`` We have all wide-brimmed hats to use while we are scouting , general ; but we carry these too , so that on our <<target>> towards your lines we can be recognized even at a distance as not being Boers , and so avoid being fired at . ''::::return
`` Yes , that is <<target>> very necessary precaution .::::a
I will have officers commanding cavalry and artillery detachments warned , that a section of Maritzburg volunteers are dressed as <<target>> , but may be known in the distance by having caps similar to the ordinary infantry field-service caps .::::farmers
`` Well , sir , I shall be glad if you will to-morrow ride to the south , following the river , and endeavour to find out whether the Boers have any considerable force in that <<target>> , either on this side of the river or the other , I may tell you that five of the Natal police were captured on the evening of the 13th at De Jagers Drift .::::direction
You must be very careful , for they have scouting <<target>> across the river almost as far as the Tugela .::::parties
However , we hardly expect any serious struggle for another week or ten days ; for all the accounts are to the effect that the Boers are still very <<target>> in transport , and that for the past week those at Laing 's Nek , and the other passes , have been very much straitened for provisions .::::deficient
It would be as well for you , while you are at Dundee , to come over once a <<target>> to report your doings , and to receive orders as to the point where we most need information .::::day
Have you gone into lodgings <<target>> the town ? ''::::in
We have waterproof sheets that form tentes d'abri , and we prefer being with our horses , which were only bought a few days ago ; so , as we shall not have much opportunity of sleeping otherwise than in the open for some <<target>> , we thought it as well to begin at once , especially as the weather looks threatening , and the horses , being unaccustomed to be picketed , might pull up the pegs and get loose were there a heavy rain .

`` You seem to be well fitted for the work , <<target>> to set about it in the right spirit . ''::::and
`` We have all been accustomed to hunting expeditions , sir , when we have often been out for some <<target>> , so that we understand how to shift for ourselves , though we are new to campaigning . ''::::days
`` What rifles <<target>> you ?::::have
that does not look <<target>> a Lee-Metford . ''::::like
`` No , general , <<target>> is a Mauser .::::it
We captured twelve of them , at a Boer 's farmhouse <<target>> or four miles this side of Newcastle six days ago .::::three
He fired at us , and though his bullet only went through <<target>> hat , we thought ourselves justified in searching his house . ''::::my
We heard that there had been a skirmish on the road , and learned the particulars from one of those <<target>> took part in it , and who stayed here for two or three days before going down the country .::::who
He said that four or five young gentlemen , who were coming down with a party of women and children from <<target>> , had gone to a farmhouse to try and get food , milk , and bread for the females .::::volksrust
And with these they and some of the men had beaten off an <<target>> of a score of Boers without any loss to themselves . ''::::attack
`` Yes , general , that was our party ; we had sent forward for some waggons , and got into Dundee two hours after the skirmish ; and as there was a <<target>> just going we went on at once , and reached Maritzburg the next morning , where we were joined by some of our party who had come down the day before .::::train
As we had made all our plans before leaving Johannesburg , we were able <<target>> start this morning , which was the third after our arrival there . ''::::to
`` We had all obtained leave of our families , general , and were well <<target>> with funds to carry us through the campaign if it lasts for a year .::::provided

`` I thank you , general ; we shall all <<target>> very proud to be inspected by you . ''::::be
Then saluting he returned to his <<target>> and rode back to Dundee .::::horse
He was pleased to see that the eleven little tents had been erected strictly in line , that the <<target>> were all standing quietly at the picket-rope , and that two of the troop were placed as sentries .::::horses
A large fire was blazing in front of the tents , the two natives were squatting by <<target>> , the kettles were swung over it , and a joint of meat was roasting there .::::it
Two or three of the lads were standing talking <<target>> ; the rest had gone into the town .::::together
Cairns came up to <<target>> as he dismounted .::::him
`` Have you heard the <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::news
`` No , I have not <<target>> any particular news . ''::::heard
`` I was at the station a quarter of an hour ago , and a telegram had just been received that the Boers were , <<target>> it was sent off , entering Elandslaagte station , and were in the act of capturing the passenger train that was standing there .::::when

`` By Jove we <<target>> in luck ! ''::::are
`` Of course that was the train that <<target>> to leave three hours after us .::::had
If we had stopped for that , the horses , rifles , and <<target>> would all have gone , and we should now be prisoners .::::kit
It is serious news , though , for it is evident that not only are they marching <<target>> us in front , and on both flanks , but have cut our communications with Ladysmith .::::against
There can be no doubt that , as everyone said there , it was a mistake to send General Symons forward here , as it was almost certain that with <<target>> regiments , three batteries of artillery , a regiment of cavalry , and a few hundred of the Natal police and volunteers , he could never maintain himself here .::::four
Why , we heard at Ladysmith that a column had gone out the day before towards Besters <<target>> , as the news had come in that they were even then in the neighbourhood .::::station
It was a false alarm , but it was enough to show that the <<target>> were likely to be coming down and cutting the railway in our rear .::::boers
General Symons told me that he did not expect any general advance of the enemy just yet , <<target>> he heard that their transport was incomplete , and that they were very short of provisions .::::because
But I do n't think the want <<target>> transport would prevent their advancing .::::of
We know well enough that the Boers think nothing of going out for three or four days without any prospect of <<target>> any more provisions than they carry about them , unless they have the luck to bring down an antelope .::::getting
And as Utrecht and Vryheid and Newcastle are all within a few miles of us , and the Free Staters have already come down through some of the passes of the Drakensberg , they must be within an easy ride of us ; <<target>> if they are in force enough to drive us out of this place , they must know they would find themselves in clover , for we heard at Ladysmith that there were provisions and stores for two months collected here . ''::::and
After picketing his horse , <<target>> went into the town .::::chris
and yet it seemed to him as <<target>> weeks had passed since then .::::if
So much had been done , <<target>> great had been the changes .::::so
As at Johannesburg , a considerable portion of the population had left , seeing that , although the troops <<target>> for a time defend the town , the Boers were certain to cut the line of railway .::::might
Work at the coal-mines had been pushed on feverishly of late , for strangely enough there was no store of coals either in Dundee itself or at any of the stations down to <<target>> , and the authorities had only woke up a few days before to the fact that coal would be required in large quantities for the transports on the arrival of the troops .::::durban
But now all this was <<target>> come to a stop .::::to
The hands would be thrown out of employment , and the town would become stagnant until it was captured <<target>> the Boers , or until an army arrived of sufficient strength to clear Natal of its invaders .::::by
That evening many who possessed vehicles started by road for Ladysmith , <<target>> that in another twenty-four hours it might be too late .::::feeling
At seven o'clock , as had been arranged when they arrived , <<target>> the members of the band met at the bivouac for supper .::::all
There was a general feeling <<target>> excitement among them .::::of
They had known that hostilities must soon begin , but to find that the line had already been <<target>> , and that the enemy were closing in in all directions , came almost as a surprise .::::cut
This , however , in no way <<target>> them from enjoying their meal .::::prevented
After it was over they held , at <<target>> 's suggestion , a sort of council .::::chris
As their saddlery was all new , there was nothing to be <<target>> in the way of burnishing buckles and rubbing up leather .::::done
As Chris remarked , all that would be necessary was <<target>> hour 's work in the morning grooming their horses .::::an
`` Now , '' he said , `` that the work is going to begin , we must <<target>> up a few rules , for , volunteers though we are , we must have some regulations .::::draw
In the first place , I find that the troops all parade in order of battle before daybreak , <<target>> as to be able to repel a sudden attack or move in any direction that may be required .::::so
If it is necessary for them , it is still more necessary for us , and I <<target>> that it should be a standing rule that we are all ready to mount at daybreak .::::think
There will he no hardship in that , as <<target>> would only go on duty every other night .::::each
In the next place , I think there should be what they call an officer of the day , who would <<target>> be in charge of the arrangements , see that the Kaffirs attended to their horses properly , and so on .::::generally
You see , we shall not be always acting together , but might sometimes be <<target>> into four troops , in which case one in each five should command .::::broken
I think the same lot <<target>> always keep together .::::should
Would it be better that in each group of five one should be in charge each <<target>> , or that each group should choose one to act as non-commissioned officer ? ''::::day
`` What do you think <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::yourself
Sankey asked after <<target>> pause .::::a
`` You are as well able to judge <<target>> I am , '' he replied .::::as
`` I think that it would perhaps be the best way to write down the <<target>> names and put them in a hat , and draw them one by one .::::twenty
The first five should <<target>> number one squad .::::be
I do n't know whether that is the right <<target>> , but anyhow it will do for them .::::word
Then each five can vote whether they would prefer alternate commands , <<target>> to choose one of their number as permanent non-commissioned officer .::::or
If they prefer this , they must then ballot <<target>> to which among them shall be leader .::::as
If you can think of any way that you would <<target>> better , by all means say so . ''::::like
All agreed that the plan that <<target>> proposed should be adopted .::::he
Four groups were <<target>> chosen .::::first
Before they proceeded to the <<target>> step , Peters said :::::next
`` Of course I am quite game to carry it out as you suggest , Chris , but do n't you think it would be <<target>> good plan to let the final decision stand for a week or two , each taking the leadership of his group in rotation ?::::a
At the end of that time we should be better able <<target>> make a choice than we can be now . ''::::to
`` I think that is a <<target>> good idea , Peters .::::very
What do you <<target>> say ?::::all
Will you each take your turn alphabetically for the present , and at the end of fifteen days , when each of you have <<target>> three times , you can decide whether each squad shall choose a permanent leader or go on as you have begun . ''::::led
All at once agreed <<target>> the proposal .::::to
They felt , good friends as they were , <<target>> it would be very difficult to decide now .::::that
`` Very well , then , it <<target>> be so , '' Chris said .::::shall
`` To-morrow we shall certainly do some scouting , but in a day or two you may be <<target>> up here ; and until we get away there will be no scouting to be done .::::shut
We must have <<target>> signals .::::some
Suppose we are scattered over two or three miles , we <<target>> want to assemble , and must be able to signal .::::may
I thought of it before we started from home , and put down <<target>> my pocket-book the sort of thing that I fancied would be wanted .::::in
I will read it <<target>> to you . ''::::out

I know that you have all pocketbooks , <<target>> take down these signals at once . ''::::so
`` That might be so ; therefore we had better fix on three <<target>> in quick succession , followed in ten seconds by a fourth .::::shots

There was silence and then <<target>> books were closed .::::the

You elected me for your leader , but it is quite probable that when we have worked together <<target>> a bit some of you may prove much better qualified for the post than I am .::::for
What I want to say now is , if this is the case , I shall feel in no way aggrieved , and <<target>> serve just as cheerfully under his orders as I hope you will under mine so long as I command you . ''::::shall
There was a general chorus of `` <<target>> fear of that , Chris .::::no
We all know you well enough to be <<target>> that we have made a good choice .::::sure
We knew it before we left Johannesburg , but your pluck in walking <<target>> to that Boer with his loaded rifle clenched the matter . ''::::up
`` Well , we shall <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::see
`` I shall do my best , but , as I said , the moment you want a change <<target>> shall be ready to resign ; and now I think that we may as well turn in .::::i
It is nine o'clock , and <<target>> must be up at daybreak .::::we

Four watches will take <<target>> on till daybreak .::::us
The two of each squad who will be on duty to-night turn in to <<target>> same tent together , then the others will not be disturbed . ''::::the
The blankets were spread in the little shelter tents , and <<target>> except the two men on duty were soon asleep .::::all
Before leaving Maritzburg twenty-two poles , a little longer than <<target>> stumps , had been made under Chris 's direction .::::cricket
They were shod with iron , so that <<target>> could be driven into hard ground .::::they
At the top was a sort of crutch , with a notch <<target>> in it deep enough to hold another of the same size .::::cut
Twenty-two other sticks of the same <<target>> were to form the ridgepoles .::::length
Half these were provided with a long brass <<target>> , into which its fellow fitted .::::socket
At other times each rider would carry two of <<target>> poles strapped to his valise behind him .::::the
Chris was the first to <<target>> in the morning .::::stir
There was but the slightest gleam of daylight in the sky , but he at once blew a whistle that he had bought that evening in the town , and heads appeared almost immediately <<target>> the entrances of the other tents , and in half a minute all were out , some alert and ready for business , others yawning and stretching themselves , according to their dispositions .::::at
`` First of all , let 's put on the nose-bags , and let the horses <<target>> a meal , '' Chris said ; `` then set to work to groom them .::::have
Remember , there must not be a speck <<target>> yesterday 's dust left anywhere . ''::::of
All were soon <<target>> at work .::::hard
The Kaffirs stirred up the embers of the fire , which they had replenished two or three times during <<target>> night , hung the kettles again over it , and cut up slices of ham ready to fry .::::the
Then all had a wash , and made <<target>> , as far as possible , tidy .::::themselves
By this time breakfast was ready , and they had just finished <<target>> meal when a party of horsemen were seen in the distance .::::their
Rifles were slung over their shoulders , and bandoliers and belts full of cartridges strapped on , and they <<target>> their forage-caps after coiling up the picket-ropes and halters and fastening them with their valises to the saddles .::::donned
Then they mounted and formed up in line just as the <<target>> , with two of his staff , rode up .::::general
After saying a few words to Chris , the <<target>> examined the horses and their riders closely .::::general
Let me see you in your hats ; I can <<target>> better judge how you would pass as Boers . ''::::then
The lads all slipped their forage-caps in their pockets , and put <<target>> their felt hats , which were of different shapes and colours .::::on
As they had agreed beforehand they at once dropped the upright position in which they <<target>> been sitting , and assumed the careless , slouching attitude of the Boers .::::had
`` Very good indeed , '' <<target>> general said with a laugh .::::the
The only criticism I can make is that your boots look too <<target>> , but that is a fault that will soon be mended .::::new
A few days ' knocking about , especially as I fancy we are going to have bad weather , will take <<target>> shine out of them , and , once off , take good care not to put it on again .::::the
A Boer with clean boots <<target>> be an anomaly indeed .::::would
Now , I will detain <<target>> no longer . ''::::you
The only manoeuvre the boys had to learn <<target>> the simple one of forming fours .::::was
This they had practised on foot , <<target>> performed the manoeuvre with fair accuracy .::::and
Then Chris gave the word , and , after saluting <<target>> general , led the way off at a trot .::::the
`` They are all sons of rich men , <<target>> have equipped themselves entirely at their own expense .::::and
They are admirably mounted , and provided they are not caught in an <<target>> , are not likely to see the inside of a Boer prison .::::ambush
It says a good deal for their zeal that they are ready to <<target>> themselves as Boer farmers instead of going in for smart uniforms .::::disguise
As soon as they were fairly south <<target>> the town , Chris said :::::of
`` Now our <<target>> begins .::::work
Number one squad will make its way towards the river , and follow its course , keeping always at a distance from it , so that while they <<target>> would escape notice , they can ascertain whether any bodies of the enemy are this side of it , or within sight beyond the other bank .::::themselves
Number four will take the right flank , <<target>> keep a sharp look-out in that direction .::::and
Squads two and three will , under my command , scout between <<target>> flanking parties , and examine the farmhouses and the country generally .::::the
The whole will , as I said last night , maintain a distance of about three hundred yards apart , <<target>> each man will as far as possible keep those next to him on either hand in sight . ''::::and
The two flanking companies starting off , those under Chris separating as they rode off <<target>> they were as far apart as he had ordered , and then moved forward .::::until
When on level ground they went fast , but broke into a walk whenever they came to the <<target>> of rising ground , and when near the top halted , dismounted , and crawled forward .::::foot
Each man carried a Union Jack about the size of a <<target>> , elastic rings being sewn to two of the corners .::::handkerchief
When necessary these flags could be slipped over the rifles , and a signal could be passed from one to another <<target>> the whole line -- to halt by waving the flag , to advance by holding the rifles steadily erect .::::along
Other signals were to be <<target>> in the future .::::invented
Chris took his place in the centre of the line , in readiness <<target>> ride to either flank from which a signal might be given .::::to
For five or six miles no signs <<target>> the enemy could be perceived .::::of
Most of the fields were entirely deserted , but round a few of the scattered farmhouses animals could be seen grazing , and these Chris set down <<target>> belonging to Dutch farmers who had no fear of interference by the Boers , and were prepared to join them as soon as they advanced .::::as
Many of these , indeed , during the past fortnight had trekked <<target>> , and were already in the ranks of the enemy .::::north
Presently Chris , who was constantly using his glasses , saw the flutter of a flag on a <<target>> away to the left , and a minute later the signal to halt passed along the line .::::hill
It had been agreed that signalling by shot should not be attempted unless the <<target>> seen were so far distant that they would not be likely to hear .::::enemy
`` What do you <<target>> , Brown ? ''::::see
Chris said as he reached the <<target>> who had first signalled .::::lad
`` There are a good many men and <<target>> round a farmhouse about two miles away .::::animals
The house lies under the shoulder of a hill to the left , <<target>> suppose that that is why the others did not see it . ''::::i
Dismounting , Chris crawled forward with the other until <<target>> could obtain a view across the country .::::he
As Brown had said , the farmhouse stood at the foot of the line of hills they were crossing , and was fully a mile <<target>> to those on the right flank than to the point from which he was looking at it , but hidden from their view .::::nearer
Bringing his glass to bear upon it , he could distinctly make out that some forty or fifty <<target>> were moving about , and that a large quantity of cattle were collected near the house .::::men
`` They are too strong for us to attack <<target>> , at least if they are all Boers .::::openly
It would not do to lose half <<target>> number in our first fight .::::our
Still , we may be able to frighten them off , and <<target>> the farmer , who is certainly a loyalist , and cattle .::::save
You gallop along the line as far as it extends <<target>> order all to come over to the right .::::and
I shall go on at once and get <<target>> view of the ground close by .::::a
By the time they have all assembled we <<target>> see what had best be done . ''::::can
Going back to their horses <<target>> started in opposite directions .::::they
In a few minutes Chris reached a point which he believed to be nearly <<target>> the farmhouse , picking up some of the scouts by the way .::::behind
`` I expect I shall be back in about a quarter <<target>> a hour , '' he said as he dismounted .::::of
`` You , Peters and Field , may as well come <<target>> me , I may want to send back orders . ''::::with
They walked forward fast until so far down the hill <<target>> they could obtain a view of the farmhouse .::::that
The moment they did so they lay down , and made their way across some broken ground until they were within a quarter of a mile of it ; then <<target>> among some rocks they had a look through their glasses , and could see everything that was passing as clearly as if they had been standing in the farmyard .::::seated
It was evident the Boers had only arrived <<target>> a short time before Brown noticed them .::::there
Parties of two or three were still driving in cattle , others were going in and out of the house , <<target>> returning with such articles as they fancied and putting them down by their horses in readiness to carry them off .::::some
Two men and some women and children were standing together in a <<target>> ; these were beyond doubt the owners of the farmhouse .::::group
`` How many Boers <<target>> you make out ?::::do
Peters had made out forty , and Field forty-three , the difference being <<target>> for by those going in and out of the house and sheds .::::accounted
`` Well , we will say forty-five , <<target>> then we sha n't be far wrong .::::and
We certainly ca n't attack that number openly , but we may <<target>> them off empty-handed if we take them by surprise . ''::::drive
He examined the ground for another minute or two , and then said : `` I think <<target>> might make our way down among these rocks to within three hundred yards of the house .::::we
I will send six <<target>> down to you .::::more
With the others I will go down farther to the left , and work along in <<target>> little donga running into the flat a hundred yards to the east of the house .::::that
You keep a sharp look-out in that direction , and you will be <<target>> to see us , while we shall be hidden from the Boers .::::able
We shall halt about three <<target>> yards beyond the house .::::hundred
As soon as we are ready I will wave a <<target>> , then you and your party will open fire .::::flag
Directly they do so we will open fire on them , and finding <<target>> taken in the flank they are likely to bolt without hesitation .::::themselves
Do n't throw away a shot if you can help it , but <<target>> your magazines as fast as you can be sure of your aim .::::empty
Between us we ought to account for <<target>> good many of them . ''::::a
`` We can bring our horses down a good <<target>> farther without being seen , '' he said .::::bit
`` There is a dip farther <<target>> with some rough brushwood .::::on
Leading their own horses and those of Field and Peters they walked down to the spot Chris had chosen , and there <<target>> the reins over the horses ' heads as usual , unfastened the head ropes , and tied them to the bushes .::::threw
Chris had already explained the situation to the troop , and had <<target>> off six of them to go down to join Peters .::::told
He now advanced cautiously with these till he could point out <<target>> them exactly the spot where the two scouts were lying .::::to
Then he returned to the others , and they walked along fast until they came upon the break in <<target>> hill , which lower down developed into a depression , and was during the rains a water-course .::::the
Down this they <<target>> their way .::::made
On reaching the bottom they found it was some <<target>> feet below the level of the surrounding ground .::::twelve
A couple of hundred yards further they could tell by the sound of shouting , the bellowing of cattle , <<target>> other noises , that they were abreast of the farmhouse , and going another three hundred yards they halted .::::and
Chris went up the bank until he could obtain a view , and <<target>> that he was just at the spot he had fixed on .::::saw
Making signs to the others , they took their places <<target>> he had directed , some ten yards apart .::::as
Then he raised his rifle after <<target>> the little flag upon it .::::slipping
Chris , with his eyes just above the level of the <<target>> , could see all that was passing round the farmhouse .::::ground
With shouts of alarm the Boers at once rushed towards <<target>> horses , several dropping before they reached them .::::their
As they rode out from the yard the magazine rifles kept up a constant <<target>> , sounding as if a strong company of troops were at work .::::rattle
Chris waited until they were nearly abreast <<target>> his party , and then fired .::::of
His companions followed his example , and in a moment a fire as <<target>> and effective as that still kept up from the hill was maintained .::::rapid
This completed the stampede <<target>> the enemy .::::of
They were soon half a mile away , but even at that distance the Mauser bullets continued <<target>> whistle over and among them , and they continued their flight until lost in the distance .::::to
Chris 's whistle gave the signal for ceasing fire , and the two parties sprang <<target>> their feet , gave three hearty cheers , and then ran towards the farmhouse .::::to
In the yard lay five Boers and seven or eight horses ; the riders had jumped up behind <<target>> , for as they passed , Chris had seen that several of the animals were carrying double .::::companions
The little group , so lately prisoners , advanced as they came up , almost bewildered at the sudden transformation that had taken place , their surprise being increased on <<target>> that they had apparently been rescued by another party of Boers , and still more when on their reaching them they found that these were all mere lads .::::seeing
`` We are a party of Maritzburg Scouts , '' Chris said , with a smile at their astonished faces ; `` though , <<target>> you see , we are got up as Boers so as to be able to get close to them without exciting suspicion .::::as
We were fortunate in just <<target>> in time . ''::::arriving
`` We thank you indeed , sir , '' the settler said , `` for you have saved us the <<target>> of all our property , and , for aught I know , from being carried off as prisoners .::::loss
We were intending to trek down to Ladysmith today , and <<target>> just driven in our herds when the Boers arrived .::::had
We are indeed grateful <<target>> you . ''::::to
`` We are very glad to have had the chance <<target>> giving the plunderers a lesson , '' Chris said .::::of
`` It will make them <<target>> little cautious in future .::::a
But I think that you are wise to go at once , for there are certainly parties between this and Elandslaagte , where <<target>> have cut the line ; so I should advise you to travel west for a bit before you strike down to Ladysmith .::::they
We have not heard of any of them <<target>> beyond the line of railway yet .::::being
Now we have <<target>> to do .::::work
Number one and two squads will at once go up and fetch down the horses , number three and four will examine <<target>> Boers who have fallen here and out on the plain and will bring in any who may be only wounded . ''::::the
He went out with this party ; <<target>> found that eight more had fallen .::::they
Three of these lay at a short distance from the farmhouse , and had evidently fallen under the <<target>> of the party on the hill ; the others had been hit by those in the ambuscade .::::fire
Altogether ten horses <<target>> been killed .::::had
Five of the Boers <<target>> still alive .::::were
`` Have you a <<target>> cart ? ''::::spare
`` Yes , I <<target>> spare one .::::can
Fortunately I have a small <<target>> besides two large waggons .::::one
May I ask what you <<target>> it for ? ''::::want
`` I want it to carry these wounded <<target>> to within reach of their friends .::::men
Which is the <<target>> drift ? ''::::nearest
It is a little more <<target>> two miles away . ''::::than
`` Then we will place the wounded in the cart , and you might send one of your Kaffirs with it to the drift and stick up a <<target>> with a sheet on it ; they are sure to have halted on the other side , and will guess that there are wounded in it .::::pole
As soon as the Kaffir comes within two or three hundred yards <<target>> the river he can take the horses out and return .::::of
I dare say he will be back <<target>> before you are off . ''::::again
The cart was driven along the line that the Boers had taken , <<target>> wounded being carefully lifted and placed in it as it reached them .::::the
Long before they reached the house <<target>> horses had been brought down .::::the
The settler and his Kaffirs were hard at <<target>> loading the stores into two ox-waggons .::::work
The lads all lent their assistance , and in less than an hour the settlers started for Ladysmith , the women <<target>> children in the wagon , and the men on horseback driving their herds with the aid of the Kaffirs .::::and
After a hearty adieu , Chris and his party rode on together for <<target>> little distance before again scattering widely to recommence their work of scouting .::::some
Hitherto they had been too busy for conversation , but now they were <<target>> to give words to the satisfaction they all felt at their success .::::able
`` It has <<target>> splendid ! ''::::been
`` We have defeated a force twice as strong as ourselves , have killed or badly wounded eighteen of <<target>> , and you may be sure that of those that got away several must have been hit .::::them
Not one of us <<target>> a scratch . ''::::has
`` It could not <<target>> been better managed .::::have
I think we ought to give <<target>> cheers for Chris . ''::::three
Three rousing cheers <<target>> given .::::were
`` After this , Chris , '' Carmichael said , `` I <<target>> n't think you need talk any more about resigning the command .::::do
General Symons himself could not <<target>> done better . ''::::have
`` I think , at any rate , we have <<target>> to wipe off old scores , '' Chris said .::::begun
`` We have paid for a few of the insults the ladies had to submit to as <<target>> came along , and I am heartily glad that we were in time to do it .::::we
We have baulked them of the haul they expected to make , and saved something like a thousand <<target>> of cattle for the colony , to say nothing of preventing these people from being absolutely ruined .::::head
It is only a pity that we <<target>> not our horses with us .::::had
If we had , not many of <<target>> Boers would have recrossed the river .::::the
But we could not have taken them with us without being detected before we got into position , and in <<target>> case we might have had a hard fight , and matters would probably have turned out altogether differently . ''::::that
There was a general expression of assent , for all felt that in an equal fight the <<target>> , being twice their own numbers , would have been more than a match for them .::::boers
It was evening when they returned to Dundee , having <<target>> across no more Boers during the day 's work .::::come
Directly they arrived at the little camp where they had left the tents standing in charge of their two Kaffirs , Chris wrote a short report of their doings , stating <<target>> that they had come upon a party of forty-five Boers in the act of driving off the cattle and sacking the house of Mr. Fraser , a loyal settler .::::briefly
Having dismounted and divided into two parties , they had attacked the Boers and driven them <<target>> , with the loss of ten killed and eight seriously wounded left on the field .::::off
Many of their horses <<target>> been killed .::::had
The wounded Boers had been sent in a cart to Vant 's Drift , and the farmer and his herds <<target>> been escorted as far as the line of railway , which they had crossed and were making for Ladysmith .::::had
There had been no <<target>> among his party .::::casualties
Field rode over with this report and delivered it at headquarters , <<target>> to ask whether there were any orders for the next day .::::remaining
When he returned he brought <<target>> line from the general .::::a
The affair must have been managed excellently , <<target>> does you all the greatest credit .::::and
Continue scouting on the <<target>> line to-morrow . ''::::same
The lads were all highly delighted when Chris read this aloud , and then sat down to a well-earned meal , which was the more enjoyed as it had been <<target>> that Field , as one of the finance committee , should go into the town and buy half a dozen of champagne in honour of their first victory .::::voted
In the course of the evening one of the general 's staff rode into camp on his way to <<target>> , having been requested by him to obtain full particulars of the fight at Eraser 's farm .::::town
He took his seat by the fire with them , <<target>> Chris gave him a full account of their proceedings .::::and
`` Upon my word , Mr. King , '' he said , `` you <<target>> the matter admirably ; no cavalry leader could have done it better . ''::::managed
`` There is no particular credit about the management , '' Chris said ; `` we acted just as <<target>> should have done had we been stalking a herd of deer instead of a party of Boers .::::we
One always manages , if possible , to put a party on the line <<target>> which they are likely to take flight , before crawling up within shot .::::by
`` You were quite right not to risk it , '' the officer said ; `` we know by old experience that the Boers are formidable antagonists when behind shelter , and , accustomed <<target>> they are to shooting on horseback , I dare say they will do well when not opposed by regular cavalry , who , I am convinced , would ride through and through them .::::as
I am quite sure that in the open they will not be able to make any stand whatever against infantry , which is <<target>> more important , as in so hilly a country as Natal our cavalry would seldom be able to act with advantage . ''::::the
In the course of conversation he told them that there was <<target>> news of any large body of the Boers being near .::::no
Joubert 's force had not moved out of Newcastle , and nothing had been <<target>> of the Free Staters or of the Utrecht force under Lucas Meyer .::::heard
`` We have sentries on all the lower hills round here and <<target>> , and there is no fear of our being surprised .::::glencoe
The sooner they come the better , for we are all longing to get at them ; <<target>> I can tell you we felt quite jealous when we heard of your spirited affair to-day .::::and
I can assure you that we shall have a greater respect for the volunteers than we had before , and if <<target>> do as well as you have done to-day they will be a most valuable addition to our force . ''::::all
After their visitor had left , they sat chatting round <<target>> fire till ten o'clock , and then turned in .::::a
A deep boom and a strange <<target>> sound was in their ears .::::rushing
With exclamations of surprise they all <<target>> out of their tents .::::scrambled
`` What is <<target>> ? ''::::that
`` It is a big gun on the <<target>> of that high hill they call Talana .::::top
We saw the flash of light , and directly <<target>> heard the report , and a rushing sound .::::after
I suppose it was a shot overhead ; if it had been <<target>> shell we should have heard it burst and seen the flash .::::a
It must have been fired <<target>> the camp . ''::::at
The horses , startled by the report , were plunging and kicking , and <<target>> lads at once ran to their heads and patted and soothed them .::::the
Not until they were quiet <<target>> they gather again .::::did
`` What time <<target>> it ? ''::::is
`` The clock on the church struck two a few minutes <<target>> , '' Brown , who was on sentry , said .::::ago
It was about a mile and a half east of the <<target>> , and therefore some three miles from the camp .::::town
`` It must be a very heavy gun by its sound -- as big <<target>> the largest of those we have heard fired from that fort above Johannesburg .::::as
Joubert must have started from Newcastle early to have managed to get it up there by this time , or it <<target>> be the force from Utrecht ; anyhow , they must be strong to venture to attack us in this way .::::may
We may as well saddle up , though it <<target>> hardly likely the cavalry will be engaged .::::is
I shall not send to camp for orders ; the general will have enough to <<target>> about , and it will make no matter where twenty men place themselves .::::think
However , I shall ride over to camp and see what is going on there ; it <<target>> likely enough that there will be an attack by the Free Staters on the other side .::::is
Carmichael and Horrocks , do you run into the <<target>> and see what is going on there .::::town
I will not start till you get back ; if any of <<target>> staff see me they may ask some questions about it . ''::::the
In a quarter of an <<target>> the two lads returned .::::hour
`` We may be pretty sure that nothing will <<target>> done till daylight , '' Chris said .::::be
`` Our men know the ground now , and none of the Transvaal Boers can do so , <<target>> I do n't think they will venture to move till they can see their way about .::::and
I am glad , indeed , that most of the women and children were sent off two days ago , and that the scare on the evening that we arrived , when the <<target>> came of the railway being cut at Elandslaagte , sent the greater part of the men who had remained behind , and who did not mean fighting , off by road .::::news
You had better give the horses a feed -- that is , if they <<target>> disposed to eat at this hour -- while I am away . ''::::are
On reaching the camp , Chris <<target>> all the troops under arms .::::found
They had been roused before the Boer fire began , as a <<target>> to the east of Dundee had been attacked and driven in .::::picket
It was not , however , supposed that the <<target>> were in force until their guns opened fire .::::boers
All lights were out in the camp , <<target>> the enemy 's shot had gone wide .::::and
It was by no means clear why the Boers should have betrayed their presence on the top <<target>> the hill until it was light enough for them to use their guns with effect .::::of
Chris had , before starting , <<target>> on his flat cap .::::put
As he approached the camp he was challenged by <<target>> sentry : `` Who comes there ? ''::::a
and on his replying , `` An officer of the Maritzburg Scouts , '' the sentry called <<target>> : `` Advance , officer of the Maritz Scouts , and give the countersign . ''::::out
Fortunately , as it happened , the officer had given it to Chris on his visit to their camp , and he therefore answered at <<target>> , `` Ladysmith , '' and was relieved when the sentry called out , `` Ladysmith pass , and all is well . ''::::once
When he entered the camp he found the men were standing in lines , but at ease , with <<target>> rifles piled in front of them , and there was a hum of conversation in the ranks .::::their
At the head-quarter tents <<target>> was astir .::::everybody
Presently an officer <<target>> up .::::came
`` Who are <<target>> ? ''::::you
he asked as <<target>> advanced .::::he
`` I am in command of <<target>> party of Maritzburg Scouts . ''::::the
`` Mr. King , <<target>> it not ? ''::::is
I have ridden in to ask <<target>> there are any orders . ''::::if
`` No , and there will be none issued until it is daylight , and <<target>> can make out how matters stand and what is the force of the Boers .::::we
Then I will ride <<target>> at once . ''::::back
On returning to camp , he said : `` <<target>> is nothing to be done till morning .::::there
So far they have no idea <<target>> the force of the Boers .::::of
This is just the work <<target>> were formed for .::::we
Peters , you and Field and Horrocks certainly <<target>> Dutch better than any of the others .::::speak
It is no use for more than four of us to go , so the others can turn in , except the two sentries ; but <<target>> will , of course , be ready to mount in case any party of Boers should come down upon the town before it is light .::::all
The next time I want three men on special <<target>> I will give others a chance . ''::::duty
Of course it will be more difficult getting up there in the dark ; but I shall make a detour of three or four miles , <<target>> come up on the other side , and we should be much more likely to be questioned if we were on foot than on horseback .::::and
Should we come upon any party of armed Boers , remember we have just arrived from Standerton , and finding when we got to Newcastle <<target>> the force had moved on , and were to take up their station at Talana Hill , we rode on to overtake them .::::that
When we get fairly there among them , we will dismount ; Field and <<target>> will stand by the four horses , Horrocks and I will go on .::::peters
If you hear a row , you will mount and wait a minute or two , and then <<target>> we do not come , you will ride off with our horses as well as your own .::::if
We shall try and make our way to the edge of the hill , and ought to be able <<target>> slip away in the darkness if we can get there before we are shot down or overtaken .::::to
However , I do n't think there <<target>> much chance of our being recognized .::::is
Indeed , I expect most of them will be lying <<target>> for a sleep before the time comes for action .::::down
If there is one thing a Boer hates <<target>> is being kept awake at night .::::it
I will take one of <<target>> Kaffir boys with us .::::the
They can see in the dark a great deal better than we can ; and as the Boers are sure to have some natives with them , he is quite <<target>> likely to pick up news as we are -- more so , perhaps , for the natives will sit and talk all night while their masters are snoring .::::as
I think the one we call <<target>> is the sharpest . ''::::jack
Jack was called up , and on being told what <<target>> required , at once agreed to accompany them .::::was
Chris and his three companions mounted , and with the <<target>> running alongside they set off at a trot .::::kaffir
Keeping to the north of east , they rode on for some two miles , <<target>> leading the way with as much ease as if it had been daylight .::::jack
When they had , as they calculated , come upon the ground the Boers must have passed over , they turned <<target>> , and kept on until they saw the dark mass of Talana on their right , and made towards it .::::south
On this side the hill sloped gradually , while on that <<target>> Dundee it was extremely steep and strewn with boulders .::::facing
They were now going at a walk , and they soon came upon an immense gathering of waggons , <<target>> , oxen and ponies , crowded without any order , just as they had arrived two hours before .::::carts
`` There is no fear of our being detected , '' Chris said in <<target>> whisper , `` and we ca n't do better than stop here .::::a
There is no getting the horses through this crowd , and if we did manage to <<target>> so there would be no getting them back , certainly not in a hurry .::::do
You had better lie down beside them , it is not <<target>> that any Boers will be coming up or down .::::likely
If the whole camp is like this there is <<target>> the slightest fear of our getting caught . ''::::not
Jack had already been instructed that when he got into the camp he was to leave them and join any <<target>> of Kaffirs he found awake , and talk to them as if he were one of the bullock drivers .::::party
As Chris and his companions returned , the former would blow his whistle softly , <<target>> he was then to make his way down to the horses at once .::::and
There were , however , large numbers of ponies <<target>> here in readiness should their masters require them .::::assembled
Here the fighting <<target>> were assembled .::::men
For the most part they were lying down ; some were asleep ; others , however , were <<target>> about , and joining or leaving groups gathered together discussing the events of the next day .::::moving
Horrocks and Chris now separated and joined different <<target>> , some twenty yards from each other .::::parties
They attracted no <<target>> whatever .::::attention
Their appearance in their broad hats and rough clothing , their bandoliers and <<target>> , was precisely similar to that of the men standing about .::::rifles
No doubt whatever that the morning would bring them a <<target>> victory , appeared to be entertained by the enemy .::::brilliant
The artillery would first crush that of the British , <<target>> they would charge down and finish the affair .::::then
`` They say that they have less than <<target>> thousand altogether , '' one said .::::four
We shall stop a day to gather the plunder and send it off in <<target>> waggons , then we shall go south and destroy the force at Ladysmith .::::the
Three days later we shall be in Maritzburg , and within three or <<target>> days afterwards shall drive the British on board their ships at Durban .::::four
We shall get grand plunder <<target>> and at Maritzburg .::::there
But I think it is time now to take a <<target>> at building up that wall along the front .::::hand
Ebers ' commando have been at it for three <<target>> , and it is our turn now . ''::::hours
There was a general movement , which was accelerated by a sharp order , and <<target>> minute later Horrocks and Chris again came together and moved on with the others .::::a
Three hundred yards farther they came upon six guns , beyond which a number of <<target>> were at work carrying and placing great stones to form a rough wall .::::men
These left off their work as <<target>> as the party arrived .::::soon
Having now seen all that was necessary , the two <<target>> joined them and returned with them down the hill .::::lads
Through the huge gathering of waggons they made their way <<target>> great difficulty , Chris giving a low whistle occasionally .::::with
At last they were <<target>> the camp .::::through
Jack was standing by the horses , and Peters <<target>> Field at once rose to their feet .::::and
Without a word they mounted , and rode without speaking <<target>> they were some little distance from the waggons .::::till
`` You are back earlier than <<target>> expected , '' Field said .::::i
`` You have been gone <<target>> an hour . ''::::scarcely
`` No ; the only difficulty we had was making our way through the mass of waggons and animals all <<target>> up higgledy-piggledy , and there has been no more excitement than if we had been walking through Dundee .::::mixed
We have got all <<target>> wanted to know .::::we
Their strength is <<target>> four thousand .::::about
They are building a stone wall along the brow of the hill , and <<target>> are cock-sure that they are going to thrash us without difficulty . ''::::they
`` They are fools to count their chickens before <<target>> are hatched , '' the latter said .::::they
`` If they think it is going to be another Laing 's Nek business they will find themselves mightily mistaken , though it will <<target>> a very difficult business to scale that hill from the other side under such a rifle fire as they will keep up . ''::::be
In half an hour <<target>> reached their camp .::::they
`` Not much <<target>> , baas .::::news
Talk with some Kaffirs ; all hope that we beat <<target>> to-day , but think we can not do so .::::them
Too many Boers <<target>> big guns .::::and
They say Boers very angry because the other commandos <<target>> here , and Free State Boers not arrived .::::not
They sure going to beat the rooineks , <<target>> are afraid that some may get away .::::but
If Joubert and Free Staters here , catch them <<target>> a trap and kill them all . ''::::in
By this time the rest of the party <<target>> turned out to hear the news .::::had
They had had but little sleep , for all were intensely anxious as to the fate of their four comrades , and although <<target>> that they had returned safely , were a little disappointed on finding that the affair had been so tame and unexciting .::::delighted
While they were talking the two Kaffirs had stirred up the fire , <<target>> some wood and some coal on , and hung up the kettle .::::put
`` That is right , Jack , '' Chris said ; `` day will begin <<target>> break in half an hour , and we may have to be moving . ''::::to
All was quiet until half-past five , and the lads had just finished their meal when the <<target>> guns opened fire , and two or three minutes later those of the British replied .::::boer
`` It is an uncomfortable feeling sitting here with <<target>> terrific roaring noise overhead , '' Chris said .::::that
`` One knows that there is not the slightest risk of being hit , <<target>> , to say the least of it , it is very unpleasant .::::but
There , a shell has <<target>> burst over the camp .::::just
So it is shell that <<target>> are firing . ''::::they
Indeed , the Boers had been using these missiles only , but owing to some fault in the <<target>> , or the badness of the fuses , they fell for the most part without bursting .::::loading
It was soon evident to the lads that the range of the <<target>> guns was shorter than that of the heavier pieces from Talana .::::british
The distance was five thousand yards , and the elevated position of <<target>> Boer guns added to the advantage given by their superior weight .::::the
Sir Penn Symons was standing on <<target>> small elevation watching the fire .::::a
Chris rode up <<target>> saluted .::::and
`` I have no orders for you , Mr. King , except that <<target>> the fighting is over you will join the cavalry in pursuit . ''::::when
`` Thank you , sir ; I have not come for orders , but to report to you that with Mr. Horrocks and two <<target>> , and one of our Kaffir servants , I entered the Boer camp last night in order to ascertain their strength . ''::::others
the general exclaimed <<target>> surprise .::::in
he said , turning round to three or four of <<target>> staff standing but a short distance behind him .::::his
`` Mr. King and three of his party absolutely entered <<target>> Boer camp last night to discover their force .::::the
Well , sir , what <<target>> the result ? ''::::was
`` There are about four thousand of them , sir , over rather <<target>> under , and they have six guns , all of heavy calibre .::::than
When I was there they were at work building a thick wall some <<target>> feet high of rough stones along the edge of the hill .::::five
It will scarcely shelter the guns , but it will provide <<target>> for the riflemen at the edge of the hill .::::cover
There is an immense gathering of waggons and carts -- there are certainly not <<target>> than a thousand of them -- in a confused mass behind the hill .::::less
Arriving in the dark , each seems to have <<target>> on until it could get no farther .::::gone
They certainly could not ride away till the waggons have been passed through , but possibly a passage may have been left on each side of <<target>> for them to get through , in order , as is their intention , to charge your army when their guns have silenced your artillery .::::these
I gathered that expected commandos <<target>> not come up .::::had
They were disappointed at hearing nothing of the Free Staters , <<target>> they expected would have attacked Glencoe from the other side .::::who
They are absolutely confident of success , and expect to overwhelm General White at Ladysmith in three days from now , and to be <<target>> Pietermaritzburg in a week , and are talking of driving the last rooinek on board the ships at Durban shortly after . ''::::in
`` I am much obliged to you for your information , Mr. King , and am much <<target>> at the courage with which you and your companions entered the Boer camp to obtain it .::::pleased
It is satisfactory to learn that their force <<target>> not much greater than our own .::::is
It is also useful to know that their ponies are gathered so close to them , for shells that go over the hill may burst among <<target>> ; and I believe that one of the Boers ' most vulnerable points is their horses , for without them they would feel absolutely lost .::::them
I am sure , Mr. King , that you would wish to be in the thick of the fighting , but I would rather that you curbed your impetuosity , for after the <<target>> in which you obtained this news for me , I can see that your party will do far greater service in scouting and in gaining intelligence than they could afford in action .::::manner
I should advise you to shift your camp , as the troops are about to advance <<target>> the town , and the enemy 's shot will soon be falling there . ''::::into
A few minutes later two field batteries moved forward and took up their <<target>> south of Dundee , escorted by the mounted infantry and the rifles .::::position
The third battalion of the Lancashire regiment remained to protect the camp should it be attacked by the Free Staters , while the Dublin <<target>> and the Royal Irish Fusiliers were to march through the town to a donga or river-bed half a mile to the east .::::fusiliers
Beyond this the long <<target>> to Talana begins .::::ascent
The King 's Royal Rifles were to take up a <<target>> under cover to the east of the town .::::position
Chris had ridden back <<target>> to Dundee .::::fast
The work of taking down the tents and packing their materials and all the stores on to the spare horses took but a few minutes , and two of the <<target>> went with the two natives and saw the horses safely placed in a sharp depression half a mile away , in which they would be safe from Boer shells .::::lads
Chris had told his companions <<target>> the general had said .::::what
`` We shall have plenty of opportunities afterwards , and it is a compliment that he considers we had better <<target>> ourselves for scouting , which , after all , is the work we always intended to carry out .::::reserve
Still , though , after what he has said , we can not absolutely join the cavalry , <<target>> will manage somehow to see some of the fighting without getting into the thick of it .::::we
Besides , I should say that in any case the whole <<target>> of the affair must fall upon the infantry and artillery .::::brunt
If they silence the Boer guns and capture the hill , the battle is won , and the cavalry will have <<target>> wait for their chance till they can get the Boers to fight on ground where they can act . ''::::to
Drizzling rain had now set in , but this and the fact that they had started without breakfast in no way abated the spirits of <<target>> troops who soon came along , marching with light step and eager faces which showed that they were delighted at the prospect of action .::::the
The batteries to the right had already come into play , and a vigorous cannonade was being directed at the <<target>> of the hill , from which the Boer guns kept up a slower though steady fire in return .::::crest
`` While nothing else is doing we may just as well ride over <<target>> see how things are getting on there , '' Chris said .::::and
And as soon as the two Irish regiments had passed , the little troop trotted <<target>> to the rising ground and dismounted a few hundred yards from the guns .::::across
They soon saw with satisfaction that the fire of the Boers was far from effective , their aim was not good , and a very small proportion <<target>> the shells burst ; while on the other hand the shrapnel from the British batteries burst with splendid accuracy over the crest of the hill .::::of
For two hours the artillery duel continued , <<target>> the Boer guns gradually ceased their fire .::::then
The mist that had partly shrouded the summit of Talana , eight hundred feet above the plain , and the smoke that still hung thickly there , rendered <<target>> impossible to say whether they had all been put out of action or simply withdrawn , but when it cleared off they could no longer be seen .::::it
It was now the <<target>> of the infantry .::::turn
Beyond the donga in which they were lying the rise of the ground <<target>> gradual , up to a plantation which surrounded Smith 's farm .::::was
Beyond this the <<target>> was rocky .::::ground
The men advanced at the double in open order , and the moment <<target>> were seen by the Boers a continuous fire of musketry was opened .::::they
The distance was about a mile , but the Mauser rifles had a <<target>> greater range than this and the bullets pattered thickly on the ground .::::much
Only four men , <<target>> , fell .::::however
The two regiments halted in the plantation and farm buildings , and the advanced line at <<target>> edge of the trees opened fire in answer to that to which they were exposed .::::the
The general at first had taken up his position with the guns , but as soon as <<target>> men advanced from the donga he joined them and accompanied them as far as the plantation .::::the
Then he returned to the battery , which continued its fire with greater <<target>> to prepare the way for the further advance of the infantry .::::activity
The Rifles had joined the two Irish regiments , and at half-past nine General <<target>> galloped up to the farm and gave the order for the advance .::::symons
This was received with a cheer by the <<target>> , who had been impatiently awaiting it .::::men
Scarcely had the cheer died away when the general was mortally <<target>> by a bullet that struck him in the stomach .::::wounded
Unconscious that the wound was so severe he retained his seat a minute or <<target>> , and was then carried by the Indian bearer company into the town .::::two
The troops , ignorant of the misfortune that had befallen them , were now working their way up the hill , taking advantage of every stone and <<target>> , and although exposed to a terrific fire , gradually pushing on until they reached a stone wall which ran round the face of the hill .::::boulder
Beyond this the ground was much rougher and very much steeper -- so <<target>> , indeed , that it was almost impossible to climb it .::::steep
The fire of the <<target>> was now terrific .::::enemy
The troops were some three hundred yards from the crest , and <<target>> was certain death to show a head above the wall .::::it
An officer placed his helmet on the end of his sword , and <<target>> moment he raised it , it was riddled by five balls .::::the
For a time it was impossible to advance farther , but when the Boer fire moderated <<target>> little the order ran along the line for the men to storm the position .::::a
A signal was made to the artillery to cease fire , and as <<target>> did so the men leapt over the wall and rushed forward .::::it
There was now no thought of taking shelter or returning the Boers ' <<target>> , every effort was needed for surmounting the difficulties in their way .::::fire
In some places the rock was so steep that the men had to climb on their hands and <<target>> , sometimes those below pushed their comrades up and were in turn assisted by them to climb .::::knees
The roar of <<target>> was unceasing .::::musketry
It seemed to be an impossibility for any man to reach the <<target>> unscathed , and yet there was no hesitation or wavering .::::top
Numbers fell , but panting and <<target>> the rest pressed on .::::determined
The Rifles suffered most heavily , and out of the seventeen <<target>> who advanced with them five were killed and seven wounded .::::officers
At last the steepest part <<target>> the ascent was surmounted .::::of
Those who first reached this point waited until joined by others , and then fixing <<target>> they rushed up the slope to the edge of the plateau cheering loudly .::::bayonets
They had believed it impossible for mortal men to scale the hill under their continuous fire , <<target>> our steady advance through the hail of bullets had astounded them and shaken their courage .::::and
The artillery , after ceasing fire , had galloped off at full speed and taken up their <<target>> on the ridge known as Smith 's Nek , overlooking the plain behind the hill .::::position
For a distance of three miles this <<target>> covered with waggons and galloping men .::::was
It was , however , but the first of numerous similar acts of <<target>> , and the Boers were thus enabled to make their escape .::::treachery
The appearance of the plateau gained <<target>> the troops was appalling .::::by
Some five hundred of the Boers lay dead or <<target>> , and many had doubtless been carried off .::::wounded
Three of the guns lay dismounted , the others had been removed ; for as they could not be sufficiently <<target>> to bear upon the stormers , they had been taken off as soon as the advance began in earnest .::::depressed
Beyond the plateau smashed waggons <<target>> dead animals lay thickly .::::and
Great numbers of the Boer ponies had been killed ; many were <<target>> standing quietly waiting for their masters , lying dead above .::::still
Pursuit was out <<target>> the question .::::of
The men were exhausted by their efforts ; they were wet to the skin by the rain that had for nine hours come down <<target>> ; they had had no food since the previous day , and the tremendous climb had taxed their powers to the utmost .::::unceasingly
For a time they cheered vociferously , the first joy of victory overcoming the thought <<target>> their dead and wounded comrades , who had to be collected and carried down .::::of
The loss had been severe , ten officers and thirty men had been killed , twenty officers and a hundred <<target>> sixty-five men wounded ; and nine officers and two hundred and eleven men did not answer to the roll-call .::::and
Chris , as soon as the infantry advance began , had , after talking with the others , agreed to set out in the direction in which <<target>> three squadrons of cavalry had started in the morning with instructions to work round , and be prepared to cut off the enemy 's retreat .::::the
They had with them some of <<target>> mounted infantry and a machine-gun .::::the
As the whole Boer force would be concentrated on the hill , Chris thought that there would be no danger in riding round , especially as , even <<target>> the Boers posted a force to protect their line of retreat , he was confident that the speed of his horses would prevent any chance of capture .::::had
From some natives he learned the direction that the cavalry had taken , and presently <<target>> rising ground , saw two parties halted in hollows some two miles apart .::::on
The farthest out on the plain appeared to be <<target>> largest , and to this he rode .::::the
The officer in command had seen him in camp , <<target>> as he saluted on riding up , said :::::and
`` So you have come to <<target>> us a hand , sir ?::::lend
Can you tell me how matters <<target>> going on at Dundee ? ''::::are
`` At the time we rode off , sir , the advance of the infantry had just begun , the Boer guns had been silenced , and our men <<target>> advancing from Smith 's farm under a very heavy fire of the enemy , which continued without intermission as long as we were within hearing distance . ''::::were
`` Did you see the other <<target>> as you came along ? ''::::squadron
`` They are in a <<target>> two miles away . ''::::hollow
that is where we <<target>> them . ''::::left
The troopers were all dismounted , <<target>> the scouts followed the example .::::and
The boom of the British <<target>> was continuing unabated .::::guns
`` They can be getting on but <<target>> , '' the officer said .::::slowly
`` I am afraid we shall <<target>> it a very tough job .::::find
I suppose there is a <<target>> force up there ? ''::::strong
`` Over four <<target>> . ''::::thousand
`` How do <<target>> know ? ''::::you
`` I was up there last night , '' <<target>> said , `` with three of the others .::::chris
We did not go up in these caps , <<target>> you may suppose , but in wide-brimmed hats .::::as
We were able to get about <<target>> exciting any suspicion whatever .::::without
We found they had six guns <<target>> over four thousand men .::::and
As we all speak Dutch fluently there was <<target>> no chance of our being detected . ''::::really
The other officers of the <<target>> had all gathered round .::::squadron
`` Danger or no danger , it was a <<target>> plucky action , '' their leader said .::::very
`` I suppose that was the news you <<target>> in just before the troops marched off .::::brought
Well , I wish that we had got our <<target>> and the horses a feed before we started .::::breakfast
`` We have some food <<target>> our haversacks , sir .::::in
We breakfasted before we started , and we filled our haversacks with biscuits , thinking that perhaps they would <<target>> welcome , for we knew that none of the troops had anything to eat before leaving . ''::::be
`` You are very good to offer <<target>> , '' the colonel said .::::it
`` But we could not eat <<target>> the men have nothing . ''::::while
`` It will go round , sir , though <<target>> will be but a small portion for each .::::it
We each put about ten pounds of biscuits in our haversacks , <<target>> shall not be sorry to get rid of the weight .::::and
It will make something like three-quarters of <<target>> pound per man all round . ''::::a
`` I am indeed greatly <<target>> to you . ''::::obliged
The haversacks were emptied and divided into four heaps of equal <<target>> , with a proportionate heap for the ten officers .::::size
Four men were called up from each troop , and in a short time the <<target>> were all munching biscuits , every man dividing his rations with his horse .::::soldiers
The sight of the rough-looking troop had at first excited some amusement and a little derision among the soldiers , but this <<target>> was now exchanged for gratitude , and it was unanimously agreed that these young farmers were a capital set of fellows .::::feeling
`` Our men must be gaining ground , '' the colonel <<target>> , `` and the Boers are beginning to funk . ''::::said
The bits were put into the horses ' mouths again , the saddles buckled up tightly , and <<target>> expression of satisfaction succeeded that of disgust at the long hours standing in the pouring rain .::::an
Presently , when the leading waggons were abreast of them , at a distance of about a mile , the <<target>> was given to mount , and the two squadrons dashed across the plain and were soon among the fugitives .::::order
There were many mounted men among them , these <<target>> the first to steal away from the fight .::::being
They opened fire as the cavalry approached , but <<target>> soon overthrown or driven away in headlong flight .::::were
Many of the waggons were seized , <<target>> each moment their defenders became stronger .::::but
The Boers were now flocking down in great numbers , and seeing their teams and property in danger they dismounted , <<target>> some of the waggons up in a square , and from them opened a heavy fire upon the troopers .::::formed
Chris dismounted his party , and returned the fire , but the officer in command , seeing that with so small <<target>> force of infantry he could do nothing , and that the numbers of their enemies were increasing , drew off .::::a
He would have continued the fight , but he supposed that the artillery would soon be at work , and knew they could not open fire as <<target>> as he was engaging the Boers , he therefore retired with the long train of captured waggons , and late in the afternoon reached camp .::::long
Nothing was seen of the other squadron and mounted infantry , nor was any news received of <<target>> until the following day , when a medical officer with some wounded men came in .::::them
Like the larger force , they too had ridden in among the waggons , but had taken <<target>> more northerly line , and had come on a point where the Boers were thickest .::::a
They had charged and taken several prisoners , <<target>> inflicted severe loss on the enemy .::::and
These , however , had swarmed round them , <<target>> up an incessant fire and barring their retreat .::::keeping
They took up a defensive position in a farm , and for three hours repelled all the attacks of the Boers , until their horses were all <<target>> or had broken away and the ammunition exhausted , while the Boers had just brought up the three guns they had withdrawn from the hill .::::killed
Further resistance would have ended in the extermination of the whole <<target>> , and Lieutenant-Colonel MÃ¶ller was therefore obliged to surrender .::::party
The scouts erected their tents <<target>> on their former ground .::::again
The remaining inhabitants of Dundee were jubilant over the victory that had been won , and <<target>> their best , by hanging out flags from the windows , to decorate the town .::::did
Jack and his companion had returned to the camp with the spare horses as soon as the <<target>> was carried , and had the fires lighted by the time the party came in .::::hill
In spite of having worn their blankets as cloaks , all were wet through , but after changing their clothes , they went into <<target>> town to gather the news of how the hill had been won , and by the time they returned their meal was ready .::::the
`` What do you think <<target>> affairs , Chris ? ''::::of
`` I think that the officer at Ladysmith was right , and that it was <<target>> frightful mistake to divide the force and send four thousand men up here .::::a
They have thrashed the Boers today , but they may <<target>> back again on the top of that hill tomorrow .::::be
`` Why not start to-morrow <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::morning
`` We shall be of no use scouting here , <<target>> not much use if there is hard fighting .::::and
I hear that some natives have brought in the <<target>> that there was some firing to-day at Elandslaagte .::::news
If that is the case , we must have troops there , <<target>> the chances are that they will be there to-morrow . ''::::and
`` Yes , that is very <<target>> , '' Chris agreed .::::likely
`` General White will be sure to hold the line there if he can , for he must <<target>> sure that the force here will have to retreat now that it is attacked in earnest .::::feel
When we were talking to-day to the cavalry , one of the officers mentioned that we had still telegraphic communication <<target>> Ladysmith , for although the wires by the railway are cut , it is possible to communicate through Helpmakaar .::::with
The Boers seem to have forgotten that , for it is quite <<target>> of the direct line , and nearly double as far round .::::out
Well , as we had no orders to come here , I <<target>> there is no occasion to get orders to go back .::::suppose
I think Peters 's proposal is a very good one , but <<target>> a point like this everyone ought to give an opinion .::::on
I think that it would be a fair <<target>> to put it to the vote . ''::::thing
`` Now , '' he said , `` write 'Yes ' if you are <<target>> favour of going back , 'No ' if you are for stopping here .::::in

When the strips of paper were examined , it was found that <<target>> two out of the twenty-one were in favour of remaining .::::only

It is well that we should get there as early as possible , so we will settle to start at <<target>> o'clock , which will take us there by eight , in time to see anything that is going on .::::five
No doubt we shall be able to hear from natives as we go along whether the troops are still there ; at any rate if <<target>> are , we are sure to hear firing before we get there , unless , of course , the Boers have retired . ''::::they
The horses had already had an extra feed , and the Kaffirs <<target>> warned of the hour at which they were going to start .::::were
The pack-horses were able to keep up with the rest , for their loads were <<target>> no means heavy -- in fact , they carried less weight than the others .::::by
The two hundred pounds of biscuits given to the hussars made no difference in their baggage , for this had been bought at Dundee , as the lads decided to <<target>> their stores as far as possible intact for a time when they might for some days be away scouting in a district where no provisions could be obtained .::::keep
At four o'clock the sentries roused the others , and having taken a cup of coffee and some cold meat and bread , and led the horses down to the stream while the Kaffirs were loading up the packets and bundles , they <<target>> at five o'clock and set off at a trot , Jack and Japhet , a name suggested by Field , who was the wag of the party , were allowed to ride on two of the horses that carried the lightest burdens .::::mounted
All the lads were provided with compasses , but these were not necessary , as <<target>> the natives were well acquainted with the country , which was wild and mountainous .::::both
When they reached Wessels station , nine miles from <<target>> , they heard the sound of guns .::::elandslaagte
At this proof that there was still a force there , they turned off from the road , and riding west , struck the point where the main <<target>> to Meran crossed the Sundays River , and then , still keeping a mile west of the line of railway , found themselves abreast of the station .::::road
Just as they did so , a body <<target>> mounted volunteers galloped up towards them .::::of
As soon as they were seen , they exchanged their hats for forage-caps , and <<target>> of them , by Chris 's orders , hoisted their union-jacks on their rifles .::::some

`` I am afraid <<target>> , sir .::::so
There is nothing to prevent the Boers from returning to their position on Talana Hill to-day ; and soon after we left the <<target>> this morning we heard the sound of guns away on the right , and supposed that the Free Staters had approached Glencoe .::::town

For the time , however , <<target>> wish was not gratified .::::this
The Boers now seeing that they had such a small force opposed to them , steadied themselves and opened fire with some guns , Maxims , <<target>> rifles from the crest of the hill , while a swarm of horsemen and dismounted men poured out to threaten the flanks of the British .::::and
The odds were too great ; the comparatively heavy guns of the enemy were well aimed and <<target>> , and quite overpowered the fire of the light cannon of the field and mountain batteries .::::served
The order was given to fall back , which was done in good order , though <<target>> troops were harassed by a hot fire from the enemy concealed in the gullies .::::the
On reaching the high ground near Modder Spruit , the country was more <<target>> favour of the British , who were now extended on each flank .::::in
The Boers were unable or unwilling to move their heavy guns from their position on the hill , and being now beyond <<target>> range , and exposed to the fire of four batteries as well as the infantry , those pressing forward fell back .::::their
General French had brought out a signalling apparatus with him , and the telegraph wires were tapped , <<target>> a message sent to General White asking him for reinforcements in order to carry the Boer position .::::and

It was still too distant , however , to do any serious execution , and the <<target>> moved forward as regularly and unconcernedly as if it had been a field day .::::british

The darkness was all in favour of the advancing infantry , <<target>> in their khaki uniforms were almost invisible to the Boers .::::who
The troops were now in extended open order , and advanced towards the foot of the hill by rushes , taking advantage of the ant-hills that studded the plain <<target>> afforded an excellent cover , being high enough to cover them while lying down , and thick and compact enough to resist the passage of a Mauser bullet .::::and
The Highlanders were suffering the most heavily , their dark kilts showing up strongly against the light sandy <<target>> , and while the Devons and Manchesters sustained but few casualties , they were dropping fast .::::soil
The storm was now at its height , the thunder for a time deadening the roar of the battle , <<target>> through the driving rain the infantry pressed on until they reached the foot of the Boers ' hill .::::but
Large numbers of the enemy were on the slope , hidden from sight by the boulders , but <<target>> could not long maintain their position , for the British marksmen shot as straight as the Boer .::::these
Our batteries , which had almost silenced those of the enemy , scattered their shrapnel among those higher up the hill , and <<target>> the Boers rose to fly before the bayonets of our cheering troops , they were swept away by volleys of the Lee-Metfords .::::as

Hitherto the British loss had been wonderfully small considering the storm of bullets through which they had passed , <<target>> numbers now dropped , and taken wholly by surprise , the troops ran up the hill again .::::but

The lads ' flasks were of great use now , and enabled many a man , <<target>> badly wounded to be carried down the rough hillside , to hold on till morning .::::too
On the following morning orders came for General French to retire , as strong parties of the enemy had been seen further south , and it was hourly becoming <<target>> and more evident that it would be impossible to hold the country beyond Ladysmith , and many were of opinion that even this position was too far advanced .::::more

`` We have had one lesson , '' Chris said , as at seven in the morning the party assembled , worn out by the long night 's work , `` <<target>> that is , that blankets are well enough against a passing shower , but that when there is any probability of wet we must carry our waterproof sheets with us .::::and

In another twenty minutes they were <<target>> hot coffee and munching biscuits .::::drinking
At ten o'clock the bugle sounded the assembly , and the troops formed up , the wounded <<target>> placed in ambulance waggons or carried on stretchers , and all returned to Elandslaagte station .::::were
Here the wounded were sent on by train , <<target>> the infantry and cavalry returned by road .::::while
Talking to some of the officers of the Imperial Horse , several of whom were friends of his father , and had only left Johannesburg a short time before the declaration of war , Chris learned that the principal object in fighting the battle was to drive the Boers <<target>> the line by which the Dundee force would retreat ; for Colonel Yule in his telegraphic despatch had stated , that although a victory had been won he felt that the position was untenable , and that he might at any moment be forced to evacuate it .::::off
He also learned that the safety of the line beyond Ladysmith was already threatened , but whether <<target>> George White would decide upon falling back towards Pietermaritzburg or would hold Ladysmith no one knew .::::sir
Certainly nothing could be determined upon until General <<target>> rejoined with the division from Dundee .::::yule
The position there was indeed <<target>> worse every hour .::::growing
While the battle of Elandslaagte was being fought the Boers had opened fire from the hills <<target>> Glencoe on the British camp , and had compelled it to shift its position .::::above
A cavalry reconnaissance which was sent out found that the Boers were in great strength in the <<target>> of Glencoe , and it was therefore determined to move by the roundabout way through Helpmakaar .::::pass
Some stores of ammunition that had been left under a guard in the other camp were fetched , and with full <<target>> the little army started on its long and perilous march at nine o'clock on the evening of the 22nd .::::pouches
The camp was abandoned <<target>> it stood .::::as
The wounded remained with some surgeons under <<target>> protection of the Red Cross flag .::::the
All the available transport accompanied the column , but the <<target>> 's kits and all other encumbrances were left behind .::::men
They were obliged to pass through Dundee to get upon the southern road , but so <<target>> was the movement effected that but few of the townsmen knew what was happening .::::quietly
The column was led by Colonel Dartnel , chief of the Natal <<target>> , whose knowledge of the district was invaluable to the troops .::::police
The roads were heavy , and the <<target>> continued to pour down in torrents .::::rain
Each man carried three days ' provisions ; they tramped along silently through the night ; stoppages by swollen <<target>> were frequent , and by daybreak the next morning they had only accomplished nine miles of their journey .::::streams
Early in the morning the townspeople had woke up to the fact that the army <<target>> gone , and there was a general exodus of all who could obtain conveyances .::::had
The Boers remained for some time in ignorance that the force whose <<target>> or destruction they had regarded as certain had slipped away .::::capture
They saw the tents , but the fact that neither men nor horses were visible puzzled them , and <<target>> was eleven o'clock before some of the more venturesome galloping down found that the English force had escaped .::::it
Then from all sides they <<target>> into the town .::::poured
Had they at once pursued they might still have overtaken the retreating force before nightfall ; but they immediately set to work to loot the great stores of provisions <<target>> behind , and to gather their pickings from the deserted houses of Dundee , and so let slip their opportunity , and no pursuit whatever was attempted .::::left
For four days the column continued its march , resting for <<target>> few hours each day and usually marching all night .::::a
The road was terribly bad , leading through narrow mountain passes , and had but a small force of the enemy held <<target>> Waschbrank gorge , where the sides were for three miles nearly perpendicular , a terrible calamity might have taken place .::::the
Happily , however , the Boers were in absolute ignorance of the road which the British troops were following , and <<target>> that they must have somewhere crossed the railway and were making their way down by the roads to its west .::::concluded
That they had gone through Helpmakaar does not appear to have occurred to them , for after marching <<target>> thirty miles to that town the column was as far off Ladysmith as when it started .::::some
The anxiety at the <<target>> town was intense .::::latter
The line being still uncut , the arrival of the column at <<target>> was known , but beyond that no communication could be received .::::helpmakaar
On Tuesday the 24th Colonel Dartnel arrived in Ladysmith with the news that the column was now twenty miles <<target>> , all well , and he at once returned to them with supplies and a small relief force .::::away
On Wednesday many of the men came in , and <<target>> Thursday the remainder arrived and were heartily greeted .::::on
On the 24th -- in order to divert the attention of Joubert and the Free State Boers , both of whom were converging upon General Yule 's column , still making <<target>> way through the passes -- a force composed of three regiments of cavalry , four of Colonial Mounted Infantry , three batteries , and four infantry regiments went out .::::its
The enemy were <<target>> near Reitfontein .::::found
No actual engagement took place , but for some hours an <<target>> and rifle duel was maintained and the Boers fell back .::::artillery
The number of casualties was not large , and these were principally among the Gloucester regiment , who , on entering a <<target>> supposed to be untenanted , were received by a heavy fire from a strong party of the enemy hidden there .::::valley
The fight , however , fulfilled the object for which the advance was undertaken , that of occupying <<target>> Boers ' attention and enabling the column from Dundee to make its way into Ladysmith unmolested .::::the
The Boers were now closing in on the latter town from <<target>> directions , and preparations for defence at once began .::::all
The town-hall and the schools were fitted up as <<target>> and everything arranged for the reception of wounded .::::hospitals
As the Boers had already been seen near Colenso , sixteen miles to the <<target>> , it was certain that the communications would ere long be cut .::::south
No more unsuitable place for a military camp could well have been selected than Ladysmith , which had indeed been chosen , years <<target>> the war was thought of , on account of its position on the railway , and the vicinity of the Klip river .::::before
The fact that the country immediately round was fertile and forage <<target>> obtainable no doubt influenced the military authorities in their selection .::::was
Lying in the heart of a mountainous country , it was commanded by <<target>> and rocky hills at a distance of from two to four miles .::::steep
Just as many castles built in the days before firearms were in use were rendered untenable against even the clumsy cannon of early days placed on <<target>> near , so the improvement in artillery and the possession of powerful modern guns by the Boers had gravely imperilled the position of Ladysmith .::::eminences
The military authorities could never have anticipated that the town would be <<target>> by foes armed with artillery that could carry over five miles .::::besieged
But such was the case now , and all there felt , as soon as it was <<target>> to defend the place till the last , that the position was a precarious one .::::decided
Fortunately , a considerable store of provisions had been collected , and so long <<target>> the line was open additions were being sent up by every train .::::as
The line was a single one , winding along through passes among the <<target>> , and therefore open to attack by small bodies of the enemy .::::hills
In point of size Ladysmith was <<target>> third largest town in Natal .::::the
Durban boasted a population of thirty thousand , Pietermaritzburg of twenty thousand , and Ladysmith <<target>> four thousand five hundred , being four hundred larger than that of Dundee .::::of
It was the point at which the line of railway forked , one branch running north <<target>> Glencoe to the Transvaal , the other northwest through Van Reenen 's Pass to Bloemfontein .::::through
It was a pretty straggling town with its <<target>> , government buildings and large stores .::::barracks
Almost all the houses were detached and standing in their own gardens , and as these were largely wooded its <<target>> was very picturesque , with the Klip river , a branch of the Tugela , running through it .::::appearance
The houses were , for the most part , one-storied , and <<target>> roofs were all painted white for the sake of coolness .::::the
No perfectly open town had ever before undergone a siege by an army of some thirty thousand <<target>> provided with excellent guns , and yet the garrison awaited the result with perfect confidence .::::men
On the 30th , the Boers being now in force on many of the hills around the town , and having inflicted the first annoyance upon Ladysmith by cutting the conduit that brought down the water-supply to the town from a reservoir among the hills , and so forced it for <<target>> future to depend upon a few wells and the muddy water of the river , it was determined to make an effort to drive them back and to gain possession of some of the hills from which it was now evident the town would stand a risk of being bombarded .::::the
Hitherto there had been considerable apathy in taking measures for <<target>> the enemy as far as possible out of range .::::keeping
A few redoubts thrown up during the last week and strongly held would have been invaluable , but it seemed to be considered by the military authorities <<target>> the siege could be but a short one , and that the Boers would speedily be driven off by the troops now pouring into Durban .::::that
An effort was now to be made to repair the consequences of this remissness and to drive the Boers off the <<target>> they occupied , and it was hoped that if a heavy blow were dealt them they would draw off altogether .::::positions
The forces of Joubert , Meyer , and the Free Staters were now all within <<target>> distance of a few miles , and were all to be beaten up .::::a
A force composed of six companies of the Royal Irish Fusiliers , four and a half of the Gloucesters , a mountain battery <<target>> a troop of Hussars started at midnight towards a hill known as Nicholson 's Nek , occupied by the Free Staters .::::and
Major General Hunter with a brigade of infantry , three batteries , and a small cavalry force were to attack Meyer 's commando to the east , <<target>> General White , with two infantry brigades , French 's cavalry , and six batteries of field artillery moved against Joubert 's force on Modder Spruit .::::while
It was hoped that the Boers , if defeated , would find their <<target>> barred by the force that had stated early for Nicholson 's Nek .::::retreat
All were well away from <<target>> town before daylight broke .::::the
At five o'clock in the morning the guns spoke out , and were at once <<target>> by the Boer artillery , and the roar of fire soon became general .::::answered
General White 's central column was screened by a ridge near the railway , and the big gun on Signal Hill directed <<target>> fire partly against the town and partly against the cavalry which could be seen by them in rear of the column .::::its
As only a few of the Volunteer Horse had been ordered to accompany the attacking force , Chris and his companions took up their <<target>> on an eminence that afforded a general view of the battle , and here a large number of the townspeople also gathered .::::position
The general plan of operations was that the two movable columns should form a rough arc of a <<target>> and , driving in both flanks of the Boers , sweep the whole force before them .::::circle
`` They have a great many guns , '' Peters said , as the rattle of the machine-guns and the thud of quick-firing one-pounders joined the continuous fire of several Boer batteries and the <<target>> roar of their big gun , `` and they seem to be in greater force than was supposed , for I can make out large reinforcements coming up to them from behind . ''::::deeper
Our artillery were first placed about four thousand yards from the Boer position , but as this was <<target>> higher ground than that occupied by our guns our fire did not appear to be effective .::::on
They were therefore moved forward some distance , supported by <<target>> battalions of the Rifles and the Dublin Fusiliers .::::two
The infantry force with them pushed forward rapidly and gained a crest from which they threatened to take the Boer position on Signal Hill in rear ; but the Boers , very strongly reinforced , moved <<target>> meet them , and heavy fighting took place , until the enemy 's force became so strong that they not only checked the further advance of the brigade , but threatened it on both flanks .::::to
Two batteries went to their assistance , but even with this aid they could not continue their advance , pressed <<target>> they were by greatly superior numbers and harassed by the fire of the Boer field batteries on the hill .::::as
At other points our advance <<target>> opposed as hotly .::::was
Nowhere were our <<target>> gaining ground .::::infantry
The enemy had not wasted their time , but had thrown up intrenchments on the steep hills they occupied , and from <<target>> shelters maintained a terrible fire , while their numerous machine-guns swept the ground with a hail of bullets and shells .::::these
On such ground the cavalry were useless , and the range of <<target>> Boer guns was much greater than that of our own .::::the
We ca n't see at all what is going on , <<target>> certainly the firing seems nearer than it was . ''::::but
All had thought the same though none <<target>> cared to suggest such a thing .::::had
there is a train coming <<target>> , '' Field said .::::in
`` I heard they were expecting a <<target>> of sailors with naval guns .::::party

Glad to be doing something <<target>> went down the hill .::::they
As they reached the station they saw a large detachment of <<target>> at work detraining some twelve-pounders and two large quick-firing guns .::::sailors
Teams of oxen were brought up , the sailors harnessed themselves to ropes , and with tremendous exertions <<target>> of the guns was taken up to an eminence , and at eleven it opened fire .::::one
It was but <<target>> in time .::::just
In steady order the columns were retiring with their faces towards the Boers , answering shot for shot , carrying off their wounded as they dropped , in spite of the terrible rifle <<target>> and the roar of the Boers ' batteries ; but as soon as the first naval gun opened fire , amid the cheers of the townspeople , the situation was changed .::::fire
The first two shells burst close to the Boer big gun , the third in the <<target>> of the artillerymen , and it was some time before its fire was resumed .::::midst
In the meantime the sailors had turned their attention to other Boer batteries which the field artillery <<target>> scarcely been able to reach , and one by one these were withdrawn over the crest .::::had
At one o'clock Colonel Hamilton 's brigade , which had hitherto been lying behind the crest they first occupied , in readiness to repel any counter- attack the Boers might make , now moved out and took up their position to cover the retirement of Hunter 's column and Howard 's brigade , <<target>> although the Boers pressed hotly upon them they held their ground steadily until their comrades had all reached their camp , and then marched in unhindered by the enemy , whose big cannon had now been finally silenced by the naval gun and their batteries for the most part obliged to retire .::::and
After seeing the naval gun open fire Chris had gone down to speak to Captain <<target>> , when he met two soldiers of a mountain battery carrying an injured comrade .::::brookfield
They took him into the <<target>> and then came out .::::hospital
Their shoulder-straps showed them to belong to the mountain battery that had gone out with the Royal Irish Fusiliers and the Gloucesters , of whom nothing had been <<target>> , though occasionally , in momentary intervals of fire , the sound of distant musketry could be made out in the direction of Nicholson 's Nek .::::heard
`` How are your <<target>> getting on ? ''::::party

It was not until the next day that the extent of the calamity was known , <<target>> a Boer came down with a white flag asking that doctors might be sent up .::::when
The little column instead of , as had been hoped , surprising the Boers had <<target>> been ambushed , being suddenly attacked by two strong parties of the enemy .::::itself

The Boers had , by taking advantage of every bit of cover , <<target>> up close to them , and a murderous fire was poured in .::::crept
The two regiments asked Colonel Carleton , who commanded them , to <<target>> them to charge with their bayonets and cut their way through .::::allow
He consented to allow the desperate attempt to be made , and the men were in the act of <<target>> bayonets when someone raised a white flag , and the Boers standing up advanced to receive the surrender .::::fixing
After this the laws of war permitted no further defence , and the men , half mad with <<target>> at the situation in which they were placed , threw down their rifles and were made prisoners .::::fury
This was at two o'clock in the afternoon , after the rest of the force had returned <<target>> Ladysmith ; and thus some nine hundred men fell into the hands of the Boers .::::to
Apart from this the loss was comparatively <<target>> considering the heat of the engagement .::::small
There were provisions calculated to last for two months , and no one <<target>> that long before that time General Buller would arrive to their rescue .::::doubted
So confident had the military authorities been , that not only had no defensive works been thrown up , but they <<target>> omitted to send the women and children , and the men unfitted to give active assistance , to the rear .::::had
On the following morning the scouts <<target>> a council of war .::::held
`` Now , '' Chris said , `` <<target>> have to decide the all-important question .::::we
It is quite certain that the town is going to be besieged , and I should say that the siege will <<target>> for some time , as nothing can be done to relieve them until a lot of troops arrive from home .::::last
We have shown at Dundee and Elandslaagte that our fellows can drive the Boers from their kopjes , but a force arriving to relieve <<target>> would have to fight its way through a tremendously mountainous district , and to capture at least eight or ten such positions .::::ladysmith
At Dundee and Elandslaagte the Boers had only a few guns , and the big <<target>> from Pretoria had not arrived , nor had they time to fortify themselves .::::one
`` It may be a couple of <<target>> before the place is relieved .::::months
Of course the question is , <<target>> we stay here or go ?::::shall
I do n't think we should be of much use here ; indeed , I do n't see that cavalry would be any good <<target>> all , whereas if a portion of the Boers push south we may be very useful in our own line of scouting .::::at
Still , this is a <<target>> for you to decide .::::question
You chose to make me your commander when at work , but we <<target>> all have an equal voice in a matter of this sort . ''::::should
The prospect of a long siege in which they could take but little active part was <<target>> a pleasant one , and it was decided at once that they should leave .::::not
`` Then I will go in to Captain <<target>> and ask his permission to go .::::brookfield
Now that we are in camp with <<target>> he must be consulted . ''::::him
They had since Elandslaagte taken their places as a part of the <<target>> Scouts , and had been drilled for some hours each day .::::maritzburg
They were already favourites among the corps , who were proud of the work they had done , and being a pleasant set of <<target>> their uncouth appearance , which had at first been viewed with much disfavour by many of their comrades , had been forgiven .::::lads
Chris went to the commander 's tent and <<target>> the matter and their decision before him .::::laid
`` I think that it is just as well that you should go , Chris , '' the officer <<target>> ; `` and indeed I was on the point of telling you that we are all leaving .::::said
For myself I can not understand why the cavalry should be kept here , and indeed I know <<target>> it is their opinion also , and that they have asked the general to let them leave .::::that
However , he has <<target>> to keep them .::::decided
I am sure it <<target>> a mistake .::::is
Before the siege is over forage is sure to run short , <<target>> half the cavalry will be dismounted before the end comes .::::and
However , I have seen him and pointed out <<target>> as scouts we should be useless here .::::that
He has given me leave to go , but has requested <<target>> to join the first troops that come up the line .::::me
When we are once away I shall give you leave to act altogether independently of us , which <<target>> I am sure suit you better than being kept for weeks perhaps at Colenso or Estcourt .::::will
Another thing I <<target>> do .::::will
I expect that General Buller will come on here , <<target>> it is certainly the most serious point at present .::::as
I will ask Yule to give you a letter of introduction to him , it will be useful ; <<target>> I have no doubt that he will give you a free hand , as I have done .::::and
I should not call upon General Buller in <<target>> rig-out , if I were you .::::that
I have heard he is somewhat of a martinet at the War Office , <<target>> we know that they have a very poor opinion of volunteers there . ''::::and
`` Volunteers have done good service at the Cape before now , sir , and have shown over and over again that a man can fight just as well in plain clothes as if he were <<target>> up to the chin in uniform ; and as the Boers are themselves nothing but volunteers , I should think that before this war is over the War Office will see its mistake . ''::::buttoned
`` I should think so indeed , Chris , but at <<target>> they have certainly not woke up to the fact .::::present
I see by the telegrams that the London Scottish and the London Irish have both volunteered almost to a <<target>> for service here , and that they have not even had a civil reply to their application .::::man
I tell you , lad , this war is going to be a big thing , and before it <<target>> over we may have both militia and volunteers out here , and perhaps troops from the colonies .::::is
I heard that some of the Australian colonies have already offered to send bodies of mounted men , <<target>> that our government are ordering out a larger number of men than was at first intended .::::and
I hear this morning that at <<target>> and Mafeking fighting has begun .::::kimberley
On the 24th Kimberley made a successful sortie , and <<target>> the 25th a general attack on Mafeking was repulsed .::::on
The fact that both these places are beleaguered , and that we have again been obliged to fall back here , and are likely to be cut <<target>> altogether , has evidently stirred them up , and they begin to understand that it is going to be a much bigger affair than they expected .::::off
`` I wrote to your mother yesterday at Durban , and told <<target>> that I intended to leave while it is still possible .::::her
My letter was in answer to one she wrote to me from Durban , begging me to keep you from undertaking what she called 'mad-brained business ' , and <<target>> some regret that you and the others had been allowed to form a separate corps , instead of being under the command of an experienced officer like myself .::::expressing
I told her that I thought that you would have less chance of coming to harm in <<target>> work than if you had to work in a regular way as the general ordered .::::scouting
If this sort of fighting -- I mean , of attacking in front every position the <<target>> choose to take -- goes on , our numbers will very speedily dwindle away .::::boers
In that case the Boers would <<target>> bolted without firing a shot .::::have
That it could have been done is shown by the fact that <<target>> cavalry did it , and encountered no difficulty on the way .::::the
Again , at Elandslaagte the object of keeping the road open would have been equally well attained if , after driving <<target>> out of the station , we had taken up a strong position there and waited for them to attack us .::::them
Therefore , Chris , I think that fighting in our way -- that is to say , in Boer fashion -- and trusting to skill as <<target>> as to shooting , you will be running a good deal less risk than you would in fighting under British generals in British fashion .::::much
We shall go off <<target>> this evening .::::quietly
We must keep a bright look-out on the way , for the trains have been fired upon , <<target>> at any moment the Boers may pull up the rails and block the roads altogether . ''::::and
Two hours later all was ready for a start , <<target>> just before sunset the corps rode out of Ladysmith .::::and
They had seen some parties of mounted men in the far distance , but none had come near them , and as <<target>> military authorities were well aware of the Boers being in the vicinity , there was nothing to be gained by scouting .::::the
But it was now decided that they were in advance of the point that any large number of the enemy <<target>> likely to reach , and might therefore strike across the country and resume what they considered their regular work .::::were
They had employed much of their spare time in training their horses and in teaching them to lie down <<target>> ordered , and thus share the shelter taken up by their masters , behind rocks or a wall .::::when
Riding across country they met more than one farmer trekking with <<target>> cattle and belongings towards the ferry across the Mooi river .::::his
These reported that the Boers had overrun the whole of the country north of the Tugela , <<target>> that some parties had already crossed at the ferry on the road between Helpmakaar and Greytown .::::and
Fugitives had come in from the villages on the other side , and complained that the Boers were looting everywhere , and had driven off thousands of <<target>> and numbers of horses , and had everywhere wantonly destroyed the furniture and everything they could not carry off , in the farmhouses they visited .::::cattle
A vigilant look-out was kept <<target>> the scouts advanced .::::as
On the second day after starting they encamped on a slight elevation near Mount Umhlumba , and early next morning they <<target>> a party of some twenty Boers riding in a direction that would bring them within rifle-shot of their camp .::::saw
All were at once <<target>> the alert .::::on
`` We will not go out and attack them , '' <<target>> said to the lads who were running towards their horses .::::chris
`` That would mean that though we might kill all <<target>> them , half of us would probably be shot .::::of
Get the picket ropes loose and the bridles on ready for mounting , <<target>> then leave the horses in charge of the natives where we camped .::::and
They will be out <<target>> sight there .::::of
When you have done that take <<target>> places quietly among the rocks .::::your
Do you , Capper and Carmichael , put yourselves twenty <<target>> thirty yards apart ; you are our best shots .::::or
When the Boers get within a thousand yards , which is as near as they will do if they keep <<target>> line they are going , open fire upon them and keep it up steadily , but not too fast .::::the
When they see that only two men are firing they will think that you are a couple <<target>> farmers whose place they have plundered , and who are determined to have their revenge .::::of
You are safe to hit some of them , and the others will decide upon wiping <<target>> out , and will probably leave their horses and crawl up in their usual style .::::you
When they get close it <<target>> be our turn .::::will
I do n't think many of them <<target>> likely to get away . ''::::are
His orders were carried out , and five minutes <<target>> the two rifles flashed out one after another .::::later
The Boers were riding <<target>> a clump .::::in
One was seen to fall , and the <<target>> of another gave a violent plunge .::::horse
`` Very good , '' exclaimed Chris , who , <<target>> the rest , was lying down behind a rock .::::like
`` Do n't <<target>> too fast .::::fire
Wait half a minute , and then each take another <<target>> , one a little time after the other . ''::::turn
No more of the Boers dropped , but the watchers , who had their <<target>> directed upon them , thought by their movements that two had been hit .::::glasses
Then they took a long sweep round to a point where the ground was broken , and a shallow donga ran <<target>> in a direction that would bring them within a hundred yards of the position occupied by their hidden assailants .::::up
There they were seen to dismount , and , after some talk , leaving all the horses <<target>> the charge of one man , probably one of the wounded , they entered the donga .::::in
Its course was irregular , and once or twice the <<target>> lads were able to get a shot at them .::::two
The Boers did not return the fire <<target>> hurried past the exposed points .::::but
As they approached a head was occasionally raised above the <<target>> to view the position , and then disappeared again .::::bank
The ground between the camp and the nearest point of the donga <<target>> thickly strewn with boulders , with bushes growing between them .::::was
The lads had all shifted <<target>> position to this side .::::their
`` Do n't open fire till I give <<target>> order , '' Chris said quietly .::::the
`` We have got <<target>> now . ''::::them
Except for a slight movement of the bushes , it would <<target>> have been known that the Boers had left the donga .::::not
Once or twice Capper and Carmichael caught a momentary glimpse of one <<target>> them , but held their fire , as Chris had said ,::::of
`` Let them come within twenty yards , then both fire at <<target>> , whether you catch a glimpse of them or not .::::once
Thinking that your rifles are discharged , they <<target>> all jump up and make a rush .::::will
Then it will be <<target>> turn . ''::::our
Presently a man 's head was seen peering <<target>> a rock at about the right distance .::::round
Both the rifles cracked at once , and a <<target>> fell prone on the ground beyond his shelter .::::boer
At the same moment there was a shout , and <<target>> comrades all sprang to their feet and rushed forward .::::his
A volley from the whole <<target>> the scouts flashed out .::::of
Twelve of the Boers fell , the others leapt back <<target>> their shelters , and in turn opened fire .::::behind
`` Keep in <<target>> ! ''::::shelter
`` They know now that we are two to their <<target>> , and will soon be making off . ''::::one
The combatants were so close to each other that neither dared expose shoulder or head to <<target>> aim , and after the first shots fired at the Boers all remained quiet .::::take
In any case there is no time to be lost in getting hold <<target>> their ponies , or at any rate in driving them off . ''::::of
As two or three minutes again passed without a shot being fired by the Boers , Chris was in the act of calling off half the troop to watch the donga and fire at the Boers <<target>> they saw them running past the exposed points , when at this moment he heard the horses returning , and directly afterwards one of the lads he had sent off ran up to him .::::if
Some distance behind I can see <<target>> lot of cattle and waggons .::::a
I suppose they were making for home <<target>> they heard the firing . ''::::when
Just at this moment two or three shots rang out , <<target>> that the surviving Boers were seen running down the donga .::::telling
`` Never mind them , '' Chris shouted ; `` <<target>> are going to be attacked by a big party .::::we
Put down your rifles all of you , and pile the stones on the <<target>> , so as to make a shelter , as quickly as you can .::::crest
We shall have <<target>> few minutes .::::a

He ran up <<target>> the top .::::to
Some of us would certainly not <<target>> off without a bullet .::::get

Those on the right soon caught <<target>> of the clump of horses .::::sight
`` They will soon know all about it , '' <<target>> said , as two of them galloped off .::::chris

Now , are <<target>> all ready ?::::you
Well , then , <<target>> to work ! ''::::set
In a moment an almost incessant rattle of musketry broke out upon the astounded Boers , who , turning their horses , scattered at full gallop to escape <<target>> hail of bullets ; but more than a dozen had fallen before they were beyond the range of the Mausers and were fully two thousand yards away .::::the
`` I do n't think we <<target>> stop , '' Chris said .::::need
`` Fill up your magazines again , <<target>> then make for the horses . ''::::and
Directly the first party of Boers had been seen , Jack and Japhet had set <<target>> work taking down and rolling up the tents and loading the spare horses .::::to
`` Jump up , '' Chris said <<target>> them , `` we are off .::::to
Mind you keep <<target>> with us .::::well
With a shout they rode off at full <<target>> towards the great herd of cattle .::::gallop
As they approached , the Kaffirs <<target>> were driving them fled .::::who
Separating as they rode , waving their hats and shouting at the top of their voices , the lads dashed at the herd , <<target>> at once turned and went off at a rate that would have astonished animals accustomed only to small pastures and other enclosures .::::who
`` Do n't press them too much , '' Chris had ordered <<target>> the band separated , `` or they will break down .::::before

The Boers wo n't be far behind <<target>> when we get there . ''::::us
The enemy indeed had not noticed them leave the little kopje , as they were hidden by a slight fall in the ground <<target>> they descended , and it was not until they observed a commotion among the cattle that they perceived what had happened .::::where
Then , furious not only at the loss they had suffered , but at <<target>> their booty driven away , they mounted and pursued in hot haste .::::seeing
But the party had obtained a start of fully a mile , and the valley was <<target>> by the fugitives while the Boers were still half that distance in their rear .::::reached
Chris rode along until he came to a narrow and defensible point ; the horses were taken a hundred yards on and made to lie down , and <<target>> and his sixteen companions then ran back and took up their positions among the rocks on each side of the track and the slopes above it .::::he
Scarcely had the band taken cover in the gorge <<target>> the Boers appeared some five hundred yards away .::::than
`` Open fire <<target>> once ! ''::::at
Chris shouted , `` the farther they have to come <<target>> fire the less they will like it . ''::::under
The rifles at <<target>> spoke out .::::once
The lads had all used the boulders behind which they crouched as rests for their <<target>> , and confident of their shooting and their position , their aim was deadly .::::rifles
Five or six of the leading Boers fell and several horses , the rest came to an abrupt pause , <<target>> back some little distance and then dismounted , and leaving their horses in shelter , disappeared from sight .::::galloped
In a short time a dropping fire was <<target>> from both sides of the valley .::::opened
`` Do n't fire unless you see a man , '' Chris ordered , `` there <<target>> gaps on the hillside that they ca n't pass without giving you a chance .::::are
When they learn that it is death to leave <<target>> , they will soon get sick of it .::::shelter
Keep yourselves well <<target>> cover . ''::::under
The rifle duel continued <<target>> an hour .::::for
As Chris had said would be the case , after seven or eight had fallen , as they were trying to make rushes across <<target>> of ground where boulders afforded no cover , the rest became very cautious , and at last only an occasional shot was heard .::::pieces
`` We will fall back now , '' Chris said , `` for aught we <<target>> a party of them may be working round somewhere to take us in rear .::::know
Still , we do not want <<target>> be caught between two fires .::::to
Let four on each flank crawl back ; keep well among the <<target>> , and do n't let them catch sight of you .::::rocks
We will fire occasionally to let them <<target>> that we are still here .::::know
It will be a long time before they venture to crawl up and discover that we have gone , an hour most likely , and by <<target>> time the cattle will be a dozen miles on their way to Estcourt , and the Boers are not likely to follow them . ''::::that
Ten minutes later all <<target>> in their saddles .::::were
They had left the horses at a spot where there was a sharp elbow in <<target>> gorge , and their retreat could not be seen from the valley below .::::the
They cantered along in high glee ; not one had received a scratch , while some twelve of the first party of Boers had <<target>> , and fully fifteen of the second , and it was certain that at least as many more must have been wounded .::::fallen
They must have seen that we are better mounted than they are , <<target>> have been afraid that we should in turn take the offensive .::::and
I should not be surprised if they stay where they are all day , and do n't venture to mount <<target>> ride off till it gets dark '' `` You are something like a leader , '' Peters said enthusiastically .::::and
This is the second fight we have had with the Boers , and we have thrashed them well each time , although the first time <<target>> were twice as strong , and in the second something like four times , and we have not lost one of our number .::::they
I am sure if we had been caught where we were without you with us , at least half of <<target>> would have been killed , and we should have been lucky to get away with only that . ''::::us
Riding without pressing their horses , it was two <<target>> before they overtook the party with the cattle .::::hours
These had now broken <<target>> a walk .::::into
`` We kept them at it till half an hour ago , '' Willesden said apologetically , when they came up , `` but the Kaffirs <<target>> that unless we gave them a rest half of them would drop , so we let them go easy till you came up . ''::::said
`` We have given the Boers such a thrashing that <<target>> is no fear of their continuing the pursuit .::::there
Unless we meet some more of these thieves , <<target>> can go on as quietly as we like .::::we
I have some sort of respect for men like those we met at Dundee and Elandslaagte , who fight manfully and stoutly , but for these raiding scoundrels who <<target>> come out to rob and plunder , and do wanton damage to quiet people , one feels only disgust , and shoots them without the least compunction . ''::::only
There was a general <<target>> of agreement .::::chorus
`` Did they get near <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::you
`` Not within about <<target>> hundred yards .::::four
They got it so hot at first that they dismounted and took to the rocks ; they pushed on for a bit , and if the whole hillside had been covered with boulders we might <<target>> had some sharp fighting , but there were some open spaces to be crossed , and after getting over two or three of them they found it safer to lie as close as rabbits .::::have
For aught we know they <<target>> there still . ''::::are
They travelled quietly till sunset , and then halted in <<target>> open valley where there was water and good grass .::::an
Half the company kept watch by turns , being posted with their horses some half a mile out in the country , taking the animals with them not only because they could <<target>> back more quickly , but because they knew the horses would hear any approaching sound long before their masters were able to do so , and would evince their uneasiness unmistakably .::::fall
There was , however , no alarm , and two days later , travelling by easy stages , they <<target>> at Estcourt , where their arrival with so large a number of cattle created quite a sensation .::::arrived
They at once put up a notice at the post-office , that all persons who had been <<target>> by the Boers could come and inspect the herd and take all animals bearing their brand .::::raided
It soon appeared that the cattle were the property of <<target>> farmers living within a short distance of each other .::::four
They had arrived in Estcourt with their families two days previously , weary and broken <<target>> with fatigue , hunger , and the loss and ruin of their property .::::down
Their gratitude was deep indeed at this wholly unexpected recovery of a large portion of their herds , and they started the <<target>> morning , mounted on some ponies they had picked up for a trifle , to drive them down the country .::::next
Chris saw the officer in command as soon as they arrived in the town , <<target>> gave him an outline of their adventure , upon which he was warmly congratulated .::::and
`` Shall I send in a written <<target>> to you , sir ? ''::::report
`` No , you are not under my orders ; and I should say that <<target>> had better write and post it to the officer commanding the force at Maritzburg .::::you

`` Is the road <<target>> to Ladysmith ? ''::::closed
`` Yes , <<target>> days since .::::two
General French , who is ordered to Port Elizabeth to take command of the cavalry brigade that is forming to <<target>> back the Boers who have crossed the Orange River , came down in the last train that got out .::::drive
It was hotly fired upon by the Boers , but luckily they had <<target>> taken up the rails , and the train got through safely .::::not
We have a little fort here , and have been throwing up entrenchments , but <<target>> they come in any force there is not much hope of our getting off .::::if
We have an armored train , which yesterday ran to within a mile or so of Colenso <<target>> being interfered with , though several parties of the enemy could be seen in the distance .::::without
I have great hopes that we shall get half a battalion up from Maritzburg to-morrow ; if so , by loopholing the houses and <<target>> up some breastworks , we ought to be able to keep the Boers out of the place , unless they come in force .::::throwing
At any rate , I should advise you to scout next <<target>> beyond the Mooi River and to make Maritzburg your head-quarters .::::time
You have done marvellously well in getting away from that party you met , but you might not be so lucky next time , for <<target>> they push on they are sure in a short time to be strong all over the country between the Tugela and the Mooi . ''::::as
This , after some consultation , <<target>> agreed to by the troop .::::was
There was no reason for haste , and they rode by <<target>> stages down to Maritzburg , stopping at Weston and Hawick .::::easy
Many of their friends had gone down to Durban , but some <<target>> remained , and from these they received a hearty welcome .::::still
All found letters awaiting them , for it had been arranged that as it <<target>> be impossible to give any address , these should be sent to Maritzburg .::::would
Troops were coming up fast from Durban , <<target>> there was already a strong brigade there .::::and
Chris called upon the brigadier and presented General Yule 's letter , <<target>> his own report of the fight with the Boers subsequently .::::and
`` This shows what can be done by young fellows who are good shots and good <<target>> , and who , I may say , Mr. King , have been admirably commanded .::::riders
What are your <<target>> now ?::::wishes
There are two or three troops of volunteer horse here ; <<target>> you wish to be attached to one of them ?::::would
Of course , if you do so there will be no difficulty about it ; but really , <<target>> think that you would be more useful in carrying on your work in your own way . ''::::i
Chris heard that it was generally known that the Portuguese officials , who had long been influenced by Boer money <<target>> from the Uitlanders , were still winking at the practice , although it was a breach of neutrality .::::extracted
So much indignation was expressed on the subject at Maritzburg that Chris , one day <<target>> the party assembled at the spot where their horses were tethered , said :::::when
`` I want to have a <<target>> talk with you all .::::serious
You have all heard that immense quantities of <<target>> and dynamite are passing through Lorenzo Marques .::::arms
Now , at present we do n't <<target>> much for us to do here .::::see
My idea is , that if we could manage to blow up the bridge across the river that divides Portuguese territory <<target>> the Transvaal , we should do an infinitely greater service than by killing any number of plundering Boers . ''::::from
His troop looked at <<target>> other in surprise .::::each
`` You are not really <<target>> earnest , Chris ? ''::::in
Peters said ; `` it would <<target>> a tremendous business . ''::::be
`` It would be a big business , no doubt , but <<target>> was never more earnest in my life than in proposing it .::::i
Now that we know how strong the Boers are round Ladysmith , and what terribly hard work it will be for an army to fight its way through <<target>> those hills , we can see that the first calculations as to the time when it can be relieved are a good deal short of the mark .::::all
There must be at least twenty thousand men collected here to do it , and I think it is <<target>> likely to be the end of January than the end of December before the Boers are driven off .::::more
We have in the one case seven weeks and in the other twelve before the place is relieved , and we begin to turn the tables on the Boers ; and according to the way we <<target>> my idea out it depends whether we are back here by the end of the year or by the end of January -- that is , I acknowledge , if we get back at all .::::carry
`` I have been <<target>> it over .::::thinking
There are two ways <<target>> doing it .::::of
We can go on board a ship touching <<target>> Durban and going on to Lorenzo Marques .::::at
I do n't say that we could not all do it , but it would <<target>> better to choose only four ; a larger number would excite more observation .::::be
Those who go will of <<target>> take dynamite with them .::::course
We can buy <<target>> at Durban .::::that
At Lorenzo Marques we should assume the <<target>> of four young Irish fellows .::::character
We know there are lots of them already up there , and Germans too , fighting in the Boer ranks <<target>> I am glad to know that they got peppered at Elandslaagte , although that is not to the point .::::and
We should go as four Irish lads who have <<target>> across from America to fight for the Boers .::::come
We have heard plenty of Irish in the mines and at Johannesburg , <<target>> shall be able to put enough brogue in our talk to pass .::::so
I know from what I have heard that a trip to the Portuguese officials would be quite sufficient for them to pass anything without examination ; but even if they did open our cases and find dynamite in them , we <<target>> account for it by saying that we had been told before starting that it would be the handiest thing to take with us , and would be of more assistance to the Boers than anything we could bring them .::::could
`` No doubt some of the passengers would know that we got on board at Durban , but if any questions were asked we could account for that by saying <<target>> the ship we came over in , was going on to Australia , and therefore we had been obliged to land and take another on to Lorenzo Marques .::::that
Once landed , we should of course take a train for Komati-poort , and <<target>> off it after dark at some station a few miles from there .::::slip
Then , you know , we could first reconnoitre the bridge , and when we had settled <<target>> the best place for the dynamite , we could put it there the next night .::::on
I know a good deal <<target>> the use of dynamite .::::about
It is not like gunpowder , that you have to put in a hole and fasten up tightly , you only have <<target>> lay it upon an iron girder or arch , and light your fuse and leave it to do its work . ''::::to
The boys listened with increasing <<target>> to his proposal .::::surprise
`` And what is <<target>> other plan ? ''::::your
Peters asked after <<target>> long pause .::::a
Of course in that case we shall take the dynamite with us , and then must be guided <<target>> circumstances as to our course and what we should do when we got to the bridge . ''::::by
There was again a long silence , then Brown said : `` If anyone but you had proposed it , Chris , I should have <<target>> at it as impossible , but for myself I have come to have such confidence in you that I believe you would manage it .::::scoffed
There can be no doubt that it would be <<target>> grand thing if we could do it .::::a
Except by the bridge , even in the best times , I should think , from what <<target>> said , it would be quite impossible for them to take heavy things like cannon across .::::he
Anyhow , I am ready <<target>> go with you . ''::::to
`` I should certainly not <<target>> anyone to go .::::ask
Those who are willing to <<target>> so must volunteer .::::do
Of course we only combined for the purpose of acting <<target>> scouts , and no one ever contemplated doing more .::::as
So far , we have , as all allow , carried out that object well ; and I have no doubt that those who do not care to join in what is <<target>> sort of forlorn hope , will continue to do well after we have started on it , and of course I shall , if I get back , rejoin them .::::a
My scheme would , no doubt , be considered a very wild one , but <<target>> can see no reason why , with good luck , it should not succeed .::::i
Indeed , I believe that it will succeed , if , when we arrive <<target>> , we do not find that the Boers are guarding the bridge .::::there
Of course , if they do so there is <<target>> little hope of carrying the matter out .::::but
They will know the importance of the bridge to them , and how greatly its destruction would be desired by the British Government , <<target>> may think it possible that such an attempt as I propose would be made , and take precautions to prevent its success .::::and
`` I do not mean <<target>> throw away my life .::::to
If , when I get there , I find that it is next to impossible to carry the matter out , I shall give it up ; <<target>> even then the information I should get about matters up there , both as to the Boers and the Swazis , would be of use .::::but
We know that Boer agents have been doing their utmost to get the Basutos to join them , and it is likely that they may be trying to induce <<target>> Zulus and Swazis to do the same ; and even if we fail in the principal object , I should say that the time would not be wasted .::::the
When I am up there , I can , of course , get news as to how the war is going on , and <<target>> I find that our forces are pushing up into the Transvaal , I shall make straight across the country and join them .::::if
I have been thinking over the matter a good deal since we came here , and made up my mind that anyhow <<target>> shall try to carry it out , so I now resign the leadership , and also for the present my membership .::::i
Now , I do n't want <<target>> influence you in any way .::::to
It has all come <<target>> upon you .::::suddenly
You had better talk <<target>> over together .::::it
All I ask you is that you will not say a <<target>> about it to anyone , not even to your relations .::::word
`` Not only because , as I know would be the case , they would be afraid of having anything to <<target>> with what they would consider an absolutely mad scheme , but because a chance word might prove fatal to success .::::do
As everyone knows , there are a great number of Dutch in the colony , who , although they may not be openly hostile , are in favour of <<target>> Boers , and will no doubt keep them acquainted with every movement of troops here , and can have no difficulty in communicating with them by native runners .::::the
Were one of our friends even to mention it casually <<target>> we had gone north , suspicions might be aroused .::::that
Therefore I beg that no one will breathe a word about the <<target>> , but that you will decide for yourselves without consulting anyone .::::matter
I shall leave you now , and we <<target>> meet here at the same time to-morrow .::::will
You will have had time <<target>> think it over then .::::to
I wish to say before I go that I do n't consider that the success <<target>> my plan depends upon my having the whole twenty of you with me .::::of
I repeat , that four <<target>> be quite sufficient .::::would
`` There are advantages as well as <<target>> in having only that number .::::disadvantages
We should travel without exciting so much notice ; we should have less difficulty <<target>> food ; we could conceal ourselves more easily in case we were pursued .::::about
On the other hand , with a stronger party we <<target>> repulse an attack if chased by the Boers .::::could
So you see I really do not want <<target>> than three of you to join .::::more
I think four is the best number , and should be glad if only two besides Brown wished to go with me ; but at <<target>> same time if more desire it , of course , as we are all comrades , they would have a right to go . ''::::the
So saying he turned away , leaving <<target>> others to talk the matter over .::::the
They went through their usual drill that afternoon <<target>> any allusion being made to the subject .::::without
First , Brown , do you stick to what you said <<target>> , or do you think better of it ? ''::::yesterday
`` Certainly I stick to <<target>> , '' Brown said .::::it
`` When I say a <<target>> I mean it . ''::::thing
`` And how about <<target>> others ? ''::::the
`` I have made up my mind to go with you , <<target>> , '' Peters said , `` and so has Willesden .::::chris
Field and Capper and Sankey would all go with you if you wanted to take more than four , and all would go if you wanted <<target>> troop ; but if you would rather only have three of us , it is settled that Brown , Willesden and I go . ''::::the
I am glad that you would all go if you were wanted ; but really I <<target>> that four would be the best number , so we will consider that as settled .::::think
And now there is one other thing <<target>> want to ask you about .::::i
You see , we have no right to take any money out <<target>> the common fund , but we shall have some heavy expenses .::::of
In the first place we shall want , I should say , a couple of hundred pounds of dynamite ; <<target>> we shall have to take some natives with us , a couple of Zulus and two or three Swazis .::::then
There will be no difficulty in getting them , as so many have <<target>> thrown out of employment owing to the farmers losing their herds .::::been
We may find it useful to make presents to chiefs as we go along , and , <<target>> course , we shall have to take a certain amount of provisions for the party .::::of
Have you any objection to our each taking <<target>> our share out of the bank ?::::half
Nothing has been drawn at present , and with a couple of hundred pounds between us <<target>> shall have enough and to spare for however long we may be away . ''::::we
There was a <<target>> of agreement .::::chorus
`` We are all awfully sorry that you <<target>> going , Chris , '' Field said .::::are
`` It wo n't be the <<target>> without you at all .::::same
We have agreed to ask you to <<target>> a leader during your absence . ''::::nominate
`` I would much rather not <<target>> that , '' Chris said .::::do
`` Everyone has done equally well , and it is <<target>> question that you should settle among yourselves . ''::::a
`` We have talked it over and agree that <<target>> shall never be able to fix on one .::::we
Suppose our votes were divided between four and five I <<target>> n't think we should feel more comfortable afterwards .::::do
We would rather put all the names in a hat and <<target>> one out , just leaving it to chance . ''::::draw
Agree first that , as we have done up till now , all important matters shall be discussed and decided by vote , then draw all the names from a hat and let each be leader for a week in the order in <<target>> they come out , with the proviso that if as time goes on you find that you can have more confidence in one than another , you can by a majority of three to one elect him as permanent leader . ''::::which
`` That would be a very good plan , '' Carmichael said , `` but , you see , the difficulty is that , supposing we were <<target>> to attack the Boers or the Boers attack us , the plan the leader fixed on might not seem to us at all the best .::::going
In the two fights we have had there was not that difficulty , for everyone felt that the plan you <<target>> was the best , and indeed much better than any of us would have been likely to think of .::::adopted
I do n't say that that <<target>> occur , but it might .::::would
It is not everyone who could fix upon the best thing <<target>> be done all at once as you did . ''::::to
Chris thought for <<target>> minute .::::a
`` I would suggest , '' he said , `` that in such a case as <<target>> mention the leader should tell the next two on the list what he proposed .::::you
If both disagreed with him there <<target>> be a general vote .::::must
I should hope such a thing would never occur , because the loss of five minutes <<target>> sometimes be disastrous , though in some cases it might not make any difference .::::would
Still , that is the best <<target>> I can think of .::::plan
There is no occasion for you <<target>> decide that straight off .::::to
At any rate , if you should find that any arrangement you make does not act perfectly <<target>> , I should advise you to join Captain Brookfield 's troop and act with him . ''::::well
The general opinion was strongly in <<target>> of Chris 's suggestion .::::favour
It was agreed that at any rate the <<target>> leader should be chosen by chance .::::first
Carmichael 's name came first <<target>> of the hat .::::out
Now , Chris , about <<target>> spare horses . ''::::the
`` I should like to <<target>> one of them .::::take
We may have to gallop for it , and it is of no use our being <<target>> mounted if we are hampered with a pony that can not keep up with us .::::well
We have only to lighten its load by getting rid of most of its <<target>> , and then we should be free to go our own pace .::::burden
`` I should like to <<target>> one of our Kaffirs .::::take
They have both turned out very well , and have a <<target>> idea of cooking , and are accustomed to our ways .::::good
I do n't care which I have , but <<target>> should certainly like to have one of them .::::i
He would stick to the spare horse , while the other natives <<target>> be all right if they scattered and shifted for themselves . ''::::would
`` Would you not like two <<target>> horses , Chris ? ''::::spare
He would carry our stores , and I should <<target>> two native ponies to take the dynamite along .::::get
Certainly there would be no danger if we go through Zululand , and , I should think , not until we get north of the Swazis ' country ; for <<target>> I know there are Boers settled among them , a good many would of course have joined their army , and it would be easy to avoid the others .::::though
The danger will only lie in the <<target>> part of the journey . ''::::last
`` Then you have settled <<target>> go by land ? ''::::to
`` Yes , I have decided to <<target>> all the way on horseback .::::go
We might find difficulties with the Portuguese at Lorenzo Marques , and if we manage to blow up the <<target>> , should have no horses , and should have a very bad time indeed in getting back .::::bridge
If I can get dynamite here I shall go all <<target>> way by land , and it would be safer .::::the
No doubt the Boers have spies at Durban , and we might have difficulty in hiring a craft to take us to St. Lucia , and our <<target>> with horses and five or six natives would be safe to attract the attention of someone looking out for news to send to the Boers .::::starting
A little west of Krantzkop there must be either a drift <<target>> a bridge or a ferry where it crosses the Tugela .::::or
I shall of course avoid Eshowe , and then keep along inside the Zulu frontier as far as <<target>> Maputa , which is its northern boundary , then we shall cross the Lebombo range into Swaziland .::::the
I do n't know how far it would be by the way we should have to <<target>> , but as the crow flies it is about three hundred miles from here .::::go
I suppose , what with the detours and passes <<target>> so on , it will be four hundred .::::and
Ordinarily that distance could be done in twenty days , but we must allow a good <<target>> longer than that ; fifteen miles a day is the utmost we can calculate upon .::::bit
However , in about a month after we <<target>> we ought to be there or thereabouts .::::start
Coming back we should do it more quickly , as we should have got <<target>> of our weight and need not be bothered with pack ponies . ''::::rid
`` You talk as coolly about it , '' Field laughed , `` <<target>> if you were going out for a few days ' picnic . ''::::as
`` It is the same sort of thing , '' Chris said , `` except that <<target>> will be longer , a bit rougher , and a good deal more interesting . ''::::it
`` When will <<target>> start ? ''::::you
`` As soon as possible ; all I have to <<target>> about are the dynamite and stores for the journey .::::see
We know pretty well by this <<target>> what we shall want .::::time
We are sure to be able to buy mealies and <<target>> bullock when we want one from the natives .::::a
Some tea and coffee , a dozen tins of preserved milk , and half a hundredweight of biscuits , in <<target>> of finding ourselves at a lonely camp with no native kraals near , and we shall be all right .::::case
Of course we will take a gallon or two of paraffin , a frying-pan , <<target>> small kettle , and so on , and a lantern that will burn paraffin .::::a
We will fill up our pouches with a hundred rounds of rifle cartridges and <<target>> for our revolvers , and then I think we shall be ready .::::fifty
Now mind , the success of our enterprise depends <<target>> upon your all keeping the secret absolutely .::::entirely
Neither Willesden , Brown , nor Peters have <<target>> here to bother themselves about their absence .::::friends
I shall write four or five letters , with dates a week or ten days apart , and <<target>> them from here , and leave them for you to post one by one to my mother .::::direct
Be sure you send them <<target>> the right order .::::in
As she will suppose that we are stopping here quietly , and <<target>> of all harm , she wo n't be uneasy about me .::::out
Peters ' and Willesden 's friends have gone to England , so <<target>> are all right , and Brown 's are at the Cape .::::they
When these matters were arranged , Chris saw Jack , <<target>> the Kaffir agreed without hesitation to go with him .::::and
He had been so well treated since he joined them that he had <<target>> quite attached to Chris , who generally gave him his orders .::::become
He was only told they were going up <<target>> an expedition to Zululand and Swaziland .::::on
`` I want you to find <<target>> good Zulu and two Swazis .::::two
Do you think that you <<target>> do that ? ''::::could
`` There are plenty of <<target>> here , baas .::::them
I look about and <<target>> good men .::::get
What shall I tell them that <<target>> will have to do ? ''::::they
We shall only take one of the spare <<target>> , you will look after him . ''::::horses
`` Will they have <<target>> , baas ?::::guns
All men like to <<target>> guns . ''::::have
`` Yes , they may as well carry <<target>> , and you too , Jack . ''::::guns
`` Much better for men <<target>> have guns , baas .::::to
They would be thought nothing <<target>> without them . ''::::of
`` All right Jack , there shall be no difficulty <<target>> that ; the stores are full of them . ''::::about
Men entering the volunteer corps , or who intended to do any fighting , sold the rifles they had previously used and obtained those of Government pattern and <<target>> the regulation cartridge , so that for ten pounds Chris got hold of five really good weapons , carefully selecting those that carried the same-sized cartridge .::::carrying
`` You can take whichever you like , '' he said to Jack , who had gone with him to buy them ; `` and I shall tell the men <<target>> engage that if at the end of the journey I am well satisfied with their behaviour , I shall give them the guns in addition to their pay . ''::::i
A few hours afterwards Jack brought <<target>> four natives for his inspection .::::up
Having been thrown out of their employment by the events of the past fortnight , they were glad of a <<target>> job , and were highly satisfied when they were offered wages considerably higher than those they had before received .::::fresh
All preparations were completed by the following evening , and the next morning at <<target>> , after bidding their comrades a hearty farewell , the little party started .::::daybreak
The four lads were no longer <<target>> in the guise of farmers .::::dressed
These suits were carried in the packs to <<target>> resumed when they neared the Transvaal .::::be
They now dressed in the tweeds they had worn <<target>> Johannesburg , and either felt hats or straw .::::at
Behind them Jack led the spare horse , and the four new men stepped lightly along with their muskets slung behind them <<target>> the side of two strong Basuto ponies , each carrying a couple of boxes containing half a hundredweight of dynamite .::::by
The spare horse carried the flour , paraffin , fuses , and other <<target>> , which brought up the weight to a hundred and twenty pounds .::::stores
This was somewhat lighter than that carried by the ponies , but they were anxious <<target>> keep it in good condition in case one of their own gave out .::::to
The baggage had all been very carefully packed , so <<target>> even when going fast it might not be displaced .::::that
They had found no difficulty in obtaining the dynamite , as several <<target>> the stores kept it for the use of the mines .::::of
They made no difficulty in selling it , and would <<target>> have been sorry to part with their whole stock .::::not
In view of the possibility of a siege , it was not an <<target>> that any sane man would care to keep on the premises .::::article
Chris had gone round to these stores and had obtained an offer from each , and as he said that he intended to accept the <<target>> tender , it was offered to him at a price very much below what he would ordinarily have had to give for it .::::lowest
The cases were sewn up in canvas , on which was <<target>> respectively , Tea , Sugar , Biscuits , and Rice .::::painted
Travelling five hours and halting at ten o'clock at a farmhouse that was still tenanted , and <<target>> travelling from half-past three until eight , they made about twenty-five miles the first day .::::again
Then they encamped at a spot where there was a small spring and consequently good feed <<target>> the horses , and knee-haltering them and taking off their saddles they turned them loose .::::for
The natives had collected fuel as they went <<target>> , and a fire was soon made .::::along
When the kettle approached boiling , some slices of bacon , of <<target>> they had brought thirty pounds with them , were fried .::::which
There was no occasion to make bread , as <<target>> had enough for a two days ' supply .::::they
The natives parched some mealies ( Indian corn ) in the frying-pan when the bacon was done , the <<target>> serving as a condiment that they highly appreciated , and they quenched their thirst from the spring .::::fat
Four days ' travelling took them <<target>> the drift across the Tugela .::::to
So far their journey <<target>> been wholly uneventful .::::had
Before crossing the next day they had <<target>> long talk with the two Zulus .::::a
Their language differed somewhat from that of Jack , but Chris understood them without difficulty ; for a considerable portion of the labourers in the <<target>> at Johannesburg were Zulus , and mixing with these , as Chris had done , he understood them even better than he did Jack .::::mines
The different routes were discussed , and the position of kraals , at which mealies <<target>> the five natives and the horses could be purchased , and meat possibly obtained .::::for
This , unless they bought a sheep , would be in the form of biltong , that is , strips of meat dried <<target>> being hung up in the sun and wind , and similar to the jerked meat of the prairies and pampas of America .::::by
The points at which water <<target>> be obtained were discussed .::::could
While passing through Zululand there would be no occasion whatever for vigilance by <<target>> or a watch at night , for there perfect order reigned .::::day
Here and there resident magistrates were stationed , and <<target>> these points a few white traders had settled .::::at
All disputes between the natives were ordinarily decided by their own chiefs , but in serious cases an appeal <<target>> be made to the nearest magistrate , who at once interfered in cases of violence or gross injustice .::::could
At the first kraal they came to they <<target>> that the natives were everywhere much excited .::::learned
They were most anxious to be allowed to join in the war against their old enemies , and were greatly disappointed on learning <<target>> the magistrates that this was only a white man 's war , and that no others must take part in it .::::from
If , however , the Boers invaded their territory <<target>> would of course be allowed to defend themselves .::::they
Some of the Zulus urged with reason , that though the English might wish to make it a white man 's war , the Boers did not desire it to be so , for they knew <<target>> they had been urging the Swazis and the Basutos to join them against the English , and that offers of many rifles and much plunder had been made also to some of their own chiefs .::::that
To this the magistrates could only reply , that they knew of old that the Boers ' words could <<target>> be trusted , and that they were always ready to break any arrangement that they had made .::::not
`` They would like you to join them , '' they said , `` because <<target>> would take your help and afterwards turn against you and steal your land .::::they
You know well enough that we have always stood between you and them ; but they would know that if you had joined <<target>> against us we should be angry , and after our war with them was over would no longer protect you . ''::::them
The Zulus , from their knowledge of the <<target>> , felt that this would be so .::::boers
But in any case no offers made to them would have induced them to side with the Boers ; and it <<target>> the general hope that something might occur which would induce the English to allow them to attack their enemies .::::was
Chris and his friends had laid aside their bandoliers , retaining only the cartridges carried in their belts , in order to assume the appearance of <<target>> merely travelling for sport , and as they went on they generally managed to shoot deer enough for the needs of the whole party .::::englishmen
Occasionally they slept in the kraals of chiefs , but greatly preferred their own little tents as the <<target>> in them was often blinding , and more than once the attacks of vermin kept them awake .::::smoke
Still , it would have been a slight to refuse such invitations , and they had <<target>> go to the kraals as it was necessary to frequently buy supplies of mealies .::::to
At times the travelling was very rough , and with the utmost exertions they could not make <<target>> than twelve or fourteen miles a day , and at other times they could make five-and-twenty .::::more
Without the supply of Indian corn , the ponies could <<target>> have continued this rate of going without breaking down .::::not
The native horses are accustomed occasionally to make very long journeys , and can perform from sixty to eighty miles <<target>> a day , but after such an exertion they will need a week 's rest before making another effort .::::in
With their Basuto masters they are <<target>> called upon to do so .::::not
When one of these makes a long journey he will leave his pony with the person he visits and return on a fresh mount , or if he returns <<target>> his own home after his first day 's journey he will take a fresh horse from his own stock , which may vary from five to fifty ponies .::::to
As they rode they seldom talked of <<target>> work that was to be done .::::the
Until they saw the country , the positions , and approach , no plans could possibly be formed , and they <<target>> treated the matter as if it were a mere sporting expedition in a new country , and enjoyed themselves thoroughly .::::therefore
They had heavy work in crossing the Lebombo range , and , travelling <<target>> day 's journey farther west , turned to the north again .::::a
They were now in Swaziland , <<target>> wild and mountainous country .::::a
Here also they were hospitably received where they stopped , although the Swazis were deeply aggrieved by the shameful manner in which England <<target>> refused , after the valuable aid they had rendered in the last war , to give them any support against the Boers .::::had
A word would have been sufficient to have kept the latter out of Swaziland , as it had kept them from raiding in Zululand ; but that word was <<target>> given , and the unfortunate people had been raided and plundered , their best land taken from them , and they themselves reduced to a state of semi-subjection .::::not
However , they were glad to see four English sportsmen among them again , and to <<target>> something of the war that had broken out between their oppressors and the British .::::learn
`` If you beat them we shall <<target>> free again , '' they said .::::be
This time you must <<target>> do that .::::not
If you beat them , shoot them all like dogs , or make slaves <<target>> them as they make slaves of the natives who dwell in their land .::::of
Only so will there <<target>> peace . ''::::be
`` I do n't know that the English will do that , '' Chris said ; `` but you may be sure that , when the war is over , the Boers will be <<target>> longer masters , and there will be just law made by us , and all white men and all natives will be protected , and no evil deeds will be allowed . ''::::no
`` Some have been taken by the promises and gifts of the Boers , <<target>> our queen is also , it is said , in their favour .::::and
She is afraid of them , but most of us would take advantage of their fighting you to drive all <<target>> them out of our land , and to win back all the territory they have taken from us .::::of
We are very poor , our best land is gone , we can scarce grow enough food ; and we long for the time when once again we can <<target>> rich mealie patches , and good grazing land for our oxen and our horses , and are again a strong people , and they afraid of us .::::have
Had not the English interfered and taken over the Boer country , we should have wasted it from end to <<target>> ; and they knew it well , and begged your Shepstone to hoist your flag and protect them .::::end
Ah , he should <<target>> stayed there then !::::have
The natives , our friends in the plain , still talk of that happy time when you were masters , and the Boers dared no longer shoot them down as if they were <<target>> beasts and treat them as slaves , and the towns grew up , and your people paid for work with money and not with the lash of a whip or a bullet .::::wild
All of us have mourned over the time when the English bent their knee to the Boers , and gave them all <<target>> wanted , -- the mastery of the land , and the right to kill and enslave us at their will . ''::::they
`` That was not quite <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::so
`` They promised to give good treatment to the natives ; <<target>> was one of the conditions of the treaty . ''::::that
`` And you <<target>> them ! ''::::believed
`` Did you not know that a Boer 's oath is <<target>> good so long as a gun is pointed at him ?::::only
Perhaps it will be like this again , and when you have <<target>> them you will again trust them , and march away .::::conquered
But they tell us , it is not you who <<target>> conquer them , but they who will conquer you .::::will
Runners have brought us news that they have gathered round the place where our people go to work digging bright stones from the ground , and that very soon they will take all the English prisoners , and that they have also beset Mafeking , and that they have <<target>> the English soldiers in Natal , and there will soon be none left there ; and more than that , that the people of the other Boer state have joined them , and have entered the English territory , and are being joined by all the Boers there .::::beaten
Therefore we , who would like to <<target>> against them , are afraid .::::fight
We thought the English a great people ; they had <<target>> the Zulus , and dethroned the great King Cetewayo .::::beaten
But now it seems that the Boers are much <<target>> , and our hearts are sore . ''::::greater
`` You need not fear , <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::chief
`` Our country is very many miles away , many days ' journey <<target>> ships ; it will take weeks before our army gets strong .::::in
The Boers have always said they wanted peace , and we believed them and kept but a few soldiers here , and until the army comes from England they will get the best <<target>> it ; but we can send , if necessary , an army many times stronger than that of the Boers , and are sure to crush them in the end . ''::::of
`` But how could you <<target>> they wanted peace ? ''::::believe
`` Everyone knew that they were building great forts , and had got <<target>> bigger than were ever before seen , and stores full of rifles .::::guns
How could you believe their words when your eyes saw that <<target>> was not peace but war that they meant ? ''::::it
`` Because we were fools , I <<target>> , '' Chris said bitterly .::::suppose
`` It was not from want of warnings , for people living out here had written again and again <<target>> what vast preparations they were making , but the people who govern the country paid no attention .::::telling
It was much easier to believe what was pleasant than what was <<target>> ; but their folly will cost the country very dear .::::unpleasant
We did nothing , and allowed the Boers to complete all <<target>> preparations , and to choose their own time for war .::::their
But though we have made a horrible mistake , do not think , chief , that there is any doubt about our conquering at last ; the men who now govern our country are men and <<target>> cowards , and will not , as that other government did , go on their knees to the Boers , and even if they would do so , the people would not sanction it . ''::::not
`` If what the chief has heard is correct , '' Chris said as they rode <<target>> the next morning , `` we must get back again as soon as we can .::::along
The Boers may be lying , and , of course , <<target>> would make the best of things to the Swazis .::::they
It certainly sounds as if not only at Ladysmith , but <<target>> all other places , things are going badly at present .::::at
However , in another couple of days we <<target>> not be far from the bridge .::::shall
The chief said that the frontier was only a few miles away , and our own men tell <<target>> that it is a very hilly country on the other side , just as it is here .::::us
We have certainly come faster <<target>> we had expected .::::that
Thanks to their good feeding , the <<target>> have all turned out well .::::horses
If it is really only two days farther , we <<target>> get there in just three weeks from starting . ''::::shall
They had not brought the same ponies all the way ; as soon as one showed signs of fatigue , it was changed for another with the arrangement <<target>> , should they return that way , they would take it back and give the chief a present for having seen that it was taken care of .::::that
The four natives , although well contented with the way in which they were fed and cared for , were much puzzled at the <<target>> of their employers to push on , and the disregard they paid to all the information obtained for them of opportunities for sport .::::eagerness
Several times they had said to Jack : `` How <<target>> it the baas does not stop to shoot ?::::is
There are plenty of deer , <<target>> in some places lions .::::and
There are zebras , too , though these are not <<target>> to get at , and very difficult to stalk .::::easy

We can not <<target>> it .::::understand
We have been with white men who came into our country to shoot , or <<target>> see what the land was like , but they did not travel like this .::::to
Besides , we shall soon be in the land of the Boers , and as the <<target>> are at war with them , they will shoot them if they find them . ''::::english
Jack had only been told that his masters were going to strike a blow <<target>> the Boers , and had not troubled himself as to its nature .::::at
He had seen how they had defeated much larger parties <<target>> their own , and had unbounded confidence in them .::::than
`` The baas has <<target>> told me .::::not
I do not think that we need <<target>> that any harm will happen .::::fear
They shoot enough for us to eat heartily , they buy drink for us at every <<target>> they stop at , and if they have seen no game they buy a sheep .::::kraal
What can we <<target>> more ?::::want
They have got you guns , but you have never needed <<target>> use them ; perhaps you may before you get back .::::to
If the Boers meddle with them you <<target>> be able to fight . ''::::will
The prospect of a chance of being allowed to fight against the Boers would alone have inspired the four natives to bear any amount of fatigue <<target>> a murmur , and each day 's march farther north had heightened their hopes that they might use their guns against their old enemies .::::without
It was on the twenty-first day after starting that , from a hill commanding a broad extent of country , <<target>> caught sight of a train of waggons , and knew that their journey was just at an end .::::they
They had debated which side of the Komati river would be the <<target>> to follow , and had agreed to take the eastern bank .::::best
The Boer territory extended a <<target>> miles beyond this .::::few
Komati-poort was close <<target>> the frontier .::::to
As they knew nothing as to the construction of the bridge beyond the fact that it was iron , and were not even sure whether it was entirely on Boer ground , or if the eastern bank of the <<target>> here belonged to the Portuguese , they decided that at any rate it was better to travel as near the frontier as possible , as , were they pursued they could ride at once across the line .::::river
Not that they believed that the Boers would respect this , but they would not know the country so <<target>> as that on their own side , and would not find countrymen to join them in the pursuit .::::well
Keeping down on the eastern side of the hills , they continued until they could see the white line of steam that showed the direction in <<target>> a train from the south-east was coming , and were therefore able to calculate within half a mile where the bridge must be situated .::::which
They camped in a dry donga , and next morning at daybreak left <<target>> horses behind them in charge of the men and walked forward .::::their
A mile farther they obtained <<target>> view of the bridge .::::a
It stood at the point where the river , after running for <<target>> little distance north-west , made a sharp curve to the south .::::some
The bridge stood <<target>> this loop .::::at
If the object had been to render it defensible , it had been admirably chosen by these Boers who laid out the line to the <<target>> frontier , for from the other side of the bank the approach could be swept by cannon and even musketry on both flanks .::::portuguese
Lying down , they took in all the details of the construction through their glasses , and then , choosing their ground so that they could not be <<target>> by any on the bridge , they kept on until they were able to obtain a view from a distance of a quarter of a mile .::::seen
The examination that was now made was <<target>> no means of a satisfactory nature .::::by
Near the bridge there were sidings on <<target>> several lines of loaded trucks stood .::::which
An engine was <<target>> work shunting .::::at
At least a score of natives were at work under the direction of Portuguese , while several men , who were <<target>> their dress evidently Boers , were pointing out to the officials the trucks they desired to be first forwarded .::::by
Three or four of these carried huge cases , two <<target>> them being each long enough to occupy two trucks .::::of
`` There is no doubt those <<target>> guns , '' Chris said .::::are
`` If we can do nothing else , we can work a lot of <<target>> here , which will be some sort of satisfaction after our long ride .::::damage
As to our main object , <<target>> do n't look well . ''::::things
Half a dozen armed Boers could be made out stationed at the Portuguese <<target>> of the bridge , and as many more at the opposite end .::::side
Two lately- erected wooden huts , each of which could give shelter to some fifty men , stood a short distance beyond the bridge , and it was <<target>> by the figures moving about , and a number of horses grazing near , that a strong party was stationed there to furnish guards for the bridge .::::evident
`` I am afraid we can not do it , '' Peters said , after their glasses had all <<target>> fixed on the bridge for several minutes ; `` at least , I do n't see any chance .::::been
`` No , I am <<target>> there is none .::::afraid
If we were to crawl up to them to-night and shoot down all <<target>> this end of the bridge , we should be no nearer .::::at
You see , there are a line of huts on <<target>> side , and two or three better- class houses .::::this
No doubt the railway officials and natives all live there ; they would all turn out when <<target>> heard the firing , and the Boers would come rushing over from the other side .::::they
It would be out of the question for us to carry forward those four boxes to the middle <<target>> the bridge , plant them over the centre of the girders , and light the fuses .::::of
A quarter of an hour would be wanted for the business at the very least , and we should <<target>> have a minute , if there is as good a guard by night as there is by day .::::not
It is likely to be at least as <<target>> , perhaps much more than that .::::large
The thing is impossible <<target>> that way .::::in
However , of course we can crawl up close <<target>> dark and satisfy ourselves about the guard .::::after
`` If it is not to be managed in that way , we must go down to <<target>> river bank and see whether there is anything to be done with one of the piers .::::the
If that is not possible , we must content <<target>> with smashing things up generally on this side .::::ourselves
Several of the trucks look to me to be full of ammunition , <<target>> there are eight with long cases which are no doubt rifles .::::and
We all remember that terrific smash at Johannesburg , and though I do n't say we could do such awful damage as there was there -- for <<target>> were I do n't know how many tons of dynamite exploded then , I think about fifty -- still , it would be a heavy blow .::::there
Any amount of stores would be destroyed , some thousand of rifles , and , for <<target>> I know , all those waggons with tarpaulins over them are full of cartridges .::::aught
However , the bridge <<target>> the principal thing .::::is
We will stop here for an hour or two and examine every foot of the <<target>> , so as to be able to find our way in the dark .::::ground
On returning to their horses <<target>> had a long talk .::::they
Chris was deeply disappointed , but the others , who had never quite believed that his scheme could be carried out , were <<target>> delighted at the knowledge that at any rate they might be able to do an immense deal of damage to the enemy .::::greatly
As soon as it became quite dark , they set out again ; they did <<target>> take their rifles with them , but each had his brace of revolvers .::::not
Before starting , each had wound strips of flannel round <<target>> boots , so that they could run noiselessly .::::his
Brown had in the first place suggested that they should take their boots off , but Chris pointed out that if they had to <<target>> in the dark , one or other of them was sure to lame himself by striking against a stone or other obstacle .::::run
There were several large fires in the shunting yard , and at <<target>> end of the bridge , and at the Boer barracks .::::each
Crawling along on their hands and knees they were completely in the shade , and managed to <<target>> within some twenty or thirty yards of the Boers , who were sitting smoking and talking .::::get
They were all evidently greatly satisfied with news <<target>> they had heard during the day .::::that
Listening to their talk , they gathered something <<target>> what had happened since they left Estcourt .::::of
Colenso had been evacuated by us , an armoured train coming up from Estcourt had been drawn <<target>> the line , and most of the soldiers with it had been killed or captured .::::off
The last news was that the British had sallied out from Estcourt , which was now surrounded , and had attacked the Boers posted in a very <<target>> position near a place called Willow Grange , but had been repulsed , principally by the artillery , with , it was said , immense loss .::::strong
This was not pleasant <<target>> for the listeners .::::hearing
The Boers then had a grumble at being <<target>> so far away from the fighting .::::kept
Then their conversation turned upon a point <<target>> more interesting to the listeners .::::still
A commando had started from Barberton , a border town some <<target>> or forty miles to the west , into Swaziland .::::thirty
A native had mentioned to one of the <<target>> there that four Englishmen had passed north .::::boers
They had stopped at <<target>> chief 's kraal .::::his
They were all quite young , and had <<target>> natives with them , and three pack-horses .::::five
They had come to shoot and see the country , they said ; but they had spoken with one of the men with them , who <<target>> that so far they had not done much hunting , only enough for food ; he supposed that they were going to begin further on .::::said
The Boer had an hour later ridden down to Barberton with the news , and it had been at once resolved to send off a commando of <<target>> hundred men to search the hills , for there was a suspicion that the hunters were British officers who had come up to act as spies .::::a
`` Our cornet had a telegram this afternoon , '' one of them said , `` that <<target>> were to be specially vigilant here , and we must keep a sharp lookout at night .::::we
I do n't suppose they are <<target>> this side of the river .::::on
They may be going to pull up the railway , <<target>> blow up a culvert somewhere between this and Barberton .::::or
Four men with their Kaffirs might do that , <<target>> they certainly could not damage this bridge . ''::::but
At ten o'clock most of the party retired into a small shed a few yards away , but two remained <<target>> by the fire , and were evidently left on guard , for they kept their rifles close at hand .::::sitting
The lads now crawled away some distance , and then <<target>> their way down a steep bank to the river .::::made
It was a stream of some size , running with great rapidity , and it did not take them long to decide that it <<target>> be impossible to swim out with the cases and place these in such a situation that the explosion would damage the structure .::::would
They then moved quietly up to the spot where the end of the last span touched the level ground ; <<target>> rested upon a solid wall built into the rock , and ran some forty feet above their heads .::::it
They were now just under where the Boers were sitting , could <<target>> their voices , and see the glow of their fire .::::hear
They were unable to make out the exact position of the girders , but <<target>> had , when watching it , obtained a general view of the construction .::::they
It consisted of two lines of strong girders on each side , connected <<target>> lattice bars , with strong communications between the sides at each pier .::::by
The depth of the girders <<target>> some twenty feet .::::was
After cautiously feeling the wall and finding that there were no openings in which their explosives could be placed , they crawled away <<target>> , ascended to the bank again a couple of hundred yards from the bridge , and returned to their camping ground .::::noiselessly
They observed as they went that there were still fires burning in the station yard , that some Kaffirs were seated near these , and as , in the silence <<target>> the night , a faint sound could be heard like that of a distant train , they had no doubt that they were waiting up for one to arrive .::::of
Indeed , before they had reached the camping <<target>> they saw a train pass by .::::place
When they reached their tents <<target>> had a long consultation .::::they
No fire had <<target>> lighted .::::been
The horses had been taken some way up a little ravine down which a <<target>> of water trickled ; here the four natives had taken up their post .::::stream
These had only come down in the middle of the day to <<target>> their food , which Jack cooked over the spirit stove .::::fetch
This was alight when the lads returned , but was carefully screened round by <<target>> so that not the slightest glow could be seen from a distance .::::blankets
`` What do you think <<target>> it , Chris ? ''::::of
`` I do n't know <<target>> to think about it .::::what
I have no idea what effect dynamite would have when exploded <<target>> a distance of thirty or forty feet below a bridge .::::at
Certainly it would blow the roadway up , but I have very great doubts whether <<target>> would so twist or smash the main girders as to render the bridge impassable .::::it
The distance to the first pier is not great , and unless one entirely destroyed the bridge , I should say <<target>> it could be repaired very soon -- I mean , in a week or two -- by a strong gang .::::that
If the girders kept their places , two or <<target>> days ' work might patch it up temporarily .::::three
If it were destroyed altogether as far as the first pier , it would stop the cannon getting over till a temporary bridge is constructed ; but by rigging up some strong cables , they could <<target>> cases of musket ammunition across the gap in the same way , you know , as I have seen pictures of shipwrecked people being swung along under a cable in a sort of cradle .::::pass
`` Two hundred pounds of dynamite would <<target>> a lot of damage , Chris .::::do
I should think that it would <<target>> bring the wall down . ''::::certainly
`` I have no doubt that it would do that , Peters , but the <<target>> goes some ten yards farther , and no doubts rests on the solid rock .::::ironwork
I expect the wall is put there more to finish <<target>> thing off than to carry much of the weight .::::the
Well , we will have another look <<target>> the bridge and the waggons to-morrow .::::at
Of course the bridge is the great thing if it can be managed , though I do n't say that <<target>> up the yard would not be a good thing if we ca n't make sure of the other .::::blowing
Anyhow , we need not <<target>> down-hearted about it .::::feel
We came up here on the chance , and even though we may not be able to do <<target>> what we want , we ought to manage to do them a lot of damage . ''::::exactly
After eating their supper they turned <<target>> to their two little tents .::::in
The spirit-lamp had been extinguished , and as they had not the least fear <<target>> discovery , they did not consider it necessary to place a sentinel .::::of
In the morning they were out again early <<target>> at their former post of observation .::::and
`` What are they <<target>> to now ? ''::::up
Brown said an hour later when he saw a party of Boers come <<target>> the opposite side close to the bridge , carrying posts and planks .::::down
Chris made no answer , <<target>> was watching them intently .::::he
They stopped near the bank of <<target>> river close to the bridge .::::the
Then some of them set to work to level a space <<target>> ground , while others made holes at the corners .::::of
`` I am afraid that it is all up with <<target>> plans as far as the bridge is concerned .::::our
They are going to put up a hut there , and I have not the <<target>> doubt it means they are going to station a guard under the bridge .::::least
If they do it that side , they are probably doing <<target>> same on this , only we ca n't see them .::::the
The Boers are stupid enough in some things , but they are sharp enough in others , and it is possible that the commando from Barberton has come upon one of the kraals where we <<target>> , and asking a lot of questions about us , they have found out that we had four heavy boxes with us , and the idea may have struck them that these contained explosives .::::slept
If that did occur to them , it is almost certain that a man has been sent off at once to <<target>> with orders to telegraph here and to other bridges , to take every precaution against their being blown up .::::barberton
After three hours ' work the hut was completed , and <<target>> party of eight men brought down blankets and other kit .::::a
Two of these at once ascended the bank with their <<target>> and sat down at the foot of the wall .::::rifles
`` However , I will creep round to a point where <<target>> can get a view of this side of the bridge .::::i
He crawled away among the rocks , <<target>> rejoined his companions an hour later .::::and
`` It is just <<target>> same this side .::::the
They have settled the <<target>> for us .::::question
Now we will give our <<target>> to the waggons . ''::::attention
Having given up all hopes of blowing up the bridge , Chris <<target>> his comrades turned their whole attention to the lines of waggons .::::and
The train that had come in on the previous evening had added to the <<target>> , although it had taken some of them away with it up country .::::number
They now made out that there were eight waggons piled with cases , that almost certainly contained rifles ; six with tarpaulins closely packed over them , and these they guessed contained <<target>> boxes ; four , each with two large cases that might contain field guns ; while the two with what they were sure were big guns still remained on the siding .::::ammunition
`` I should say that about four or five pounds of dynamite would be an abundance for each of those ammunition waggons ; less than that would do , <<target>> we could , by slitting the tarpaulins , put a pound among the cases , and if one case were exploded it would set all the others off .::::as
There is no <<target>> about them .::::trouble
I will just <<target>> a note .::::take
They are on the second siding ; there are eight other waggons in front of <<target>> and six behind , so we can not make any mistake about that .::::them
There must be a good heavy charge under the rifle trucks , for we shall have to <<target>> them all well into the air to bend and damage them enough to be altogether unserviceable .::::blow
As for the guns , and especially the <<target>> ones , it is a difficult question .::::heavy
Of course , if we could open the cases and get at the breech-pieces , and put dynamite among them , we could damage all the mechanism so much that the guns would be useless until new breech-pieces were made , which I fancy <<target>> be altogether beyond the Boers ; but as there is no possibility of opening them , we must trust to blowing the guns so high in the air that they will be too much damaged for use by the explosion and fall .::::must
We have got altogether two hundredweight ; now two <<target>> to each ammunition waggon will take twelve pounds .::::pounds
What shall we say <<target>> the rifles ? ''::::for
`` We must have a good <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::charge
`` Suppose we say nine pounds to each , that will save eight pounds ; fifteen pounds apiece ought to give the eight cases which <<target>> suppose hold field-guns a good hoist ; that will leave us with over a hundred pounds , fifty for each of the big guns .::::we
Now that we have seen all that is necessary , we <<target>> as well be off and begin to get ready . ''::::may
The covers were taken off the boxes of dynamite , and these were unscrewed , <<target>> the explosive was with great care divided into the portions as agreed upon .::::and
Two of the cases furnished just sufficient for the ammunition waggons and the two big <<target>> , the other two for the smaller cannon and the trucks with the rifles .::::guns
The charges were sewn up in pieces of the canvas , the smaller charges for the ammunition boxes being enclosed in thinner <<target>> that had been sewn under the canvas used in packing ; the fuses and detonators were then cut and inserted .::::stuff
Chris was perfectly up in this work , having <<target>> the operation scores of times in the mines .::::performed
The length it should burn was <<target>> decided after a discussion .::::only
There would be in all nineteen charges to explode , and these were in three groups <<target>> some little distance from each other , all the cannon being on the same siding .::::at
It would be necessary , perhaps , to wait for some time till all these were free from observation by natives <<target>> others who might be moving about the yard , then a signal must be given that they could all see .::::or
It would not take long to light the fuses , for each of them would be provided with a slow match , which burns <<target>> but a spark , and could be held under a hat or an inverted tin cup till the time came for using it .::::with
The question was how far must they be away to ensure their own safety , and Chris maintained that at least four or five <<target>> yards would be necessary to place them in even comparative safety from the rain of fragments that would fall over a wide area .::::hundred
Finally it was agreed to cut the fuses to a length to burn four minutes ; this would <<target>> a minute for any hitch that might occur in lighting them , and three minutes to burn .::::allow
It was of course important that they should be no longer than was absolutely necessary , as there existed a certain risk that one of the <<target>> sparks might be seen by a passing Kaffir , or , as was still more probable , the smell of burning powder should attract attention .::::little
It was agreed that Chris should light the fuses at the cannon , which were farthest from the others , that Peters should see to the <<target>> rifle trucks , and Willesden and Brown attend the eight trucks with the ammunition , one to begin at each end of the line .::::six
When each had finished his work , he was to run straight away in the direction of the encampment , <<target>> all were to throw themselves down when they felt sure that the time for the explosions had arrived .::::and
As soon as all was over they were <<target>> meet at their place of encampment .::::to
Tents and all stores were to be removed before the work began to the ravine where the horses were , the men with them being <<target>> to stand at the animals ' heads , as there would be a great explosion , and the horses might break loose and stampede .::::charged
The matter that puzzled them the most was how , when they reached their respective stations -- separated from each other by lines of waggons , and <<target>> some cases by distances of a couple of hundred yards -- they were to know when the work of lighting the fuses was to begin .::::in
It could not be done by sound , for this would reach the <<target>> of any awake in the yard or the sentries at the bridge .::::ears
Chris at last <<target>> a plan .::::suggested
`` When we start , Jack shall be stationed at a point on the <<target>> high enough for us to see him from all points of the yard .::::hillside
We will show him the exact <<target>> while it is light .::::spot
When we start he shall go down with us to the edge of the yard , <<target>> as we separate will turn and go up to the point we had shown him .::::and
He will be ordered to walk up quietly , and not to hurry ; that <<target>> give us ample time to get to our stations before he reaches his .::::will
We must all keep our <<target>> fixed on that point .::::eyes
He will take the dark lantern with him ; when he gets there he must turn <<target>> shade off , so as to show the light for a quarter of a minute .::::the
That will be our <<target>> to begin .::::signal
It is most unlikely that anyone else will see it , but even if <<target>> did they would simply stare in that direction and wonder what it was .::::they
Of course , only a flash would be safer ; but some of us might not <<target>> it , and would remain waiting for it until the other explosions took place . ''::::see
All agreed that this would <<target>> a very good plan .::::be
Chris crawled up with Jack until he reached a spot where he commanded a perfect <<target>> of the yard , and explained to him exactly what he was to do .::::view
He had already been told what <<target>> going to take place .::::was
Knowing that the Kaffirs have very little idea of time , he said : `` You will hold it open while you say <<target>> like this , ' I am showing the light , baas , and I hope that you can all see it . '::::slowly
You will say that over twice and then turn off the light , <<target>> lie down under that big rock till you hear the explosion .::::and
Wait a little , for stones <<target>> fragments will come tumbling down .::::and
When they have stopped doing so make your way straight to where <<target>> horses are ; you will find us there before you .::::the
Now , repeat over to me the words <<target>> are to say slowly twice . ''::::you
Jack did so , and finding on questioning him that he perfectly understood what he was to do , Chris <<target>> back with him to the encampment , where they remained quietly until the sun set and darkness came on .::::went
Then , according to arrangement , the four natives came in and carried all the things back to <<target>> ravine , and laid them down ready to pack the horses as soon as their masters returned .::::the
The day passed slowly <<target>> the lads .::::to
All were in a state of suppressed excitement , an excitement vastly <<target>> than they had felt during their two fights with the Boers .::::greater
`` How they will wonder who did it when <<target>> hear the news down in Natal ! ''::::they
`` I do n't expect they will hear <<target>> about it , '' Chris said .::::much
`` You may be sure the Boers will not say much ; they make a big brag <<target>> every success , but they wo n't care to publish such a thing as this .::::over
Probably their papers will only say : 'An explosion of <<target>> trifling nature occurred on the Portuguese side of Komati-poort .::::a
Some barrels of powder exploded ; it is unknown whether it <<target>> the result of accident or the work of spies .::::was
Due precaution will be taken to <<target>> the recurrence of the accident .::::prevent
`` I suppose that will <<target>> about it , Chris .::::be
However , I have no doubt that that commando from Barberton will <<target>> a very sharp look-out for us as we go back . ''::::keep
`` Yes , but they <<target>> n't catch us .::::wo
We wo n't venture into Swaziland again , but will make our way down on <<target>> Portuguese side , following the railway till we are fairly beyond the mountain range .::::the
We can ride fast now that we <<target>> got rid of the dynamite .::::have
I really think that our best way will <<target>> to ride straight down to Lorenzo Marques .::::be
When we get there we can very well state that we had been ordered to leave Johannesburg , and <<target>> , as the trains are so slow and so crowded with fugitives , we had ridden down .::::that
I do n't suppose that we shall attract the least notice , for we know <<target>> a great many of those who had intended to stay have been ordered off .::::that
That way we shall get back to Natal in <<target>> few days and avoid all danger . ''::::a
The others agreed that this would be a capital plan ; and the distance by the road , which they had crossed a few miles to <<target>> south , and which runs from Lorenzo Marques up to Ladysdorp and the Murchison and Klein Lemba gold-fields , would not be above seventy miles .::::the
They would wait till daybreak showed them the amount of damage that had been done , and then start , and would be down at Lorenzo Marques in the evening , when , even <<target>> the news of the explosion reached the town , the Boers ' suspicions that some Englishmen were in the hills , and that it was probably their work , would not be known .::::if
Not until ten o'clock <<target>> a move made .::::was
Then they took up the packages of dynamite , and , accompanied <<target>> Jack , made their way noiselessly down to the railway yard .::::by
Chris , aided by Jack , carried the big packets <<target>> the large guns and for the eight smaller ones .::::for
In a minute or two they <<target>> joined by the others .::::were
Peters had placed his parcels under the eight trucks with rifles ; Willesden and Brown had cut holes <<target>> the tarpaulins of the ammunition trucks , and thrust down their charges well among the boxes .::::in
While the others stood closely round him Jack opened the lantern <<target>> widely enough for them to light their slow matches .::::just
`` Now , you are not to hurry back to the place , Jack ; <<target>> shall all be on the look-out for you by the time you get there .::::we
You know your instructions ; you are to turn round , open the slide of the lantern , say the words <<target>> told you over twice slowly , then shut the lantern and get under that great boulder lying against the rock .::::i
You will be perfectly <<target>> in there . ''::::safe
The others hurried to their respective posts , and then turned round <<target>> gazed at the spot where the light would be shown .::::and
In their anxiety and excitement the time seemed interminable , and each began to think that the native <<target>> somehow blundered ; at last the light appeared , and they turned at once to their work .::::had
Knowing that they were sure to be confused as to the time , they had calculated before the sun had set how far they <<target>> run in three minutes , which should be , if all went well , the time they would have after leaving the yard .::::could
They thought that even on the rough ground , and in the dark , they could make a hundred and fifty yards a minute , and at <<target>> four hundred and fifty from the waggons there was a low ridge of rock behind which they would obtain protection from all fragments blown directly outwards .::::about
Chris was the first to arrive , for the trucks with the cannon were those farthest away from the bridge , and he was able to run for <<target>> distance along the line before making for the elope , and therefore travelled faster than his companions , who had farther to run on broken ground .::::some
In half a minute they <<target>> up almost together .::::rushed
Twenty seconds later there was a tremendous roar and a <<target>> crash , and they felt the ground shake .::::blinding
Several fell close to where the lads were crouched <<target>> the rock , but none touched them .::::against
There was no doubt that the success of the attempt was complete , and the lads walked back quietly until <<target>> were at the spot where the horses had been placed , Jack overtaking them just as they reached it .::::they
`` Jack thought his <<target>> was gone .::::life
Things fell on the rock but <<target>> not break it . ''::::could
`` Nothing short of one of those big <<target>> would have done that , Jack .::::cannon
Well , we shall see in the <<target>> what damage is done . ''::::morning
The four natives , although they had <<target>> warned , were still terribly frightened .::::been
The horses had at the first crash broken away and run up the ravine , <<target>> they had just brought them down again , still trembling and lathering with fear .::::but
For some minutes the boys patted and soothed them , and accustomed to their voices and <<target>> they gradually quieted down , but were very restless until day began to break .::::caresses
The boys had no <<target>> of sleep .::::thought
The lamp was lit and tea made , and each of the Kaffirs was given a glass of spirits and water , for they had brought up a bottle <<target>> them in case of illness or any special need ; and it was evident from their chattering teeth and broken speech that the natives needed a stimulant badly .::::with
Before it became light the horses were saddled , and the five <<target>> told to take them along the hill a mile farther .::::natives
When they had seen them off the lads <<target>> to their former post above the station .::::returned
They had several times , when they looked out during the night , seen a great light <<target>> that direction , and had no doubt that some of the fallen huts had caught fire .::::in
Prepared as they were for a scene of <<target>> , the reality far exceeded their expectations .::::destruction
All the waggons within a considerable distance of the explosions were <<target>> into fragments , their wheels broken and the axles twisted .::::smashed
The ammunition trucks had disappeared , and many <<target>> to them had been completely shattered .::::close
Those in which the muskets had been were a mere heap of fragments ; the rest <<target>> the trucks lay , some with their sides blown in , others comparatively uninjured .::::of
Some were piled on the top of others three or four <<target>> ; their contents were scattered over the whole yard .::::deep
Boxes and cases were burst open , and their contents -- including large quantities of <<target>> , sugar , tinned provisions in vast quantities , and other stores -- ruined .::::tea
Some still smoking brands showed where the huts had stood , and the dead bodies <<target>> some twenty natives and several Portuguese officials , were scattered here and there .::::of
A huge cannon stood upright nearly <<target>> the centre of the yard .::::in
It had fallen on its muzzle , which <<target>> penetrated some feet into the earth .::::had
They could not see where <<target>> fellow had fallen .::::its
Five others , which looked like fifteen-pounders , were lying <<target>> different directions , the other three had disappeared .::::in
Rifles twisted , bent , and <<target>> were lying about everywhere .::::ruined
`` It is not as good as the bridge , '' Chris said after they had used their glasses for some time in silence , `` but <<target>> is a heavy blow for them , and I should think it will be a week before the line can be cleared ready for traffic .::::it
Even when they begin they will feel <<target>> loss of so much rolling-stock .::::the
There were five engines <<target>> the yard .::::in
Every one of these has been upset , and will want <<target>> lot of repairs before it is fit for anything again .::::a
Well , we may <<target>> well be moving .::::as
The Boers look as if they were stupefied at present , but they will be <<target>> up presently , and the sooner we start for Lorenzo Marques the better . ''::::waking
Half an hour later they had mounted and were on their way , travelling <<target>> till they came upon the road , and then at a fast pace .::::slowly
Jack rode the spare horse , the other natives rode the ponies in turn , <<target>> on foot keeping up without difficulty by laying a hand on the saddles .::::those
Sometimes they trotted for two or three miles , and then went at a walk for half an hour , and stopped altogether for four hours <<target>> the heat of the day , for they were now getting on to low land , being only some three hundred feet above the sea .::::in
In the morning they sold the two ponies , and were fortunate <<target>> finding a steamer lying there that would start the next day .::::in
Being very unwilling to part with their horses they arranged for deck passages for them , <<target>> their own risk of injury to them in case of rough weather setting in .::::taking
Every berth was already engaged , but this mattered little to them , <<target>> they could sleep upon the planks as well as on the ground .::::as
They found that there was some excitement in the town , as there was <<target>> report that there had been an explosion and much damage done near Komati-poort .::::a
No particulars were , however , known , as the <<target>> officials maintained a strict silence as to the affair .::::railway
It was known , however , that the telegraphic communication with the Transvaal was broken , and that three trains filled with <<target>> labourers , and accompanied by a number of officials and a company of soldiers , had gone up early that morning .::::kaffir
This , however , seemed <<target>> in the extreme .::::unlikely
Fortunately the weather was fine on the run down to Durban , <<target>> the passage of three hundred miles was effected in twenty-four hours .::::and
It was now just a month since they had left Maritzburg , and as soon as they <<target>> with their horses and followers they learned that much had taken place during that time .::::landed
They had started on <<target>> 10th of November .::::the
The Boers were then steadily advancing , and so great did the danger appear , <<target>> Durban had been strongly fortified by the blue jackets , aided by Kaffir labour .::::that
On the 25th Sir Redvers Buller had arrived , and <<target>> this time a considerable force was gathered at Estcourt .::::by
The British advance began from that <<target>> on the following day .::::town
The place had been entirely cut off , Boers occupying <<target>> whole country as far as the Mooi river .::::the
General Hildyard , who commanded at Estcourt , had been obliged to inarch out several times to keep them at a distance from <<target>> town , and one or two sharp artillery engagements had taken place , the Boers being commanded by General Joubert in person .::::the
They had always retired a short distance , but their movements were so rapid that it <<target>> useless to follow ; and the troops had each time fallen back to Estcourt .::::was
On the 28th the Boers had blown up the bridge across the Tugela , <<target>> our army was moving forward , and a great battle was expected shortly .::::and
Riding then to the railway , he found that the line was closed altogether to passenger traffic , <<target>> that a train with some troops and a strong detachment of sailors was going up that evening .::::but
Learning that a naval officer was in command , as the military consisted only of small parties of men who had <<target>> left behind , when their regiments left , to look after and forward their stores , he went to him .::::been
`` What can I do <<target>> you , sir ? ''::::for
the officer , who was watching a <<target>> loading trucks with sheep , asked .::::party
`` My name is <<target>> , sir .::::king
I have just returned from an expedition to Komati , I and three friends with me , and we have succeeded in blowing up a large number of waggons containing a battery of field <<target>> , two very heavy long guns , which , by the marks on the case , came from Creusot , some eight or ten thousand rifles , and six truck-loads of ammunition .

`` The deuce <<target>> have ! ''::::you
the officer said , looking with great surprise at <<target>> lad who told him this astonishing tale .::::the
Then sharply he added : `` Are <<target>> speaking the truth , sir ?::::you
You will find it the worse for <<target>> if you are not . ''::::you
`` What I say is perfectly <<target>> , '' Chris said quietly .::::true
`` We only arrived an <<target>> since from Lorenzo Marques .::::hour
This open letter from General Yule will show you that the party of boys of <<target>> I was the leader , have done some good service before now . ''::::whom
The officer opened and <<target>> the letter .::::read
`` After adventuring into a Boer camp , and giving so heavy a lesson to a superior force of <<target>> enemy , I can quite imagine you capable of carrying out the adventure you have just spoken of .::::the
Now , sir , what can <<target>> do for you ? ''::::i
`` I have come to ask if you will allow <<target>> and my three friends to accompany you . ''::::myself
`` That I <<target>> most certainly .::::will
And indeed , as you have a report to make of this matter to General <<target>> , you have a right to go on by the first military train .::::buller

`` I will go with you to <<target>> , '' the officer said .::::him
`` I ca n't say whether that <<target>> be managed or not . ''::::can
The station-master at first said that it was impossible , for his orders were for a certain number of <<target>> and trucks , and with those orders from the commanding officer he could not add to the number .::::carriages
`` There are four gentlemen going up with a <<target>> important report to Sir Redvers Buller . ''::::very
`` I would do it willingly enough , '' the station-master said , `` but the commanding officer <<target>> bound to be down here with his staff , and he would notice the horses directly . ''::::is
`` They might be put in a closed <<target>> , sir , '' Chris urged .::::van
`` And as there are so many full of stores , it <<target>> naturally be supposed that this was also loaded with them . ''::::would

It was now half-past five , and Chris joined his friends , <<target>> were waiting with the horses and Kaffirs near the station .::::who
They had hardly expected him so soon , as <<target>> did not know that his mother had left .::::they
We still have our water-skins ; the Kaffirs had better get them filled at once , and a good <<target>> of mealies for the horses on the way ; there is no saying how long we may be .::::supply
Willesden , do you run into a store and get a supply of bread and a cold ham for ourselves ; a good stock of bread for the Kaffirs , <<target>> a jar of water , and a hamper , with a lock , containing two dozen bottles of beer , the mildest you can get , for them .::::and
We are sure to get out for a few minutes at one of the <<target>> , and can then unlock the hamper and give them a bottle each .::::stations
It would never do to leave it to their mercy ; they would drink <<target>> up in the first half-hour , and then likely enough quarrel and fight .::::it
For ourselves , we will have a small skin of <<target>> and , say , three bottles of whisky .::::water
The carriage is sure to be full , and it <<target>> be acceptable in the heat of the day tomorrow .::::will
The remainder of our supply of tea and so on , and the lamp and other things , had better all go in <<target>> the horses , and everything we do not absolutely want in the train with us ; there will be little room enough .::::with
Get an extra kettle , then we can not only make ourselves a cup of tea or cocoa on the road , but give <<target>> to any friend we may make ; besides , it is sure to come in useful when we get to the front . ''::::some
`` I will see <<target>> all that . ''::::to
`` If you will , take Jack with <<target>> to carry the things you buy . ''::::you
That work , however , turned out <<target>> easy than he had expected .::::more
The station-master pointed out the waggon that he was to take , <<target>> was standing alone on one of the lines of rails .::::which
They all set to work , and were not long in running it alongside an empty platform , from which the horses were led <<target>> it without trouble , being by this time accustomed to so many changes that they obeyed their masters ' orders without hesitation .::::into
The station-master happened to catch sight of them , and sent two of the porters to take <<target>> waggon across the various points to the rear of the train , where it was coupled .::::the
The shutter was closed , and the Kaffirs told that on no account were they <<target>> open it or show their faces until the train had left the station .::::to
In a few minutes Willesden came up <<target>> the two natives heavily laden .::::with
As soon as the stores and natives were all safely packed away and the door of the van locked by <<target>> of the porters , the lads went out and had a hearty meal at an hotel near the station .::::one
When they returned a large number of soldiers <<target>> sailors were gathered on the platform .::::and
The naval men were in the front part of the train , and <<target>> Chris walking up there the officer in command beckoned to him .::::on
`` I will take you in the <<target>> with me , Mr. King .::::carriage

Your three companions will go in the next two compartments , which will contain junior <<target>> and midshipmen , and I am sure that they too will be very welcome .::::officers
Before we board the train I will get you all to <<target>> and sit at the windows at the other side .::::go
If you will bring your friends up I will <<target>> them to their messmates on the trip .::::introduce
As soon as we have all entered , we shall be at the window <<target>> good-by to our friends , and no one will catch sight of you .::::saying
It is just as well , for although I feel perfectly justified in taking you on to make your report to the commander-in-chief , my <<target>> might fuss over it ; and although he might let you go on , there would be a lot of explanations and bother .::::senior
Have you got your <<target>> in ? ''::::horses
`` Yes , sir ; we were <<target>> to manage that capitally . ''::::able
Chris brought up his three friends and introduced them to the <<target>> , who then took them to the group of youngsters .::::officer
`` Gentlemen , '' he said , `` <<target>> three gentlemen will travel in your compartment .::::these
They have seen a great deal of the war , <<target>> belong to one of the mounted volunteer corps .::::and
They have a wonderful story to tell you , and <<target>> am sure you will be delighted with their companionship .::::i
They will take their seats <<target>> before the men entrain .::::just
They must occupy the seats near the farther window , and as you will no doubt all be looking out on this side , they <<target>> probably not be noticed , which would be all the better , as it is a little irregular my taking them up . ''::::will
By this time a considerable number of people were crowded in the station , friends of the officers and comrades of the <<target>> , who looked enviously at those going forward , while they themselves might possibly not get a chance of doing so .::::sailors
A quarter of an hour <<target>> the officer said :::::later
`` I am going to <<target>> the order to entrain .::::give
You and your friends had better slip <<target>> your places at once . ''::::into
As soon as they had got in the order was given , and <<target>> the regularity of a machine the three hundred men entered the train .::::with
As soon as they had done <<target>> the officers took their places .::::so
The crowd moved up on to the platform , and there was much <<target>> of hands , cheering , and exhortations to do for the Boers .::::shaking
Suddenly there was a backward movement on the part of the spectators , and the commanding naval officer on <<target>> station , with several others and a group of military men , came on to the platform .::::the
They were received by the officers in command of the sailors <<target>> soldiers , and walked with them along the platform talking .::::and
This was evidently a <<target>> of ceremony only .::::matter
The usual questions were put as to the stores , and after standing and chatting for eight or ten minutes the officers took their places in the <<target>> , the engine whistled , and the train moved on , amid loud cheering both from those on the platform and the men at the windows .::::train
As soon as they were fairly <<target>> , Chris 's friend said :::::off
I can only say , gentlemen , that this young officer is in command of a section of <<target>> Horse , and has done work that any of us might be proud indeed to accomplish .::::volunteer
While the letter was being passed round from hand to hand , a good deal to Chris 's <<target>> , he had time to look more closely than he had done before at his travelling companions .::::discomfort
Three of them were young lieutenants , the fourth <<target>> older man , shrewd but kindly faced .::::an
I hope that you will have no <<target>> to make his professional acquaintance . ''::::occasion
When they had all read the letter , the senior lieutenant said : `` Now , Mr. King , <<target>> wo n't ask much of you to-night ; we shall have all to-morrow to listen to your story .::::we
We have all had a pretty hard day 's <<target>> , and shall before long turn in .::::work

`` There are twenty-one of us , sir , <<target>> we are all about the same age .::::and
We were great friends together at Johannesburg , where our <<target>> were for the most part connected with mining .::::fathers
As things went on badly , we decided to form <<target>> into a corps if the war broke out .::::ourselves
They chose me as their leader -- for no particular reason that I know of -- and with the understanding <<target>> if I did not quite give satisfaction , I should resign in favour of one of the others .::::that
We had all obtained our parents ' consent , and when we <<target>> to Pietermaritzburg , proceeded to get our horses and equipments .::::got
`` We want to know what steps you <<target>> , and how you managed it .::::took
Did you come down all <<target>> way by train ? ''::::the
`` That is a good point to <<target>> off , '' the officer said .::::leave
`` Tomorrow morning we will take your story in instalments , and I <<target>> hope you will give us the details as minutely as you can .::::do
They will greatly interest us , as we are going in for that sort of thing , and it will show us what can be done by a small <<target>> of young fellows accustomed to the country , well- mounted , and , I am sure , from what General Yule says , remarkably well led . ''::::number
The other three lads did not get off so easily , the younger officers were all so delighted at the prospect of soon being engaged that they were in no way inclined <<target>> sleep , and it was not until the seniors had long been soundly off that they too agreed to postpone the rest of the boys ' narrative until the next morning .::::to
The train travelled very slowly , and Pietermaritzburg -- a distance <<target>> seventy miles -- was not reached until day was breaking .::::of
Here there was a long pause , <<target>> all alighted to stretch their limbs .::::and
The lads ran to the end of <<target>> train ; Jack was looking out .::::the
`` I thought that we should stop here , baas , '' he <<target>> ; `` and I have got the kettles boiling and ready . ''::::said
`` How have the horses <<target>> the night ? ''::::passed
`` They have been very <<target>> , baas . ''::::quiet
`` That is <<target>> to know .::::good

`` Yes , <<target>> . ''::::baas

We will start breakfast first in my compartment , Willesden ; we <<target>> pass you in the ham when we have done with it .::::will
Open a couple of tins of milk , Jack , and then <<target>> can bring them along when you have taken the kettles .::::you
There is no extraordinary hurry , for I heard them say <<target>> we should wait here at least an hour . ''::::that
There was some amusement among the soldiers and sailors as Jack , carrying the kettles , and Chris , Willesden , Brown , and Peters <<target>> ham , bread and butter , tin mugs , plates , and three open tins of preserved milk , came along down the platform .::::with
`` What have you <<target>> here ? ''::::got
the doctor asked in surprise , <<target>> they arrived at the carriage .::::as
`` It is in the rough , but you will get <<target>> rougher than this before you get to Ladysmith . ''::::it
`` Why , you <<target>> be a conjurer .::::must
Where did you get <<target>> water from ?::::the
We were just discussing whether we should go out and try to fight our way to those barrels of beer where the <<target>> are clustered , or content ourselves with spirit and water , a drink I can not recommend in the morning . ''::::tommies
There were exclamations of pleasure from all in the <<target>> as Jack was handing in the things .::::carriage
`` We provided ourselves with a great basket of eatables and a few bottles of wine , but the <<target>> of making tea in the train did not , I think , occur to any of us . ''::::idea
By the time that the first mugs were empty Jack arrived with the fresh supply , and long before <<target>> train started breakfast was over , pipes had been lighted , and all felt thoroughly awake and cheery .::::the
`` Do you always travel <<target>> well provided , Mr .::::so
In case we ca n't find wood for a fire , it <<target>> all the difference in the world in our comfort . ''::::makes
`` Now , Mr. King , we must waste no more time ; so please <<target>> at once , or there will be no time to hear all your story .::::begin
Tell us something about <<target>> expedition to Komati-poort .::::your
The other we shall hope to hear on another occasion in our camp , <<target>> we shall all be glad to see you at any time . ''::::where
Chris then related the idea he had formed at Maritzburg , of blowing <<target>> the bridge , and how he had carried out the adventure .::::up
He passed very briefly over the journey , but described fully how they had been obliged to relinquish their original project , owing to the bridge being so strongly guarded at both ends ; and how , failing in that respect , they had <<target>> to do as much damage as possible to the great assemblage of waggons filled with arms and military stores ; and fully detailed the manner in which this had been accomplished , and the aspect of the yard on the following morning .::::determined
`` Splendidly planned and <<target>> out ! ''::::carried
the commander of the party exclaimed , <<target>> the others all echoed his words .::::and
It was astonishing indeed to think that such a plan should have been conceived and carried out by a lad <<target>> older than some of their junior midshipmen , and assisted by only three others of the same age .::::no
`` The day before we started , '' the doctor said , `` I saw in one of the Durban papers a telegram from Lorenzo Marques saying that there had been an explosion at Komati-poort , where a <<target>> waggons had been injured and two natives killed , but that the Boers had suffered in any way , and that the damage would be repaired and the line opened for traffic in a few hours . ''::::few
I am convinced that is strictly true , for the eight Boers at the bridge were certainly instantaneously killed ; and of the <<target>> , whom I am sorry for , there were certainly eighteen killed , together with some eight or ten Portuguese employÃ©s .::::natives
If I could by any possibility have got the natives <<target>> of the way I would have done so .::::out
As to the Portuguese I do not feel any great regret , for I believe all the officials in the custom-house on the railway are bribed by the Boers <<target>> break the official orders they receive as to observing strict neutrality , and aid in every way in passing the materials of war into the Transvaal . ''::::to
There was no time for further conversation , for they were now within a short distance of the Tugela , and <<target>> train was winding its way between steep hills which could have been held successfully by a handful of men .::::the
`` The only wonder to me is , '' another officer said , `` that the Boers <<target>> not take up and drag away the rails all the way from here to Estcourt .::::did
If they had lifted them out of their sleepers , they had only <<target>> harness a rail behind each horse and trot off with it .::::to
I know that there is a considerable amount of railway material at Durban , but <<target>> doubt if there is anything like sufficient to make twenty miles of road .::::i
And the business would have been still more difficult if the <<target>> had collected the sleepers in great piles and burned them .::::boers
Of course they have destroyed a good <<target>> culverts and the bridge at Estcourt .::::many
It is wonderful that the railway people should have managed to get up a temporary trestle bridge <<target>> soon , and to make a deviation of the line to carry the trains over .::::so
It does their <<target>> immense credit .::::engineers
This pass is widening , '' he added <<target>> putting his head out of the window .::::after
`` I fancy we shall be at <<target>> in a few minutes . ''::::chieveley
A number of sailors were unloading shells for their guns , and a crowd of <<target>> , under the orders of military officers , were getting out the stores .::::kaffirs
As they alighted , after hearty thanks to the officer whose kindness had been the means of their getting forward so promptly , and who now went <<target>> report his arrival to Captain Jones , who was superintending the operations of the sailors , Chris and his party hurried to the rear waggon .::::to
It was a work of considerable difficulty to get the horses out , and could <<target>> have been accomplished had there not been a stack of sleepers near the spot .::::not
A number of these were carried and piled so as to make <<target>> sloping gangway , by which the horses were brought down .::::a
The next day the big naval guns had opened fire ; but although their shell had reached the lower entrenchments of the Boers , their batteries on the hill <<target>> proved to be beyond their range even with the greatest elevation that could be given to them , while the Boer guns carried far beyond the camp .::::had
Chris had learned at Estcourt , where the train stopped a few minutes , that Captain Brookfield 's troop formed <<target>> of the Colonial Horse that had advanced with General Barton 's brigade , and they soon discovered their position .::::part
I had , of course , given you leave to act on your own <<target>> , but I never dreamt of your undertaking an expedition of that sort .::::responsibility
Of course you found it <<target>> to get there .::::impossible
A lad told me that you had reckoned on being away six or seven weeks , and <<target>> is less than a month since the date on which he told me you left .::::it
Anyhow , I heartily congratulate you <<target>> all getting back . ''::::on
`` We got there , sir , but nothing could be <<target>> with the bridge , it was so safely guarded .::::done
However , we did blow up two big cannon and a battery of small <<target>> , some ten thousand rifles , and an enormous quantity of ammunition . ''::::ones
`` You do n't <<target>> so , Chris ?::::say
Then you had better <<target>> than you deserved .::::luck
One of the correspondents told me this morning that there was news in the town by a telegram from Lorenzo <<target>> that there had been an accidental explosion at Komati-poort , but it did not seem to be anything serious .::::marques

`` I congratulate you most heartily , '' he <<target>> , when Chris had finished the story .::::said
`` Of course you have written <<target>> report of it ? ''::::a
`` Here it <<target>> , sir .::::is
I have made it very brief , merely saying that I had the honour to report that , with Messrs. Peters , Brown , and Willesden , I succeeded in blowing up , with two hundredweight of dynamite , <<target>> things I have mentioned to you , destroying a large quantity of rolling stock , badly damaging five locomotives , and destroying roads and sidings to such an extent that traffic can hardly be resumed for a fortnight .::::the
`` No , but he <<target>> be here this afternoon .::::will
Now , I will not <<target>> you from your friends .::::detain
No doubt they saw you ride in , and <<target>> be most anxious to hear of your doings .::::will
You will hardly <<target>> them again .::::know
When they came up to join us they adopted the uniform of the corps , <<target>> that it would be uncomfortable going about in a large camp in civilian dress .::::feeling
They brought with them uniforms for you all , for <<target>> seemed very certain that you would return alive . ''::::they
`` I am very glad of that , sir , for <<target>> soldiers all stared at us as we came up here .::::the
I suppose they took us for sight-seers who <<target>> come up to witness the battle . ''::::had
As they left the tent they found the rest of their party , gathered <<target>> a group twenty yards away , and the heartiest greeting was exchanged .::::in
The delight of the party knew no bounds when they found <<target>> their four friends had not had their journey in vain .::::that
They had two tents between them , and gathering in one of them they listened to Peters , who told <<target>> story , as Chris said he had told it twice , and should probably have to tell it again .::::the
The four lads at once exchanged their civilian clothes <<target>> the uniforms that had been brought up .::::for
The first step when they were dressed was to mount an eminence some distance in <<target>> of the camp , whence they had a view of the whole country .::::rear
In front of them was a wide valley <<target>> a broad river running through it .::::with
It was crossed by two bridges , that of the railway , which had been blown up and destroyed , and the road bridge , <<target>> was still intact ; though , as Sankey , who had accompanied them , told them , it was known to be mined .::::which
To the left of the line of railway was a hill known as Grobler 's <<target>> , on the summit of which a line of heavy guns could be seen .::::kloof
There was another battery behind this , and others <<target>> farther to the right on Mount Hlangwane .::::still
Heavy guns could be seen on other hills to the left of Grobler 's Kloof ; while far away behind Colenso was the crest of Mount <<target>> , from which a cannonade was being directed upon Ladysmith and an occasional white burst of smoke showed that the garrison were replying successfully .::::bulwana
On all the lower slopes of the hills were lines , <<target>> broken , sometimes connected , rising one above another .::::sometimes
These were the Boer entrenchments , and Cairns said that he heard that <<target>> extended for nearly twenty miles both to the right and left .::::they
`` It is believed that we do n't see anything like all of them , '' he went on , `` but we really do n't know much about them , for <<target>> Boers only answer occasionally from their great guns on the hilltops , and although yesterday the sailors fired lyddite shells at these lower trenches , there was no reply . ''::::the
`` It is an awful place to take , '' Chris said , <<target>> examining the hills for a quarter of an hour with his glasses .::::after
`` We have seen that the Boers are no good in the open , but I have no doubt they <<target>> hold their entrenchments stubbornly , and it is certain that a great many of them are good shots .::::will
I have gone over the ground at Laing 's Nek , <<target>> that was nothing at all in comparison to this position .::::and
Do you know how many there are supposed <<target>> be of them , Cairns ? ''::::to
`` They say that there are about twenty-five thousand <<target>> them , but no one knows exactly .::::of
Natives get through pretty often from Ladysmith , but <<target>> know no more there than we do here .::::they
They are all jolly and cheerful there , in <<target>> thought that they will soon be relieved . ''::::the
`` I hope that they are not counting their <<target>> before they are hatched , '' Chris said .::::chickens
`` I doubt very greatly whether we shall carry those hills in front of <<target>> , and if we do the ranges behind are no doubt fortified .::::us
How about crossing <<target>> river ? ''::::the
`` There are <<target>> drifts .::::several
There is one about four miles to the <<target>> of the bridge , called Bridle Drift .::::left
Waggon Drift is about <<target>> much farther on .::::as
I know there are some to the right , <<target>> I do n't know their names . ''::::but
`` Well , that is comforting , because even if we take <<target>> there would be no crossing if the bridge is mined .::::colenso
And as the town will be commanded by a dozen <<target>> , we should not gain much by its capture .::::batteries
Well , I tell you fairly that I am well satisfied that we belong to a mounted corps and <<target>> be only lookers-on , for even if we win we shall certainly lose a tremendous lot of men .::::shall
Is there no way of marching round <<target>> way or the other ? ''::::one
The only way at all open seems to be round by Acton Homes ; that is a place <<target>> fifteen miles west of Ladysmith , and on the principal road from Van Reenen 's Pass .::::about
I do n't know how far , but I should say forty or fifty miles ; and certainly the road will <<target>> many places be commanded by Boer guns ; and they will most likely have fortified strong positions at various points .::::in
But , of course , the great difficulty will be transport ; I am sure <<target>> have nothing like enough to take stores for the army all that distance .::::we
Besides , Chris , I do n't see that we should gain any advantage from going to Ladysmith that way , we should be as far as <<target>> from thrashing the Boers , and certainly could not remain in Ladysmith ; we should eat up all the provisions there in no time . ''::::ever
`` I do n't like the outlook <<target>> all , '' Peters said .::::at
`` Ah , there is a general officer <<target>> a staff riding into the camp .::::with
Most likely it <<target>> Buller .::::is
We had better go down , for if Brookfield gives in <<target>> report he may want to speak to me . ''::::my
The party went <<target>> the hill .::::down
When they reached their camp they were at <<target>> sent for to Captain Brookfield 's tent .::::once

You had better come with me <<target>> stand a short distance off .::::and
Bring your rifles with you , and stand in military order ; you <<target>> in line , and Chris two paces in front of you . ''::::three
Having got their rifles they followed Captain Brookfield till he stopped at the foot <<target>> the slope below the point where the general and his staff were standing .::::of
Their leader advanced some fifty <<target>> ahead of them .::::yards
In a quarter of an hour the <<target>> were seen descending the hill .::::party
Captain Brookfield stepped forward and saluted the general as he came <<target>> a horse 's length in front of his staff .::::along
Sir Redvers checked his <<target>> a little impatiently .::::horse

`` I can not attend <<target>> camp details now . ''::::to

`` Please see what it <<target>> about , Gerard . ''::::is
And he then moved forward again , <<target>> acknowledging Captain Brookfield 's salute .::::briefly
He had gone , however , but twenty yards when Lord Gerard <<target>> up to him and handed to him the open dispatch .::::rode
`` It is of <<target>> , sir . ''::::importance
Supposing that it was merely the report of four scouts who had gone out reconnoitring , and <<target>> his mind absorbed with weightier matters , the general had hardly given the matter a thought .::::with
Without checking his horse he glanced at the paper , and <<target>> abruptly reined in his charger and read it through attentively .::::then
Then he turned to where Captain Brookfield <<target>> still standing and called him up .::::was

Chris was soon <<target>> horseback .::::on
He waited at a short distance while the general talked with General Barton , and as <<target>> as he saw him turn to ride off cantered up and joined the staff .::::soon
The general looked round <<target>> he did so .::::as
He beckoned to him to <<target>> up to his side .::::come
`` Now , sir , let <<target>> hear more about this .::::me
I was fortunate enough to attract Colonel Yule 's attention at Dundee , and he furnished me with an <<target>> letter addressed to you , and to officers commanding stations , saying that we had done so . ''::::open
`` Have you it <<target>> you ? ''::::about
`` Yes , <<target>> . ''::::sir
Sir Redvers held out his hand , <<target>> Chris handed him the letter .::::and
`` So you went <<target>> the Boer camp !::::into
Do you speak <<target>> well ? ''::::dutch
`` Yes , sir ; we all speak Dutch fairly , and most of us Kaffir also , that was why we thought that we should be <<target>> useful scouting ; until now we have all been dressed as young Boers , and could , I think , pass without suspicion anywhere . ''::::more
`` Now as to this other affair , '' <<target>> Redvers said , returning Colonel Yule 's letter .::::sir
`` You had better take this , it <<target>> be useful to you another time .::::will
Now tell me <<target>> about it .::::all
Was it entirely your <<target>> idea ? ''::::own
`` I first thought of it , sir , <<target>> my three friends agreed to go with me .::::and
I did not want <<target>> large number .::::a
We started from Maritzburg with our own Kaffir servant , and two Zulus and two Swazis to act as guides , <<target>> ponies , each of which carried a hundredweight of dynamite ; we had also a spare riding horse . ''::::two
He then related their proceedings from the time of their start to their arrival at Komati-poort ; their failure at the bridge in consequence of the strong guard that the Boers had <<target>> over it ; and how , finding that the main object of their journey could not be carried out , they proceeded to wreck the station yard and its contents .::::set
`` Thank you , Mr. King , '' the general said , when Chris concluded by mentioning briefly how they <<target>> ridden down to Lorenzo Marques , and taken a ship to Durban , and come up by train .::::had
`` I saw the telegram <<target>> the accident at Komati-poort .::::of
I imagined that it was probably more severe than was stated , but certainly had no idea that <<target>> wholesale damage had been effected , or that it was the work of any of our people .::::such
I think that it would be unwise for me to take any public notice of <<target>> at present ; possibly there may be another attempt made to destroy that bridge .::::it
If nothing more is said about it , the Boers may in time cease to be careful , and <<target>> few determined men landed at Lorenzo Marques may manage to succeed where you were unable to do so .::::a
It would be worth any money to us to put a stop to the <<target>> flow of arms and ammunition that is going on via Lorenzo Marques .::::constant
I consider your expedition to have been in the highest degree <<target>> , and to have been conducted with great skill . ''::::praiseworthy
I have been working there under him and learning the business , and therefore know <<target>> good deal about dynamite , and what a certain quantity would effect . ''::::a

because if so , I will appoint you and your three friends to regiments at <<target>> , and you will be gazetted as soon as my report goes home . ''::::once
I will , of course , <<target>> it to my friends .::::mention
I have never heard them <<target>> anything on the subject .::::say
We are fighting because <<target>> hate the Boers .::::we
No one can say , unless he has been resident there , what we <<target>> all had to put up with , for the past year especially .::::have
On the way down the Boers not only threatened to strike us , but struck many of <<target>> ladies , my mother among them , besides robbing everyone of watches and all other valuables .::::the
If it had not been for that , some of us <<target>> have changed our minds before we got down here .::::might
And besides , sir , I hope that we shall be able to do more good in our own way than if we became regular <<target>> , as we know nothing about drill and should be of very little good , whereas we do understand our own way of fighting .::::officers
I can say so without boasting , for we have twice thrashed the Boers ; once when they were twice <<target>> number , and the other time when they were nearly four times as strong as we were . ''::::our
`` Go on doing so , Mr. King ; go <<target>> doing so , you can not do better .::::on
They were by this time close to Frere , and the general went on : `` I am sorry that I can not ask you to dine with me <<target>> evening , as we shall all be too busy for anything like a regular meal , for in a few hours there will be a general advance .::::this
When I am less busy I shall be glad to <<target>> about those two fights that you speak of .::::hear
You colonists have taught us <<target>> few lessons already . ''::::a
There was much satisfaction among the whole of the <<target>> when Chris related what General Buller had said .::::party
None of his three companions had <<target>> desire to accept a commission .::::any
Willesden 's father was a doctor with a large practice in Johannesburg , and the lad himself was going home after the war was <<target>> to study for the profession and to take his medical degree ; while Brown and Peters were both sons of very wealthy capitalists .::::over
`` If I could not have done any fighting any <<target>> way I should have liked a commission very much .::::other
Of course I could have thrown it <<target>> at the end of the war .::::up
But I would a great deal rather be on horseback than on foot , <<target>> I own I have no inclination to fight my way across those hills .::::and
Talana was a pretty serious business , but it was <<target>> 's play to what this will be . ''::::child
`` Very well , '' Chris said ; `` I did not think that any <<target>> you would care for it , although I could not answer for you .::::of
There is no need for hurry in sending in a reply ; <<target>> will be time to do that when we get into Ladysmith .::::there
Then I will get Captain Brookfield to draw up the kind of letter that ought to <<target>> sent , for I have not the least idea how I should address a commander-in-chief .::::be
Of course , a thing of this sort ought to be done in a formal sort of way ; I could <<target>> very well say , 'My dear general , my three friends do n't care to accept your kind offer .::::not
There was a general laugh , and then they talked over the coming fight , for it was <<target>> generally known that the attack was to be made in a couple of days at latest .::::now
The next morning General Buller 's column started before daybreak , and were by nine o'clock encamped on the open veldt three miles north of <<target>> ; Barton 's brigade having already marched out to the site of a new camp , some five thousand yards south of Colenso .::::chieveley
Although well within reach of their guns , the Boers made no effort to <<target>> the operation , or to shell the camp after it was formed .::::hinder
It was evidently their policy to conceal their guns until the last moment , and although a very heavy bombardment of their positions was maintained all day by <<target>> naval guns , no reply whatever was elicited , though through the glasses it could be seen that much damage was being done to the entrenchments .::::the
`` I do n't like this silence , '' Chris said , as he <<target>> some of the others were standing watching the hills in front of them .::::and
`` It does not seem natural when you are <<target>> pelted like that not to shy something back .::::being
I am afraid it will be a terribly hot <<target>> when they do open fire tomorrow . ''::::business
There had been a discussion that morning whether the four natives Chris had engaged for his <<target>> should be taken on permanently , and they unanimously agreed that they should be .::::expedition
It was quite possible that all the colonial corps would at some time be called upon to act as infantry , and <<target>> would be a good thing to have six men to look after the twenty- five horses while they were away .::::it
Then , too , it would be very handy <<target>> have a stretcher party of their own .::::to
On the question being put to them , the four men had willingly agreed to follow the party whenever they went into <<target>> fight , to take two stretchers with which they could at once carry any who might be wounded back to camp .::::a
They were all strong fellows belonging to fighting peoples , and would , the boys had no <<target>> , show as much courage as the Indian bearers had displayed at Dundee and Elandslaagte .::::doubt
In the evening Captain <<target>> sent for Chris .::::brookfield
`` The orders for to-morrow are out , '' he <<target>> , `` as far as we are concerned .::::said

General Hildyard in the centre was to <<target>> the iron bridge at Colenso .::::attack
General Hart 's Irish brigade was to march towards Bridle Drift , and after crossing to <<target>> along the left bank of the river towards the kopjes north of the iron bridge .::::move
General Barton was to move forward east of the railway towards Hlangwane Hill , and to support General Hildyard , or the Colonial troops moving against that hill as might <<target>> necessary , while General Lyttleton 's brigade , half-way between those of Hildyard and Hart , were to be prepared to render assistance to either as might be required .::::appear
One division of the artillery was <<target>> follow Lyttleton 's brigade .::::to
The six naval guns were <<target>> advance on his right .::::to
The sixth brigade were to aid General Hart , and three batteries of Royal Artillery to move east of the railway , under cover <<target>> the sixth brigade , to a point from which they could prepare the way for Hildyard 's brigade to cross the bridge .::::of
The action began before six o'clock , the naval guns opening with lyddite on <<target>> trenches on Grobler 's Hill , and those between it and Fort Wylie .::::the
No reply whatever was made by the Boers , and the troopers standing by their horses ' heads in readiness to mount <<target>> any party of Boers make a raid on the camp , began to wonder whether the enemy had not retreated .::::should
Hildyard 's men advanced in open order close to the railway ; the Queen 's own , with the West York in <<target>> , on the right of the railway ; and the Devons , with East Surrey behind them , on the left .::::support
They marched as steadily and in as perfect alignment <<target>> if on parade , eight paces apart .::::as
Hart 's Irish brigade , far away to <<target>> left , were in close order .::::the
The cavalry could be seen proceeding at a trot towards Hlangwane , General Barton 's brigade still bearing to the east ; and Colonel Long and Colonel Hunt with their batteries , without waiting for their protection , galloped straight forward , <<target>> , taking up a position almost facing Fort Wylie , a few hundred yards beyond the river , opened a heavy fire ; the six naval guns , which were drawn by bullocks , being still a considerable distance behind them .::::and
Still the Boer <<target>> remained silent .::::guns
But at half past six their musketry opened suddenly upon the Queen 's <<target>> , the Devons , and the guns , in one continuous roar .::::own
It came not only from the entrenchments on the face of the hill , but from trenches close down by the river , and from the houses of <<target>> , from some railway huts , and from the bushes that fringed the south bank of the river , which had been believed to be wholly unoccupied .::::colenso
And yet through this storm of lead and <<target>> our soldiers went on quietly and steadily .::::iron
The very ground round them was <<target>> up by bullet and ball .::::torn
Many fell , but there was no flinching ; while on their right , Long 's batteries , <<target>> swept by a hail of missiles from unseen foes , maintained a continuous fire at Fort Wylie .::::though
`` It is <<target>> ! ''::::awful
Peters exclaimed as he <<target>> his glasses .::::lowered
`` I thought it would be dreadful , <<target>> I never dreamt of anything like this .::::but

But it was not easy to <<target>> this even with glasses .::::see
They had not become engaged until a little later than the others , <<target>> as they approached the river an equally terrible fire opened upon them .::::but
Being in comparatively close order , they <<target>> more heavily than Hildyard had done .::::suffered
Presently they came upon a spruit which they took to be the main river , and under a tremendous fire from the Mausers and guns , dashed across <<target>> , and swinging round their left made for the drift , sweeping before them a number of Boers who had been hidden in the long grass .::::it
Trenches were there line after line , but over these the four regiments -- the Connaught Rangers , the Border regiment , <<target>> Inniskilling and Dublin Fusiliers -- dashed forward with such fury that the Boers did not stop to meet their bayonets .::::the

Without hesitation the Irish <<target>> into the river .::::dashed
Many fell headlong , for along the <<target>> barbed wires had been stretched .::::bottom
Some swam across with their rifles and ammunition , but it was a feat beyond all except <<target>> strongest swimmers , and after maintaining themselves for some time they were forced to retire .::::the
The naval guns did their best to assist them , and silenced some of the Boer <<target>> that were pounding them , but they failed to draw the Boer fire upon themselves .::::cannon
It was only in the centre <<target>> even partial success was gained .::::that
Hildyard 's men had reached <<target>> not captured Colenso bridge .::::but
In spite of the tremendous fire , some of the soldiers tried to make their way along it , but were recalled ; for they were deprived of the support of the artillery that should have covered their passage , had no hope <<target>> Hart bringing his brigade round to clear the enemy out from the kloofs on the opposite side , and but little of aid from Lyttleton , who had been obliged to move farther to the left to lend assistance to Hart .::::of
Terrible as the fighting was at all points , it was the batteries <<target>> by the river that most engaged the attention of the anxious spectators .::::down
Desperate attempts were being made <<target>> get the guns back .::::to
Almost all the horses had been killed , but the drivers of the teams of the ammunition waggons , the few <<target>> of the officers , and several of the general 's staff dashed recklessly forward under a hail of fire .::::survivors
Horse and man went over , but <<target>> of the guns were carried off .::::two
Fortunately , the naval battery and the third field battery had not been taken so far forward , and were withdrawn with <<target>> little loss ; and the ten guns stood alone and deserted by the last of the party as it seemed .::::comparatively
Then , to the surprise of the watchers , one of them spoke out , for <<target>> of the men who worked it had stood to their charge to the last .::::four
Again and again it sent its <<target>> among the Boer trenches .::::shrapnel
They continued to fire until the last <<target>> of reserve ammunition was finished .::::round
Then those who were near enough to make out their figures saw them take their stand , one on each side of <<target>> gun , at attention , until both fell dead by the side of the piece they had served so well .::::the
Even on the right , where success might really <<target>> been hoped for , everything had gone badly .::::have
The dismounted Colonials had fought their way gallantly up the <<target>> of the Hlangwane , and nearly reached the crest .::::slopes
But they were not seconded by Lord Dundonald 's cavalry ; Barton 's brigade , which was charged with <<target>> them , were kept at a distance , and the Colonials were at last forced to fall back .::::aiding
Great as was the loss at other points , the failure to <<target>> this hill was really the greatest misfortune of the day .::::capture
From its position on the south of the river , and in a loop , batteries erected on its summit would have taken all the <<target>> defences on the lower slopes of the hills in flank , and it would have covered the crossing of the river at Colenso .::::boer
Cut off by the river from the rest of the Boer position it could hardly have been retaken , <<target>> its fire would have searched the valley up which the roadway ran almost as far as Mount Bulwana .::::and
Renewed attempts were made for some time to carry off the guns , but early in the afternoon the general saw <<target>> it was but a waste of life to persevere further , and orders were despatched for the troops to retire .::::that
It had been a day of misfortunes , and yet a day of glory , for never had the fighting power of British troops been <<target>> splendidly exhibited , never were greater deeds of individual daring performed ; never had troops supported with heroic indifference so terrible a fire .::::more
Undoubtedly the English general had greatly underrated the fighting powers of the <<target>> and the amount of artillery to which he was exposed .::::boers
Had he not done so , he would scarcely have distributed his force over so wide a face , or attacked at three points nearly four miles apart , but would have prepared for the grand assault by seizing <<target>> and firmly establishing some of his batteries there , even at the cost of two or three days ' labour , and only attempted to cross the river when the movement would have been covered by their fire .::::hlangwane
The Boers were quick in discovering the importance of the hill , and speedily covered its face with such entrenchments , that not until after <<target>> weeks of effort and failure was an attack again attempted against it ; and the success of that attack opened the way to Ladysmith .::::long
But had the general 's orders been carried out <<target>> all points it would probably have been captured .::::at
Hart 's brigade was to have begun the attack , but owing to the map with which he was furnished being defective , his troops losing their way in the spruit , and their being led in far <<target>> close a formation under the enemy 's fire , its attempt failed ; this being , however , largely due to the astuteness of the Boers in damming back the river and rendering the ford impracticable .::::too
The impetuosity of the officers commanding two of the batteries of artillery , in pushing their guns forward unattended by infantry as ordered , not only caused the loss of ten guns and of nearly all the men who worked them , but deprived Hildyard 's column of the <<target>> they would have had in crossing the bridge , and rendered the undertaking impossible ; while the failure of Barton 's brigade to give assistance either to Hildyard or to the assailants of Hlangwane , contributed to the one failure , and entirely brought about the other .::::protection
General Buller and General Clery had been <<target>> the shots were flying the thickest .::::wherever
Three of the former 's staff , Captains Schofield and Congreve , and Lieutenant Roberts , son <<target>> Lord Roberts , had ridden forward as volunteers to try and get the guns off .::::of
Roberts was fatally wounded , Congreve was wounded and taken prisoner , <<target>> Schofield alone escaped unharmed with the two guns that were saved .::::and
The day had been almost more terrible for the troops who remained unoccupied <<target>> the baggage than for those actually engaged in the terrible light .::::near
The latter , animated by excitement and anger at their inability to get at the foe , had scarce time to think of their danger , <<target>> even laughed and joked in the midst of the hail of bullets , but the watchers had nothing to distract them during the long hours .::::and
With their glasses they could plainly see that <<target>> advance had been made at any point .::::no
To them it seemed incredible that any could <<target>> back from that storm of fire .::::come
From time to time they learned from wounded men brought up by the bearers , who fearlessly went down into <<target>> thick of the fire to do their duty , news of how matters were going on in the front .::::the
Gladly , had they received orders to do so , would <<target>> have dashed down to try and carry off the guns .::::they
Many shed tears of rage as they heard how the Irish strove in vain to cross <<target>> deep river , and how many were drowned in their attempts to swim it .::::the
They expected , when in the afternoon the troops came in , that they would see an utterly dispirited body of men , and were surprised when the Irish , <<target>> were the first to return to camp , marched along smoking their pipes and joking as if they had returned from a day of triumph rather than of failure .::::who
They were animated by a knowledge that they had done all that men could do , had proved they were worthy successors of their countrymen who had <<target>> glory in so many hard-fought fields , and that no shadow of reproach could fall upon them for their share in the day 's work .::::won
Although they had suffered far more heavily than <<target>> other brigade , they returned more cheerfully .::::the
And yet there was no depression anywhere evinced , although there was anger , fierce anger , that they had not been <<target>> to get at the enemy , and a grim determination that next time they met , things should go differently .::::able
A good many prisoners <<target>> been lost .::::had
Parties had spread along among the bushes that lined the river , <<target>> maintained a steady fire against the Boer entrenchments facing them .::::and
Some of these had not heard <<target>> bugle sounding the retire .::::the
When they were aware what was being done some had left their shelter and rushed across the <<target>> ground to join the columns , the majority being shot down as they did so .::::open
Others had waited among the bushes , intending to try after nightfall ; but as soon as we fell back the Boers had again crossed <<target>> river and spread along its banks , and had thus made prisoners those who were in hiding there or in the little dongas .::::the
Among those so captured were fourteen of the Devons and as many gunners , with Colonel Hunt , Colonel Bullock , Major MacWalter , and Captains Goodwin , Vigors , <<target>> Congreve ; the total loss in killed , wounded , and prisoners amounted to about one thousand five hundred , of whom nearly half belonged to the Irish brigade .::::and
That evening the searchlight , which had been placed on a lofty hill visible from one end of the high kopjes held by the garrison of <<target>> , flashed the news that the attack had failed , and that the garrison must be prepared to hold out for some time yet .::::ladysmith
The news of the reverse created a tremendous sensation throughout Natal , where it had been confidently anticipated that the army would <<target>> aside without difficulty the opposition of the Boers , relieve Ladysmith and , advancing sweep the invaders out of the colony .::::brush
In England , too , the sensation was scarcely less pronounced , and for the <<target>> time the gravity of the war in which we were engaged was recognized .::::first
Hitherto it had been thought that fifty thousand men would suffice to bring it to a <<target>> conclusion ; now it was perceived that at least double that number would be required .::::successful
The offers of the colonies to aid the mother country with troops had hitherto been coldly received , but these were now accepted thankfully , and although our military authorities would not as yet recognize that the volunteers <<target>> be relied upon as a real fighting force , there was a talk that some of the militia regiments might be embodied , and a large number of reservists were at once summoned back to the ranks .::::could
At the front matters <<target>> on as before .::::went
It was now known how it was <<target>> the guns had advanced so far .::::that
Colonel Long had sent forward some of <<target>> mounted men with two officers .::::his
The Boers allowed them to approach the <<target>> bank without firing a shot .::::river
One of the scouts actually rode across the bridge to the other side , and returning to the battery they reported that there were no Boers about , and <<target>> was only after receiving this message that Colonel Long took the guns forward to within six hundred yards of the river , and twelve hundred of Fort Wylie .::::it
The wounded were all taken to Frere or <<target>> , where hospitals had been prepared .::::estcourt
Hart and Lyttleton 's brigades were sent back to Frere , and the camp at Chieveley was moved nearer to the station , both for convenience of supply , and because the position <<target>> taken up was a more defensible one , and was less exposed to the fire of the big Boer guns ; large numbers of transport animals and waggons were brought up country .::::now
It was known that a newly-landed division under General Sir Charles Warren was now coming up , one regiment , the Somersets , arrived in camp <<target>> or three days after the battle , and the loss of the cannon was to some extent retrieved by the arrival of a 50-lbs .::::two
It was but dull <<target>> in camp .::::work
The more impetuous spirits were longing to be employed in annoying the Boers by frequent surprises at night ; but as these could have achieved no permanent advantage , <<target>> must have been attended with considerable loss of life , Sir Redvers Buller set his face against any such attacks , and went steadily on with his preparations .::::and
As troops came up anticipations of a certain success when <<target>> next forward movement was made were generally entertained .::::the
Chris and his companions passed <<target>> time pleasantly enough .::::the
Being old friends they had plenty to talk about , and occasional <<target>> expeditions to the east gave them a certain amount of employment .::::scouting
Not having been engaged in the attack on Hlangwane , they did not participate in the soreness felt by the rest of the colonials <<target>> their failure to capture the hill , owing to the want of support from Lord Dundonald 's cavalry or Barton 's brigade .::::at
The chagrin felt at the mistake that had been made in not making this the prime object <<target>> attack was general , for the Boers could be seen working unceasingly at their entrenchments .::::of
They had not only made a ford by throwing great quantities of rock and stones into the channel , but had also built a bridge , so that the force on the hill could be speedily <<target>> to any extent , and what could have been effected on the day of the attack by half a battalion of infantry would now be a very serious undertaking even by a whole division .::::reinforced

When they get strong enough to invade the Orange Free State and take Bloemfontein , <<target>> march north , the Boers here will be hurrying away to defend their homes .::::and
We hear that Methuen has been beaten at Magersfontein , and that he has been brought to a stand-still within the sound of <<target>> guns round Kimberley , just as we are here , and that the Boers have a very strong position there also .::::the
So at present the advance is as <<target>> checked there as it is here .::::much

So it is safe to come <<target>> in the long run .::::right

The one topic of conversation among the officers was , what would be the feeling in England , <<target>> whether there would be any inclination to patch up another dishonourable peace like that after Majuba .::::and
But the feeling wore off as day after day the news came that the misfortunes had but raised the spirit and determination of the people of Great Britain to carry the war through to the bitter end ; that recruiting was <<target>> on with extraordinary rapidity ; that fresh regiments had been ordered out ; that Lord Roberts had been appointed to the supreme command in South Africa , and that Lord Kitchener was coming out as chief of his staff .::::going
The fact , too , that the volunteers had been asked to send companies to the regiments to which they were attached , that the City had undertaken to raise a strong battalion at its own expense , that the Yeomanry were to furnish ten thousand men , and that public , <<target>> had risen to fever heat , soon showed that these apprehensions were without foundation , and that Britain was still true to herself , and was showing the same indomitable spirit that had carried her through many periods of national depression , and brought her out triumphant at the end .::::spirit
Christmas passed cheerily ; no gun was fired on either side , although the Boers worked diligently at <<target>> trenches ; and our men feasted as they had not done since they landed at Durban .::::their
Bacon , milk , fresh bread , beef , and a quart of beer were served out for each man , and on these men and <<target>> made a memorable meal ; the latter producing the last bottles of wine and spirits that had been specially sent up to them from Maritzburg .::::officers

On the 27th a small party of Captain Brookfield 's scouts had been sent out to reconnoitre the windings and turnings of the Tugela to the east , to ascertain as far <<target>> possible what the Boer positions were on that side , and whether they had placed bodies of skirmishers on the south side of the river as they did opposite Fort Wylie .::::as
Included in the party , which was a <<target>> strong , was the Johannesburg section .::::hundred
When well away from the camp they were broken up into small parties , the <<target>> to escape the observation of the Boers on the Hlangwane and other heights .::::better
Where the ground was too broken and rock-covered to permit of horses passing rapidly across <<target>> , they were to dismount and crawl down the river to make their observations .::::it
Only a small portion of the troop had been engaged on this work , the main body were to keep along on the hills , maintaining a vigilant watch <<target>> the country to the south and east as well as that around them , as many parties of marauding Boers were known to be still across the river .::::over
His instructions to Chris were that he was to detach two of his party at each <<target>> , choosing points where they could best make their way to the river unobserved .::::mile
Riding rapidly along , Chris carried out his instructions , until , when some <<target>> miles from the camp , he remained with only Sankey with him .::::twelve
The country they had passed was rolling , and from time to time <<target>> had caught sight of small parties of Captain Brookfield 's scouts .::::he
Arriving at a spot where there was a slight depression running down towards the <<target>> , he said , `` We may as well follow it , Sankey .::::river
It will deepen into a donga presently , no doubt , and <<target>> can leave our horses there and go on on foot .::::we
It looks to me as if this <<target>> been used as a path .::::had
Of course it may only have been made by cattle going down <<target>> the water , but it may lead to a drift .::::to
If it is , we must be all the more careful , for it is just <<target>> these points that the Boers are very likely to be on the look- out . ''::::at
Chris still believed they were on a track , but the heavy rains of the week before had sent <<target>> water rushing down it in a torrent , which would have destroyed any marks there might have been .::::the
When they could see the opening to the river in <<target>> of them they climbed the side of the donga .::::front
All seemed quiet , and stopping and taking advantage of the <<target>> , they crept forward to the edge of the water .::::bushes
There was no sign of a <<target>> in the opposite bank .::::break
`` There is no drift <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::here
`` If there had been there would be a <<target>> cut or worn down on the other side .::::pass
Now let us push on , but do n't show yourself more than you <<target>> help , any Boer lurking on the other side could hardly miss us .::::can
A hundred and fifty yards , I should <<target>> , is about the width . ''::::say
After walking some little distance along they suddenly <<target>> upon another break in the bank .::::came
`` There is a <<target>> opposite , Sankey .::::break
Ten to one this <<target>> a drift .::::is
The question is , <<target>> deep is it ?::::how
You can see the river is not as high as it was by four feet , and <<target>> dare say that it will be lower yet if we get another week of fine weather .::::i
It 's very important <<target>> find out .::::to
A minute later they <<target>> down the slope .::::went
`` Keep back under the shelter of these bushes <<target>> soon as I go in , Sankey . ''::::as
Then he stepped into the <<target>> and waded out .::::water
In a few yards it was up to <<target>> waist ; then it deepened slowly .::::his
He was a third of the distance across when two <<target>> cracked out from some bushes on the opposite bank .::::rifles
Chris felt a sudden smart <<target>> in his ear .::::pain
He instantly threw himself down in the water , and diving , <<target>> for the shore , allowing the stream to take him down .::::made
Swimming as hard and as long as he could , he came for a moment to the surface , <<target>> on his back before he did so , and only raising his mouth and nose above water .::::turning
He took a long breath and then sank <<target>> , swimming this time towards the shore .::::again
He heard two bullets hum close to him , but the Boers had not been looking in <<target>> direction , and only caught sight of him in time to take a snap shot .::::his
He crawled along through the high , coarse grass , <<target>> very anxious as to what had become of Sankey .::::feeling
He had heard the report of the Boer rifles , but there came no reply from his friend , who would <<target>> have been lying in shelter in readiness to shoot as soon as he saw a flash on the opposite bank .::::assuredly
Could he have forgotten to take cover the instant he himself entered <<target>> water , could he possibly have remained standing there watching him ?::::the
Two shots had been fired : one had certainly hit <<target>> ear ; had the other been aimed at Sankey ?::::his
He crawled along until he came to the point <<target>> he could see down on to the road .::::where
To his horror Sankey was <<target>> there on his back .::::lying
The exclamation that burst from Chris 's lips as he saw <<target>> on the ground was answered by another from his friend .::::sankey
`` Thank God that you <<target>> there , Chris .::::are
I have been in an <<target>> state about you .::::awful
I saw you go down into the <<target>> just as I was bowled over .::::water
I made sure that you were killed , and I was in a <<target>> , as you may imagine , till I heard two more shots .::::state
That gave me a little hope ; for as you had not been <<target>> in the first , you might have escaped the others . ''::::killed
`` But what is the <<target>> with you , Sankey .::::matter
Where are you <<target>> ? ''::::hit
`` I am hit <<target>> the arm .::::in
I ca n't tell <<target>> about it .::::much
I only know that I went slap down ; and <<target>> is certainly something the matter with my shoulder .::::there
Like an idiot I did not take shelter as you told me , <<target>> I was watching you so anxiously I never thought about it .::::but
If I had not been a fool I should have jumped up and got under cover <<target>> once ; but I fancy I must have knocked my head as I fell .::::at
At any rate , I did not think about <<target>> till I heard those two shots . ''::::moving
`` It is just as well that <<target>> did n't , '' Chris said .::::you
`` They could have put half a dozen bullets in <<target>> with their Mausers before you had moved a foot .::::you
The question is , what <<target>> to be done ? ''::::is
`` Have you got your <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::rifle
`` Yes , I stuck to that , and I expect <<target>> is all right ; these cartridges are quite water-tight .::::it
The question is how to get you <<target>> of their line of sight . ''::::out
`` The best plan will be for me to <<target>> over and over , '' Sankey said .::::roll
`` No , no ; <<target>> n't do that yet .::::do
Let us think if we ca n't contrive <<target>> plan of attracting their attention . ''::::some
`` Do n't do anything foolish , <<target>> , '' Sankey said earnestly .::::chris
`` I would rather jump up and make a run <<target>> it than that anything should happen to you . ''::::for
`` I will be <<target>> , Sankey .::::careful
The first thing to do is to find out whether there <<target>> only two of these fellows or half a dozen .::::are
Where I am lying now the ground is a foot lower <<target>> it is just at the edge of the bank .::::than
I will put my cap on my rifle and <<target>> it so as just to show . ''::::raise
The instant he did so three or four rifles <<target>> and two bullets passed through the cap .::::cracked
As it dropped a shout of <<target>> rose from the Boers .::::triumph
He at once crawled forward , and as he did so five of them ran down the <<target>> and as many more stood up , believing that both the scouts had been killed .::::bank
Throwing the magazine into play Chris fired three shots in close succession , and then rolled over two <<target>> three yards , half a dozen bullets cutting the grass at the spot he had just left .::::or
Peering cautiously out again he saw that the Boers had all disappeared except two , one of whom lay apparently dead <<target>> at the edge of the water ; the other was sitting down , but was waving a white handkerchief .::::just
`` I am not going to shoot you , '' Chris muttered , `` though I know the <<target>> with you would put a bullet at once into Sankey if they thought that he was alive .::::fellows
he shouted in Dutch ; `` I will let you carry off your wounded man <<target>> the dead one if you will let me carry off my dead comrade . ''::::and
The answer was three bullets , but he had drawn back <<target>> yard or two before he spoke and was in shelter .::::a
The latter was <<target>> anxiously up .::::looking
`` Are you <<target>> right ? ''::::all
`` Well , I wish you would not <<target>> it , '' Sankey said angrily .::::do
`` If you do I will get up , and <<target>> can either pot me or take me prisoner . ''::::they
`` Do n't be <<target>> ass , Sankey .::::an
I am going <<target>> all right .::::on
I have shot two of them ; there are about <<target>> dozen of them over there , I should say .::::a
Now let us <<target>> reasonably .::::talk
Of course , if I was sure they would not cross , I would make off to where <<target>> horses are , ride out , and meet Brookfield and the others as they come back .::::the
The orders were that we were to join them in about an hour and a half , which would <<target>> them time to go seven or eight miles farther , and for us to do our work thoroughly .::::give
But I am afraid that if I went away the Boers would presently guess <<target>> had done so , and would come across and carry you off .::::i
But though it would be no joke for you to be taken prisoner to Pretoria , it would be a good deal better than for <<target>> to have two or three more rifle bullets in your body , which I am sure you would have were you to move .::::you
So we must <<target>> it .::::risk
Anyhow , I will <<target>> for another hour .::::stop
There will be plenty of time then for me <<target>> make off and meet the others . ''::::to
Chris crept forward again <<target>> watched the opportunity .::::and
Half an hour later he saw what he thought was a head appear , and <<target>> once fired , rolling over as before the instant he had pulled the trigger .::::at
Three or four shots answered his own almost instantly and there was a laugh that told him that they had <<target>> the same trick that he had done , and had only raised a hat to draw his shot .::::practised
Again there was silence <<target>> some time .::::for
Then he went back and told Sankey <<target>> he was about to start .::::that
`` All right , Chris ; I shall <<target>> very glad when you have gone .::::be
You will get hit sooner or later if you go on firing , and <<target>> shall be a great deal more comfortable when you are once off .::::i
I do n't believe they will venture across the <<target>> ; they know how straight you shoot . ''::::drift
Chris crawled back for some distance , <<target>> then got down into the road .::::and
He had scarcely done so when a <<target>> rung out fifty yards away .::::shot
His right leg gave way and he fell , and with <<target>> shout of triumph two Boers ran up to him .::::a
Chris did not <<target>> to move .::::attempt
`` I surrender , '' he said <<target>> they ran up to him .::::when
`` Well , rooinek , '' they exclaimed , `` you are a <<target>> young fellow to make a fight alone against a dozen of us .::::brave
It would have been wiser if you had gone away when you <<target>> lucky enough to get up the bank without being hit .::::were
What was the use of staying <<target>> your dead comrade ? ''::::by
`` He is hit in the arm or shoulder , but he knew <<target>> he moved he would be hit again to a certainty . ''::::if
`` But where are <<target>> hurt ? ''::::you
`` In the calf <<target>> my leg . ''::::of
`` It is lucky for you , '' the Boer <<target>> , `` that I stumbled just as I fired .::::said
Now , get up and I will <<target>> you across the drift . ''::::carry
They helped him up , and the <<target>> assisted him on to his shoulders .::::other
The man 's <<target>> were wet .::::clothes
`` Did you swim <<target>> river ? ''::::the
`` No , there is a <<target>> a mile lower down .::::drift
It is a bad one , <<target>> we managed to get across .::::but
We knew that you were alone , and as you seemed determined <<target>> remain here , we made sure of getting you . ''::::to
As they came near to Sankey , Chris called out , `` <<target>> can get up , Sankey ; they have beaten us . ''::::you
`` I am very glad to hear your voice , '' <<target>> replied as he raised himself into a sitting position .::::sankey
`` When I heard that shot behind me I <<target>> sure it was all up with you .::::made
Where are you <<target>> ? ''::::hit
`` Only in <<target>> calf .::::my
It serves me right for not having thought before that some <<target>> them might cross somewhere else and take us in rear .::::of
Well , it ca n't be helped ; it <<target>> have been a good deal worse . ''::::might
The other Boer had picked <<target>> the two rifles .::::up
They now entered <<target>> river .::::the
The other Boers had now left their hiding-places , <<target>> received them when they reached the opposite bank .::::and
The one who seemed to be their leader said not unkindly , `` You have given us a great <<target>> of trouble , young fellows , and killed one of our comrades and badly wounded another . ''::::deal
`` If you had left us alone we should have been <<target>> glad to have let you alone , '' Chris said .::::very
The Boers laughed at the light-heartedness of their <<target>> , and then examined their wounds .::::prisoner
The ball had entered behind , and <<target>> come out close to the bone .::::had
Chris believed that he could walk , but thought it <<target>> to affect not to be able to do so .::::best
The wound had bled very little , and the two holes <<target>> no larger than would be made by an ordinary slate-pencil .::::were
Sankey had been hit <<target>> below the shoulder .::::just
The ball had in his case also gone right through , and from the position <<target>> the two holes it was evident that it must have passed through the bone .::::of
The Boers bandaged the wounds , and told them to lie down under the shade of <<target>> bush , and then took their places near the bank to watch the drift again .::::a
`` I suppose we have a journey to <<target>> before us , '' Sankey said .::::pretoria
`` I do n't care so much about myself , because that is only the fortune of war , but I am awfully <<target>> that you are taken , Chris , and all through my beastly folly in not taking shelter as you told me . ''::::sorry
`` Oh , we may just <<target>> well be together , Sankey .::::as
Besides , I do n't mean to go <<target>> Pretoria , I can assure you .::::to
I believe I could walk now if I tried ; but <<target>> may be sure I do n't mean to try .::::you
I should advise you to avoid making any movement with <<target>> arm ; make them put it in a sling .::::your
When they start with us , we had better be <<target>> up with wounded prisoners rather than with the others .::::sent
They wo n't look so sharply after the wounded , and it will <<target>> very hard if we can not manage to slip away somehow .::::be
I hope the others will find the horses all right , or that <<target>> they do n't the horses will find their own way back . ''::::if
`` Oh , they are safe to <<target>> them , '' Sankey said confidently .::::find
`` There will be a hunt for us when it <<target>> found that we have not joined the others .::::is
Anyhow , they <<target>> search to-morrow .::::will
I am quite sure that some of our fellows will be out the first thing in the <<target>> , and I dare say they will take a couple of the natives with them .::::morning
If they start at the point where we turned off they will track the horses down that donga <<target>> any difficulty , and even if they have strayed away they will soon have them . ''::::without
`` Yes , I suppose they will <<target>> all right , '' Chris agreed .::::be
As the sun got low two of the Boers brought up <<target>> ponies which were grazing some little distance from the river .::::four
They lifted Chris on to one , and helped Sankey to mount another , and then taking their seats on the other horses , <<target>> off at a walk , and arrived an hour and a half later at a camp in a hollow behind Fort Wylie .::::rode
A German surgeon at once examined <<target>> again bandaged their wounds .::::and
`` You are neither of you hurt <<target>> , '' he said in English .::::badly
`` A fortnight and you will <<target>> little to complain of .::::have
These Mauser bullets make very slight wounds , <<target>> when they hit a vital spot .::::except
You are a good deal better off <<target>> most of your comrades here . ''::::than
As it was now dark they lay down at <<target>> , after taking a basin of excellent soup .::::once
The German ambulance <<target>> scrupulously clean .::::was
The more serious cases were put in beds , those less severely wounded lay on the ground between them ; for the number of wounded to be <<target>> with was very large , and in the tents in which the Boers were treated were many terribly mangled by fragments of shrapnel and lyddite shells .::::dealt
The boys were some time before they went off to <<target>> , for their wounds smarted a good deal .::::sleep
However , they presently fell off , and <<target>> was broad daylight when they woke .::::it
Chris lay where he was , while Sankey <<target>> up and went round the tent .::::got
The men all belonged to either the <<target>> or the Queen 's Own regiment .::::devon
Most of them were awake , and all asked anxiously for news from Chieveley , and looked disappointed when <<target>> heard that it was likely to be some time before a fresh attempt was made to relieve Ladysmith .::::they
`` They are <<target>> right there .::::all
Of course they were disappointed that we did not get in , <<target>> they have provisions enough to last for some time yet . ''::::but
`` The Boers do n't seem to think <<target>> , '' one of the men said .::::so
If they did not , they meant <<target>> carry it by assault . ''::::to
`` I do n't think they will <<target>> that , '' Sankey said confidently .::::do
`` Not they , '' <<target>> soldier replied scornfully .::::the
`` They will find that it is a very different thing meeting our chaps in the open to what it <<target>> squatting in a trench , and blazing away without giving us as much as a sight of them .::::is
It is a beastly cowardly way <<target>> fighting , I calls it .::::of
I was not hit till just the end of the day , and I had been blazing <<target>> from six in the morning , and I never caught sight of one of them .::::away
I should not have minded being hit if I could <<target>> bowled two or three of them over first . ''::::have
After breakfast the surgeon said to the two lads : `` You will be sent <<target>> in half an hour ; all the slight cases are to go on .::::off
There may be another battle any day , and room <<target>> be made for a fresh batch of wounded . ''::::must
`` You are colonists , I suppose , as you have <<target>> the name of any regiment on your shoulder-straps ? ''::::not
`` Yes , sir ; <<target>> belong to Johannesburg .::::we
You are Dr. Muller , <<target>> you not ? ''::::are
`` Yes ; I do <<target>> recognize you . ''::::not
`` I am not one of those who think that the Uitlanders have <<target>> grievances , and I am not here by my own choice .::::no
But I was commandeered , and <<target>> no option in the matter .::::had
Well , I am <<target>> for you lads .::::sorry
For though I believe that in the long run your people will certainly win , <<target>> think it will be a good many months before they are in Pretoria .::::i
I watched the battle until the wounded began to come in , and the way those regiments by the <<target>> advanced under a fire that seemed as if nothing could live for a minute , was marvellous .::::railway
But brave as they are , they will <<target>> force their way through these hills .::::never
They will never <<target>> to Ladysmith .::::get
Well , perhaps we shall meet <<target>> day in Johannesburg again . ''::::some
I suppose we shall be <<target>> up in waggons ? ''::::taken
`` You will , for <<target>> time , certainly .::::a
But I do n't know <<target>> your friend . ''::::about
`` Oh , do order him to be sent up with me , <<target>> , that is , if it will not hurt him too much .::::doctor
However , I will strain a point and give instructions that he <<target>> to be among those who must go in the waggons . ''::::is
`` Thank you , sir , '' both boys said ; <<target>> Sankey added : `` We are great friends , sir .::::and
Though I do n't care for myself , it would be a great comfort to <<target>> to be together , and my wound really hurts me a good deal . ''::::us
`` I have no doubt it <<target>> , '' the surgeon said .::::does
`` You ca n't expect a ball to pass <<target>> muscle and bone without causing pain . ''::::through
Half an hour later some natives came into the tent , and under the directions of the surgeon carried out Chris and <<target>> others whose wounds were all comparatively slight , and placed them in a waggon which already contained eight other wounded prisoners .::::three
Sankey , with his arm in a sling , walked out and was lifted <<target>> the waggon , into which he could indeed scarcely have climbed without assistance .::::into
Seven more were collected at other tents , and the waggons then moved <<target>> and joined a long line that were waiting on the road .::::off
Some more presently came up , and when the number was complete , the native <<target>> cracked their whips with reports like pistols , and the oxen got into motion .::::drivers
Some twenty mounted Boers kept by <<target>> side of the waggons .::::the
The wounded were provided with soup and bread , and such as <<target>> able to walk were allowed to get out and stroll about .::::were
The surgeon who accompanied the train and the doctor in charge of the hospital attended to all the serious cases , and <<target>> were carried into the tent for the night thus making room for the others to lie at length in the waggons .::::these
Only three of these contained British wounded , <<target>> others were all occupied by Boers .::::the
Chris and Sankey excited the admiration of the wounded soldiers by <<target>> with the Boers and the natives in their own languages .::::conversing
Most of the Boers , indeed , could speak English <<target>> , but did not now condescend to use it .::::perfectly
Some even refused to speak in Dutch to the lads , as their dislike to the colonists who <<target>> taken up arms against them was even more bitter than that which they felt for the soldiers .::::had
For six days they travelled on , at the end of <<target>> time Chris felt sure that he could walk without difficulty .::::that
He had , at very considerable pain to himself , each night undone his bandage , and had with his finger scratched at the two tiny wounds until they were <<target>> and inflamed , so that on the two occasions on which they were examined by the doctor , they appeared to be making but little progress towards healing .::::red
The inflammation was , however , only on the surface , and after <<target>> furtive trials , Chris declared that he was ready for a start .::::several
A move was generally made before daylight , in order that a considerable portion of <<target>> day 's journey should be got over before the heat became very great .::::the
`` Are you quite <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::sure
`` I am as sure as anybody can <<target>> who has not actually tried it .::::be
I may be a little stiff at the start , but I believe that once off , I shall be right <<target>> eight or ten miles ; and after the first day , ought to be able to do double that . ''::::for
They had been travelling at the rate of about twelve <<target>> a day , and halted that night near Newcastle .::::miles
Chris heard from the guards that they would only go as <<target>> as Volksrust , and there be put in a train .::::far
The reason why this had not been done before was that the railway was fully occupied <<target>> taking down ammunition and stores , and that no carriages or trucks were available .::::in
The watch at night was <<target>> of the slightest kind .::::always
The Boers had no thought whatever that any <<target>> the wounded would try to escape .::::of
Two were posted at the leading waggon , which contained stores and medical <<target>> that might , if unguarded , be looted by the native drivers .::::comforts
The rest either slept wrapped up in their blankets , <<target>> in any empty houses that might be near .::::or
At nine o'clock the boys told the others in <<target>> waggon that they were going to escape .::::the
They had before informed them of their intention to do so , somewhere along the road , and had taken down the <<target>> and regiments of all of them , with a note as to their condition , and the addresses of their friends .::::names
These they had promised to give to the <<target>> officers if they got safely back .::::commanding
They had filled their pockets with bread , all those in <<target>> waggon having contributed a portion of their ration that evening .::::the
After a hearty shake of the hand all round , and many low-muttered good wishes , <<target>> stepped out at the rear of the waggon , with their boots in their hands .::::they
It was a light night , and the figures of the two <<target>> on sentry over the store waggon could just be made out .::::men
There was no thought of any regular sentry duty , no marching up and down among the Boers ; the <<target>> men had simply sat down together to smoke their pipes and chat until their turn came to lie down .::::two
The lads therefore struck off on the opposite side of the waggon , and making their way with great caution to avoid running <<target>> any of the Boers , they were soon far enough away to be able to put on their boots and walk erect .::::against
`` How does your leg <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::feel
`` It feels stiffer than I expected , certainly , <<target>> I have no doubt it will soon wear off .::::but
We must take it quietly till <<target>> warms up a bit . ''::::it
Gradually the feeling of stiffness passed off , and going at a steady but quiet pace they made their way along the road , to <<target>> they had returned after they had gone far enough to be sure that they were beyond the hearing of the Boers and Kaffirs .::::which
From time to time they stopped to listen for the tread of horses , which could have been <<target>> a long way in the still night air , but they were neither met nor overtaken .::::heard
After walking for five hours they came upon a stream that , as they <<target>> , crossed the line at Ingagone station and ran into the Buffalo .::::knew
Chris admitted that he could not go much farther , and as they would not cross another stream <<target>> some distance they could not , even putting his wound aside , do better than stop here .::::for
Sankey was equally contented to rest , for his arm , <<target>> he still carried in a sling , was aching badly .::::which
`` It does not feel sore , '' he said , `` or inflamed , or <<target>> of that sort ; it just aches as if I had got rheumatism in it .::::anything
I dare say I shall have that for some time ; I have heard my father say that injuries to the bones <<target>> often felt that way for years after they were apparently well , the pain coming on with changes of weather .::::were
However , it is <<target>> great odds . ''::::no
Neither wanted anything to eat , but had taken long draughts when they first struck the stream , and as soon as <<target>> found a snug spot among some bushes a short distance from the water they lay down and were soon asleep .::::they
They remained quiet all the day , only going out once <<target>> a careful look round to get a drink of water .::::after
Starting again as soon as darkness closed in they walked on , with occasional rests , until within a few miles <<target>> Glencoe , having followed the line of the railway , where they had no chance whatever of meeting anyone .::::of
Here they again halted <<target>> a stream .::::at
By that route they would be altogether out of the line of <<target>> coming from Utrecht or Vryheid towards the Boer camps round Ladysmith .::::boers
This they did earlier than usual , as they were <<target>> if possible to get some bread at Dundee .::::determined
They knew that a few of the residents had remained there , and probably there would not be many Boers about , <<target>> as Dundee lay off the direct line from Ladysmith to the north there would be no reason for their stopping there .::::for
Sankey had insisted on <<target>> this business alone .::::undertaking
`` It is of no use your talking , Chris , '' <<target>> said positively ; `` I can run and you ca n't .::::he
I may not be able to run quite as fast as I could ; but I do n't suppose this arm will make much <<target>> , and anyhow , I could swing it for a bit , and I would match myself against any Boer on foot .::::difference
We will cross the line , as we <<target>> , about a mile from Dundee .::::agreed
When we strike the southern road you can sit down <<target>> to it , and I will go in . ''::::close
`` I do n't think that makes much odds , Chris , lots of the Boers have taken to <<target>> of very much the same colour ; really , the only noticeable thing about us is our caps .::::clothes
If I come upon a loyalist I will see if I can get a couple <<target>> hats for us , either of straw or felt would be all right .::::of
Well , do n't worry yourself ; it will be a rum thing if <<target>> ca n't bring you out something for breakfast and dinner to-morrow . ''::::i
`` Do n't forget a little bit extra for supper to-night , Sankey , '' Chris laughed ; `` <<target>> crust went a very short distance , and I feel game for at least a good-sized loaf . ''::::that
Although he said good-bye to his friend cheerfully , Chris felt more down-hearted than he had done since he had said farewell to his <<target>> more than two months before , as Sankey disappeared in the darkness , leaving him sitting among some bushes close to the road .::::mother
But do n't worry about me ; if I am caught , I have no doubt sooner or later I shall <<target>> them the slip again , but I do n't think there is any real occasion for you to bother .::::give
Unless by some unlucky fluke , I am <<target>> to get through all right . ''::::safe
Then with a wave of his hand <<target>> started confidently along the road .::::he
He met no one until he <<target>> close to the town .::::was
The first thing he had determined upon was <<target>> get hold of a hat somehow .::::to
`` Of course they have all been plundered , '' he said to himself ; `` but if I only had a light I have no <<target>> I should be able to find an old hat somewhere among the rubbish , but in the dark there is no chance whatever . ''::::doubt
Presently he saw a light in a window <<target>> a detached house of some size .::::in
He made his way noiselessly <<target>> and looked in .::::up
A party of five or six Boers <<target>> sitting smoking round a table .::::were
It is a beastly custom these Boers have of wearing their hats indoors as well as <<target>> , still there are almost sure to be some spare ones in the hall .::::out
A Boer out on the veldt would not be likely to possess more than the hat he wears , but a <<target>> living in such a house as this would be safe to have a variety for different sorts of weather .::::fellow
At any rate I <<target>> try . ''::::must
He took off his boots , and then stole up <<target>> the front door and turned the handle noiselessly .::::to
To his great delight he saw that four or five hats of different shapes and materials were <<target>> there , and a heap of long warm coats were thrown together on a bench .::::hanging
Looking round still more closely he saw five or six rifles in the <<target>> by the door , and to these were hanging as many bandoliers .::::corner
He first took down two felt hats of different sizes , and picked out two of the coats ; then , with great care to avoid any noise , he took two rifles with their bandoliers from the corner and crept out through the door , which he <<target>> behind him carefully ; for if they found it open the Boers might look round and discover that some of their goods were missing , whereas any one of them coming casually out , even with a light , would not be likely to notice it .::::closed
He put on one of the bandoliers , then a coat , and then slung one of the rifles behind him ; then , after putting on <<target>> boots he went out with the other articles and hid them inside the gate of an evidently deserted house a hundred yards from the other .::::his
He felt sure that even when the loss was discovered <<target>> would be no great search made for the thief .::::there
It would be supposed that some passing Kaffir had come in and stolen the things , and they <<target>> consider that , until the following morning , it would be useless to look for him .::::would
Feeling now perfectly confident that he could pass <<target>> , he entered the principal street .::::unsuspected
Here there were a good many Boers about , <<target>> none paid the slightest attention to him .::::but
Presently he came to a <<target>> that was still open .::::store
The owner was <<target>> course Dutch .::::of
He had been a pronounced loyalist when Sankey was last in Dundee , <<target>> had evidently thought it prudent to change sides when the British left .::::but
Sankey had been in the shop twice with Willesden , and had found the man very civil , and , <<target>> he thought , an honest fellow , but with so much at stake he dared not trust him now .::::as
Food he must have , that was certain , but if he had to obtain <<target>> by threats , he must do it at one of the outlying houses .::::it
It would be dangerous anyhow , for , though he could frighten a man into giving <<target>> what he required , he could not prevent him from giving the alarm afterwards .::::him
While he was looking on a mounted <<target>> stopped at the shop door .::::boer
He dismounted at once , and lifted <<target>> large bundle from his saddle .::::a
he said to <<target>> shopkeeper .::::the
I picked up some loot at <<target>> house that had been deserted .::::a
Here are twenty bottles of wine and a lot <<target>> tea -- I do n't know how much .::::of
There was a chest half-full , and <<target>> emptied it into a cloth .::::i
What will you give <<target>> for them ?::::me
I am riding <<target>> to Volksrust .::::home
I want three loaves and a couple of bottles <<target>> dop [ Footnote : The common country spirit .::::of
] , and the <<target>> in money . ''::::rest
The bargaining lasted for some minutes , the storekeeper saying that the wine was of no use to him , for no Boer ever spent money on <<target>> ; the tea of course was worth money , but he had now a large stock on hand , and could give but little for it .::::wine
However , the bargain <<target>> at last struck .::::was
The Boer brought out the bread and two bottles of spirits and placed them in <<target>> saddle- bag , then he went back into the shop to get the money .::::his
He had gone but a few steps when he heard <<target>> loud exclamation followed by a torrent of Dutch oaths .::::a
He stood up for a moment in a doorway , and heard the sound of heavy feet running <<target>> the street he had left , with loud shouts to stop a thief who had robbed him .::::along
The instant that he had passed Sankey walked on again , <<target>> in five minutes was in the outskirts of the town .::::and
He made his way to the place where he had hidden the other things , and taking them <<target>> , walked briskly on until he came to the bushes where his friend was anxiously expecting him .::::up
As he uttered his <<target>> Chris sprang out .::::name
`` I had not even begun <<target>> expect you back , Sankey .::::to
I see that you have got on <<target>> hat and a coat . ''::::another
`` That is only <<target>> part of it .::::a
I have got three loaves and two bottles of dop , and a coat and a hat for you , and <<target>> rifle and ammunition , as well as clothes for myself and the gun that you see over my shoulder . ''::::a
`` But how on earth did <<target>> do it , Sankey ? ''::::you
`` Honestly , my dear <<target>> , perfectly honestly .::::chris
The rifles and clothes were fairly spoils of war , the loaves and spirits were stolen from a thief , which I <<target>> to be a good action ; but let us go on , I will tell you about it as we walk .::::consider

Now I will put the sling <<target>> the rifle over your shoulder .::::of
There you are , complete , <<target>> Boer of the first water !::::a
I will carry the <<target>> and the bread .::::bottles
Now , let 's <<target>> going on . ''::::be
Then he told Chris how he had obtained his spoil , and they both had a hearty laugh over the <<target>> of the enraged Dutchman rushing down the street shouting for the eatables of which he had been bereaved .::::thought
`` It was splendidly <<target>> , Sankey .::::managed
I shall have to appoint you <<target>> caterer instead of Willesden .::::as
He pays honestly for all he wants for the mess , but I see that if we entrust <<target>> charge to you , we shall not have to draw for a farthing upon our treasure chest .::::the
And how is your <<target>> feeling ? ''::::arm
`` I have almost forgotten that I <<target>> an arm , '' Sankey said .::::have
`` I suppose the excitement of the <<target>> drove out the rheumatics . ''::::thing
`` We might have some <<target>> , '' Chris suggested .::::supper
`` No , no , we must <<target>> till we can get water .::::wait
I ca n't take <<target>> neat . ''::::dop
`` But how are you going to mix <<target>> when you do get water ? ''::::it
`` Well , I suppose we shall be reduced to taking a mouthful of <<target>> poison , and then a long drink of water to dilute it .::::this
We shall not have very far to go , because , if you remember , <<target>> crossed a little stream three or four miles after we rode out from Dundee .::::we
I am as hungry as a hunter , but it would destroy all the pleasure of <<target>> banquet if we had to munch dry bread with nothing to wash it down . ''::::the
After walking two miles farther they came upon the stream and going fifty yards up it , so <<target>> to run no risk of being disturbed , they sat down and enjoyed a hearty meal .::::as
`` It is almost a pity that you did not commandeer two ponies and saddles while you were about <<target>> , '' Chris laughed , as they set off again feeling all the better for their meal .::::it
`` We only want that <<target>> complete our outfit . ''::::to
`` You should have mentioned it <<target>> I started , Chris .::::before
There is no saying what I might not have done ; and really , without joking , <<target>> pony is one of the easiest things going to steal when there are Boers about .::::a
They always leave them standing just where they dismount , and will be in a <<target>> or a drinking-place for an hour at a time without attending to them . ''::::store
`` It is not the difficulty , but the risk ; for even if a <<target>> gets off with a pony , he is almost sure to be hunted down .::::thief
It is regarded as a sort of offence against the community , and a man , whether a native or <<target>> mean white , would get a very short shrift if he were caught on a stolen horse . ''::::a
`` Yes , <<target>> know .::::i
Still , for all that , if I could come upon a saddled pony , and there was a chance <<target>> getting off with it , I should take it without hesitation as a fair spoil of war . ''::::of
`` Yes , so should I , for the betting would be very strongly against our running across its <<target>> ; and in the next place , it would greatly increase our chance of getting safely through .::::owner
It is the fact of our being <<target>> foot that will attract attention .::::on
We could walk about a camp full of Boers without anyone noticing it , but to <<target>> into the camp would seem so extraordinary , that we should be questioned at once .::::walk

`` There I agree with you ; and I do think that when we get to Helpmakaar , which we can do to-morrow <<target>> if we make a good long march to-night , we had better see if we ca n't appropriate a couple of ponies .::::evening
We can walk boldly into the place , <<target>> no one would notice we were new-comers .::::and
There are sure to be ponies standing about , and it <<target>> be hard if we can not bag a couple .::::will
Then we can ride by the road south from there to Greytown , and after crossing the Tugela , strike off by the place where we <<target>> the fight near Umbala mountain , which would be a good landmark for us , and from there follow our old line back to Estcourt .::::had
They made a long journey that night , slept within seven or <<target>> miles of Helpmakaar , and started late in the afternoon .::::eight
When near the town they left the main road , passed through some fields , and came into <<target>> place that way , as had they entered by the road they were likely to be questioned .::::the
Once in the little town , <<target>> walked about at their ease .::::they
It did not seem that there were any great number of Boers there , but the town was well within the district <<target>> by them , and such loyalists as remained were sure to be keeping as much as possible without their houses .::::held
In front of the principal inn were nearly a score of Boer ponies , but the lads considered it would be altogether too risky to <<target>> to take a couple of these , as their owners might issue out while they were doing it ; however , they stood watching .::::attempt
`` If we had taken a couple of ponies at first , '' Sankey said <<target>> , `` we might have been two miles away by this time . ''::::savagely
`` Yes ; I do n't know <<target>> it is too late now .::::that
Wait till they strike up another song with a chorus , none of them are likely to leave <<target>> room while that is going on , and it will drown the sound of hoofs . ''::::the
There were few people about in the streets ; and even had anyone passed as <<target>> were mounting , he could not tell that they were not the legitimate owners .::::they
`` If anyone should come out , '' Chris <<target>> , `` do n't try to ride away .::::said
We should have the whole lot after us in a minute , and <<target>> is not likely we should have got hold of the fastest ponies .::::it
Besides , they would shoot <<target>> before we got far .::::us
So if anyone does come out and raises an alarm , jump off at once and <<target>> round the nearest corner , and then into the first garden we come to .::::run
We should be in one before they could come <<target>> , mount their ponies , and give chase .::::out
Once among the gardens <<target>> should be safe .::::we
If the man who comes out does not shout we would <<target>> no attention to him , but ride away quietly .::::pay
If the ponies do n't happen to belong to him or some friend of his , he would not be likely to <<target>> , for he would suppose that we were two of the party who had left the place without his noticing them .::::interfere
At that moment another <<target>> was struck up .::::song
If anyone comes out and sees us mounting he will take <<target>> for the two men who have just ridden off . ''::::us
Then they strolled leisurely across the street , took the reins of two of the ponies , sprang into the <<target>> , and started at a walk , which , twenty yards farther , was quickened into a trot .::::saddles
The two men had fortunately <<target>> in the other direction .::::gone
`` Now we are Boers all over , '' Chris said exultantly ; `` but there is <<target>> thing , Sankey , we must be careful not to go near any solitary farmhouse .::::one
There must still be some loyal men left in these parts , and if we fell in with <<target>> small party of them the temptation to pay off what they have suffered might be irresistible . ''::::a
`` Yes , Chris ; but they certainly would not shoot unless certain of bringing us both down , <<target>> if one escaped , he would return with a party strong enough to wipe them out altogether .::::for
However , we need not trouble about that for the present , though no doubt <<target>> will be well to be careful when we are once across the Tugela . ''::::it
`` Well , we shall be there long before morning ; <<target>> is not more than seven- or eight-and-twenty miles . ''::::it
They rode fast , for it was possible that when the loss of the ponies was discovered someone who might have noticed them <<target>> down the street might set the Boers on the track , and in that case they would certainly be hotly pursued .::::go
The ponies , however , turned out to be good animals , and as the lads were at least a couple of stones lighter <<target>> the average Boer , they could not be overtaken unless some of the ponies happened to be a good deal better than these .::::than
After riding at full speed for eight or nine miles , they <<target>> into a walk , stopping every few minutes to listen .::::broke
So sometimes cantering sometimes walking , they reached the <<target>> at about one o'clock in the morning .::::river
On the opposite bank stood the <<target>> village of Tugela Ferry .::::little
Here there was a drift , and there was no occasion to <<target>> the ferry-boat except when the river was swollen by rain .::::use
It now reached only just up to the ponies ' bellies ; they therefore crossed without the least difficulty , and <<target>> passing through the village , left the road , and struck off across the country to the south- west .::::after
When four or five miles away they halted at a donga , and leading the ponies <<target>> , turned them loose to feed , ate their supper , and were soon asleep .::::down
They kept a sharp look-out from every eminence , and once or twice saw <<target>> of mounted men in the distance and made detours to avoid them .::::parties
So far as they were aware , <<target>> , they were not observed .::::however
On an eminence about a mile in front <<target>> them they saw a solitary horseman .::::of
`` That is evidently one of <<target>> scouts , '' Chris said .::::our
`` I dare say there is a <<target>> of them somewhere behind him .::::party
If I am not mistaken I can see two or three <<target>> against the sky-line -- they are either heads or stones .::::heads
Two or three minutes later Sankey said , `` Those <<target>> black spots have gone , so they were heads .::::little
I dare say they are wondering who we are , and put us down either as Boers or <<target>> loyal farmers , though there can not be many of them left in this district . ''::::as
Presently from behind the foot of <<target>> hill six horsemen dashed out .::::the
The lads had already taken the precaution of taking <<target>> their hats and putting on forage-caps again .::::off
`` It is always better to <<target>> accidents , '' Chris said .::::avoid
`` It would have been awkward if they had begun to shoot before <<target>> to ask questions , especially as we could not shoot back .::::waiting
They are Colonials ; one can see that by their looped-up hats , which are <<target>> good deal more becoming than those hideous khaki helmets of our men . ''::::a
The horsemen had unslung their guns , but seeing that the strangers had their rifles still slung behind <<target>> with apparently no intention of firing , they dropped into a canter until they met the lads .::::them
`` Who are <<target>> ? ''::::you
`` Do you <<target>> ? ''::::surrender
We belong to the Maritzburg Scouts , and were taken prisoners , being both wounded , eight <<target>> nine days ago ; and , as you see , we have got away . ''::::or
Will you please tell us what has <<target>> place since we left ? ''::::taken
`` That , I think had better be <<target>> , '' the officer said dryly .::::deferred
`` We do n't tell <<target>> news to strangers . ''::::our
`` It is evident that you are not Dutch , '' the officer went on ; but there is more than one renegade Englishman fighting <<target>> the Boers , and except for your caps you certainly look as if you belonged to the other side rather than to ours . ''::::among
`` Yes , they are Boer coats , Boer <<target>> , and Boer guns , '' Chris said .::::ponies
`` We have taken the liberty of borrowing <<target>> as they borrowed our guns and field-glasses .::::them
Whether they borrowed our horses we shall <<target>> know till we get back .::::not

Who is at <<target>> now ?::::estcourt
Ah , by the way , we are sure to <<target>> some officers in the hospital who know us . ''::::find
The officer by this time began to feel that the account Chris had given him of himself was correct , and when <<target>> arrived at Estcourt it was rather as a matter of form than anything else that he accompanied him to the hospital .::::they
Upon enquiry Chris found that among the wounded there was one <<target>> the naval officers he had travelled with from Durban .::::of
Upon the surgeon in charge being told that he wished to <<target>> him , he was allowed to enter with the officer .::::see
The wounded man at <<target>> recognized him .::::once

`` No ; I am very sorry to find you here , <<target>> , but I am glad to see you are getting better .::::devereux

`` There is no <<target>> about that .::::doubt
Why , where have you been <<target>> be taken prisoner ? ''::::to
`` Oh , it <<target>> a fair capture .::::was
I was with one of my section caught while out scouting , and have got away in Boer attire , and as we were riding in <<target>> met this officer 's party some five miles out , and not unnaturally they took us for the real thing instead of masqueraders . ''::::we
`` I can assure you that King is <<target>> right , '' the sailor said .::::all
`` He came up in the train with <<target>> of his party from Durban . ''::::three
`` Thank you , '' the <<target>> said with a smile .::::officer
`` I am perfectly satisfied , and was <<target>> so before I came in here .::::nearly
Well , I wish you good-day , sir , and hope we may <<target>> again , '' and shaking hands with Chris he left the tent .::::meet
Chris remained chatting for a few <<target>> more with the sailor .::::minutes
`` I suppose there is no great <<target>> of getting a bed here ? ''::::chance
he said , as <<target>> rose to go .::::he
`` We have had two pretty long days ' ride , <<target>> I do n't care about going on to Chieveley . ''::::and
`` Not a chance in the <<target>> , I should think . ''::::world
`` Well , it <<target>> not matter much .::::does
We have been sleeping in the open for the past <<target>> nights , and once more will make no difference .::::five
`` Devereux tells me that there is a big movement going on , <<target>> that a severe fight is expected in a day or two .::::and
You know , they say that it <<target>> comparatively flat that way . ''::::is
They got rid of their long coats and fastened them to their saddles ; <<target>> led their ponies to the station , and leaving them outside entered .::::then
An enterprising store-keeper had opened a refreshment stall for the benefit of the troops passing through , <<target>> officers coming down from the front to look after stores or to visit friends in hospital .::::or
`` Yes ; they did not <<target>> us a penny . ''::::leave
`` There is my purse with my watch in that <<target>> pocket over my bed , '' he said .::::little
`` You must let me lend you a <<target>> till I see you again . ''::::sovereign
And Chris had thankfully <<target>> the money .::::taken
They now had what to them was a gorgeous feast ; <<target>> soup , cold ham , and a bottle of wine .::::some
They gave what little remains they had of bread to the ponies , and then led them a quarter of <<target>> mile out of the town and camped out with them there , the Boer coats coming in very useful .::::a
The next morning they started at daybreak , and arrived at their <<target>> at Chieveley just as their friends were sitting down to breakfast .::::camp
They were received with a shout of welcome , <<target>> a torrent of questions was poured upon them .::::and
`` I will leave Sankey to tell you <<target>> about it , '' Chris said .::::all
`` I must go and report myself to Brookfield and <<target>> our names struck off the list of missing .::::get
I shall not be <<target>> minutes away . ''::::five
The captain received Chris as heartily , though not <<target>> noisily , as his comrades had done .::::so
`` When we came back to the point where you left us , and did not find <<target>> there , we thought there might be some mistake , and that you had ridden on .::::you
We picked up all the others , but were not uneasy until <<target>> got into camp , and found that you did not return .::::we
Then two of your friends took fresh horses and rode <<target>> again , taking two of your blacks with them .::::out
Then they went on till they saw <<target>> river in front of them .::::the
The blacks traced your footsteps along near the bank till they came to a spot where there <<target>> evidently a drift , as a road was cut down to the water on both sides .::::was
They then crawled along till they <<target>> look down into the road .::::could
They were some time away , and returned with the news that they had seen below them on the road a patch of blood and <<target>> mark of a body in the mud , another step they said had gone down to the water , and had not come back .::::the
Crawling along by the edge of the <<target>> they found some empty cartridges .::::bank
They said whoever had been up there had crawled once or twice to the edge above the sunken road where the <<target>> was lying , and that he had then gone back from the river and afterwards down into the road .::::other
A little farther there seemed to have been a fall , and then two men with big feet came to the spot , and , they asserted , carried the one who had fallen there down to the other ; <<target>> they could not see what had happened then , for it was evident that the Boers were in force on the other side of the river , and they dared not go down farther to examine the tracks .::::but
Enough had been seen , however , to <<target>> that you must both have been wounded .::::show
It was pretty certain that you had not been killed , for if so <<target>> Boers would not have troubled to carry your bodies across the drift .::::the
Now , Chris , let <<target>> hear your story . ''::::us
`` If you do n't mind , Captain Brookfield , '' Chris said with <<target>> smile , `` I will put off telling it for another half-hour .::::a
The fact is , breakfast is ready , and I have only had one <<target>> meal since I went away , and that was yesterday at Estcourt . ''::::square
`` I breakfasted half an hour before you came in , and <<target>> that it was possible that you had not done so . ''::::forgot
It was a full half-hour before Chris returned , and when he did so he left Sankey still telling the story of their adventures , which had <<target>> very little progress , as he had declared that he could not enjoy his breakfast if he was obliged to keep on talking all the time .::::made
When Chris , on his part , had told <<target>> story to Captain Brookfield , the latter said :::::the
`` I ca n't say that I am altogether surprised to see you back , though I certainly did not expect you for a long time , for I felt sure that if you and Sankey were not seriously wounded you would manage to give them <<target>> slip before you got to Pretoria ; and I thought we should hear the first news of you at Durban , for it would be shorter and easier for you to make your way down again to Lorenzo Marques than to follow this line .

`` We should certainly have gone that way if we had not escaped until we were near Pretoria , but it was a <<target>> deal easier to slip away from the waggons than it would have been if we had been once put into the train .::::great
I hope , sir , we have not been returned as missing , <<target>> it will have frightened our mothers terribly if we have been . ''::::for
`` No ; I thought that there was no occasion to <<target>> your names until you had been away for a month .::::give
If you were not heard of by that time , I <<target>> consider it certain that you were dead or at Pretoria .::::should

It is supposed to be a secret as to the precise <<target>> , but orders have been privately circulated this morning .::::position
Dundonald with the regular cavalry , the Natal Horse , and the South African Light Horse went on four days ago , with one or two other colonial corps , and <<target>> Springfield , and the baggage train followed them ; and after occupying the place , instead of waiting for infantry to come up , he moved on to a river .::::occupied
Some of his men , with extraordinary pluck , swam across and <<target>> to bring the ferry-boat over under a very heavy fire .::::managed
Then a number of them crossed , scattered the Boers like chaff , and took possession <<target>> a rough hill called Swartz Kop , and held it till support came up .::::of
It was a capitally managed affair , and one can not <<target>> regret that the same care was not shown at Hlangwane .::::but
We are to go on this afternoon , but as we are not in Dundonald 's brigade I expect <<target>> our duty will be , as it was in the last fight , to guard the baggage . ''::::that

I am not sure that the whole <<target>> is not going that way .::::force
It would be a grand thing if it could be done ; but I doubt whether the train could carry enough stores , for it would be a <<target>> way round , and we should probably have to fight two or three times at least , and it might take us five or six days . ''::::long

By the way , did you hear of the Boer <<target>> on Ladysmith on the night of the 6th ? ''::::attack

It lasted four hours , and there was no <<target>> that the Boers were making a determined attack .::::doubt
Everyone wondered that we did not <<target>> once make a diversion .::::at

Our guns were taken a long way down , and at six o'clock their trenches were bombarded ; then it came <<target>> to rain , and the Boers ceased to fire , and at seven o'clock our men turned into camp .::::on

Chris asked anxiously , `` for I know the place has <<target>> fallen or we should have heard of it . ''::::not

However , they had hard work to do it , for the heliograph flashed a signal at about nine o'clock <<target>> the morning to say that they had so far beaten off the enemy , but were much pressed .::::in

`` Yes , we must do the Boers the justice <<target>> say that they are not afraid of hard work .::::to
Ever since they first came here they have been at <<target>> everywhere every day in the week , including Sundays .::::work

We were also taught that strong positions held by steady troops armed with <<target>> guns and supported by good artillery were absolutely impregnable against direct attack .::::magazine
I grant that Dundee and Elandslaagte , and Belmont and Enslin on the other side , seemed to contradict that idea , but our experience here is <<target>> the other way ; and if we keep on knocking our heads against those hills I suppose the axiom is likely to be finally confirmed . ''::::all

`` Yes , fresh batches of waggons are going on , and we are to escort them , and if we reach Springfield by to-morrow night we may think ourselves lucky , for some of the officers who went with the first lot have come back , and say that the roads are simply awful -- there are dongas to be <<target>> where the waggons sink up to their axles -- and that at one point ninety oxen were fastened to a single waggon and could not pull it out from a hole in which it was sunk , and there it would be now if one of the Woolwich traction engines had n't got hold of it and drawn it out .::::passed
They are doing splendid work , and if the War Office authorities can but take a lesson to heart , <<target>> next war we go into we shall have five hundred of them and not a single transport animal .::::the
They would cost money , no doubt , but they would eat nothing and drink nothing ; they would only require to be oiled and cleaned occasionally <<target>> keep them in order , and when they were wanted they would do the work without our having to hunt the world over for transport animals .::::to
They would save their cost in one war ; there would be a thousand drivers and stokers instead of twenty thousand camp followers ; it would not matter whether the country was burnt up <<target>> or deep in grass , they would drag their fuel with them ; and would save the artillery horses by dragging the guns till they were in the neighbourhood of an enemy .::::dry

Spearman 's Hill , which was generally called Mount Alice , was a very important position , and here the naval guns were placed , their fire commanding the greater <<target>> of the hills on the other side of the Tugela , and also Potgieter 's Drift , where it was intended the passage of the river should be made .::::portion
Swartz Kop was a less important position , though it also dominated a wide extent of country ; but as ridges on the other side covered some important points from its fire , Mount Alice was selected as the <<target>> for the naval battery , and also for the signallers , as from here a direct communication could be kept up by heliograph and flash- light with one of the hills held by the defenders of Ladysmith .::::position

As far as they could see , no serious opposition was being offered ; they could , however , in the intervals of silence of the guns , hear a dropping musketry fire <<target>> that direction , and a few rounds of shot from Warren 's field-guns , but it was evident that only a small party of the enemy could be disputing the passage .::::in

Later Sir Charles Warren summoned all the officers commanding corps , and pointed out that there was not sufficient food remaining to allow of the wide circuit by Acton Homes to be carried out , and gave his opinion that now they had won so much <<target>> , it was better to continue to advance by the shorter line on which they were pushing , but that in order to do this it was necessary that Spion Kop , whose fire would take them in the rear , should be captured .::::ground

Then a Boer challenged them , <<target>> directly fired his rifle .::::and

As soon as the Boers had gone , the troops set to work to construct breastworks <<target>> hold the spot they had gained against any attempts of the Boers to recapture .::::to
The ground was too rocky for digging , and the stones that were scattered thickly about were used for <<target>> purpose ; but long before the breastwork could be completed a dropping fire was opened by the enemy .::::the
The morning was gray and misty , and <<target>> clouds hung heavily on the hilltop .::::the
As these cleared off slowly , it could be seen that the position was less favourable than it had seemed , for the flat <<target>> extended some distance beyond the point they had entrenched , and from the rocks and low ridges a hot fire broke out .::::crest
By six o'clock the scattered fire had grown into a continuous roar , the <<target>> occupying not only the nek itself , but the flanks of the hill .::::boers
Several times our men made rushes to endeavour to clear off the foe , but these <<target>> too costly , and they were now lying or kneeling behind the unfinished barricade .::::proved
In a very short time the clouds had lifted sufficiently for the Boer artillery to discover the exact position , and from the <<target>> on three sides a terrible fire of shot and shell , from cannon great and small and machine-guns , rained upon them .::::hills
Again and again parties of men started to their feet and dashed <<target>> to drive the hidden Boers facing them from their hiding-places .::::forward
Sometimes they succeeded for a time , but their numbers thinned <<target>> fast that the survivors were forced to fall back again .::::so
To add to the horror of the situation , the shot from our own guns also fell among the defenders , the <<target>> commanding the batteries not having been informed of the intention to occupy the hill , and knowing nothing of the situation .::::officers
At ten o'clock General Woodgate was mortally wounded by the fragment of a shell <<target>> struck him in the eye , and Colonel Crofton took the command .::::that

It was now hoped that <<target>> was well there .::::all
Unfortunately , neither Buller nor Warren was able to give his undivided attention to the struggle on the mountain , <<target>> Lyttleton 's brigade had advanced before daybreak against the eastern slopes of the hills running north from Spion Kop .::::for
They advanced briskly , their Maxims clearing out the Boers , from whose fire they suffered but little ; but they sustained some loss from the shell fire <<target>> Mount Alice , the sailors having been as uninformed of the advance the brigade were to make as they were of the capture of Spion Kop .::::from

Had there been guns on Spion Kop the object of the movement would have been attained , and the advance by direct road on Ladysmith have become a possibility ; <<target>> no guns had reached the summit , and the troops there were so far from being able to render assistance that they were with difficulty maintaining their desperate resistance .::::but
The fire slackened at this point to some extent in the afternoon , no farther advance <<target>> attempted , but it raged as hotly as ever on the summit of Spion Kop .::::being
He stated that unless the artillery could silence the enemy 's <<target>> the troops could not support another day 's shelling .::::guns
In the evening two naval twelve-pounders , the R. A. mountain battery , and one thousand <<target>> hundred men as reliefs , started to ascend the hill and to strengthen the entrenchments .::::two
On the way up they met Colonel Thorneycroft and the rest of the force coming down , that officer , who had <<target>> splendid gallantry throughout the day , having decided on his own responsibility that the position could not be longer held .::::displayed
Strangely enough , the news of the retirement was not communicated to General Buller , who , after reporting in his despatches written <<target>> morning that Spion Kop was firmly held , was riding to the front when he for the first time learned the news .::::next
Altogether it was a day of strange blunders , redeemed <<target>> by the splendid bravery of the troops engaged .::::only
The news came as a heavy blow to the army , but it was supposed that a fresh attempt would be made to <<target>> the position by ascending the northern spurs that had been carried and held for a time by the two rifle battalions .::::capture
But while soldiers think only of the chances of battle , and burn to engage the enemy , <<target>> feeling only accentuated by previous failures , generals in command have to take other matters into consideration .::::a
They may feel that they may conquer in the <<target>> fight , but what is to follow ?::::next
In this case the chances of success would be smaller than before , the loss <<target>> serious , for the Boers from all parts had united to oppose us .::::more
Many of the cannon had been brought over <<target>> the positions from which Ladysmith was bombarded .::::from
The advantage of surprise gained by the long march from Chieveley had been lost ; more serious still was it that a large proportion of the provisions , brought at the cost of so much labour <<target>> exhaustion of the transport animals , was consumed , and what remained would be insufficient had fresh battles to be fought to capture the positions , one behind another , held by the Boers .::::and
General Buller was the last man to retire as <<target>> as there was a hope of success .::::long
He knew that not only at home , but all over the civilized world , men were anxiously awaiting the news of his second attempt to relieve Ladysmith , <<target>> it must have been hard indeed for him to have to acknowledge a second reverse ; but in spite of this he sternly determined to fall back .::::and
The movement was admirably executed ; every horse , waggon , gun , and soldier was taken safely across the Tugela without <<target>> by the Boers , a fact that showed how deeply they had been impressed with the valour of our soldiers .::::hindrance
Sullenly and angrily the <<target>> marched away .::::troops

To them the necessities of the situation were as nothing ; to retreat seemed an acknowledgment <<target>> they had been beaten , a feeling that is seldom entertained by British soldiers .::::that
Their losses had been heavy , but there were still enough of them , they thought , for the work they <<target>> to do , and it was with a deep feeling of unmerited humiliation that they received the order to retire .::::had
The feeling , however , was not of long endurance , for two days later , when they had settled down in camp near the Tugela and round Spearman 's <<target>> , the general rode through the lines , congratulating the troops on the valour they had displayed , and promising them that ere long they would be in Ladysmith .::::farm

On coming in and out , as the men were muddy up to the knees , it was impossible to keep these even tolerably clean , <<target>> the discomfort of so many men crowded together and obliged to live , eat , and sleep in such confined quarters was very great indeed .::::and
The lads on the other hand , suffered from none of these inconveniences , and except that they could not <<target>> up , and could only sit upright in the middle of the tent , they were perfectly comfortable .::::stand

The lads had no occasion to feel dull , for they now knew many officers in the line regiments , and among the Colonial troops , as well as the naval brigade ; <<target>> `` Brookfield 's boys '' , as they were generally called , were always welcome , and it was seldom that more than half of them dined in their own camp .::::and

The men were all now in high spirits , for it was <<target>> that in a day or two another attack would be made .::::certain
On Sunday , February 4th , it was known <<target>> the move would commence the next day .::::that
General Buller 's plan was to make a strong feint against Brakfontein , the highest hill of the ridge connected with the Spion Kop range , while the real attack was to be delivered against an isolated hill named Vaal <<target>> , which , as viewed from Swartz Kop and Mount Alice , seemed to be the key to the whole position , and it was thought that its possession would open the way for a direct advance to Ladysmith .::::krantz
All was now in readiness for the attack , and the sailors had with steel hawsers , <<target>> the aid of the troops , got four more naval guns on to Swartz Kop .::::and
Before daybreak the troops <<target>> ready to advance .::::were
The regular cavalry were near the base of Swartz Kop , while all <<target>> Colonial Horse , under Lord Dundonald , were near Potgieter 's Drift .::::the
At six o'clock the cavalry went forward , but not far , for the morning was so misty that the artillery could not make out the Boer positions <<target>> an hour later , when a tremendous fire was opened from Mount Alice , Swartz Kop , and guns placed on a lower spur of Spion Kop .::::until
While this was going on , a bridge <<target>> thrown by the Engineers across another drift .::::was
Major-general Wynne led the Lancashire brigade <<target>> the direction of Brakfontein .::::in
They went forward in skirmishing order , supported by five field batteries and the howitzer battery , all of which kept up an incessant fire of lyddite , shell , and shot against <<target>> Boer position , their fire being guided by an engineer officer in a balloon , who was able from a lofty altitude to signal where the Boers were clustering most thickly .::::the
When another bridge had been completed General Lyttleton advanced with his brigade across it , and as the feint against Brakfontein had succeeded in gathering the greater portion of the Boers at the spot they supposed to <<target>> most in danger , the Lancashire brigade was withdrawn , retiring in excellent order , the movement being covered by an incessant firing of the guns with them , which completely dominated those of the Boers .::::be
Lyttleton 's brigade now pressed forward under a storm of musketry and shell from machine <<target>> other guns , which were answered even more thunderously by the British artillery .::::and
The din was tremendous -- greater even <<target>> any that had been previously heard .::::than
It seemed impossible that men could live for <<target>> moment in such a storm of missiles .::::a
But they pressed on unfalteringly , and the batteries with them as steadily <<target>> their fire , though shells fell continually round and among them .::::maintained
The batteries that had gone out with the Lancashire Brigade now directed their fire <<target>> Vaal Krantz , having moved across from Brakfontein under a tremendous fire .::::against
One of the waggons lost all its horses ; but the five artillerymen <<target>> it manned the wheels and brought it safely out of fire .::::with
At three o'clock Lyttleton 's brigade advanced in earnest , and dashed forward at the double against Vaal <<target>> , heedless of the rifle fire from the hills on both flanks and from the front .::::krantz
The defenders soon lost courage , as they saw the Durhams and 3rd King 's Royal Rifles dashing up <<target>> hill with bayonets fixed , and scarce two hundred of them remained till the British gained the crest .::::the
These were speedily <<target>> or bayoneted .::::scattered
The position when won was found to be unsatisfactory , for it was dominated by a hill beyond , which could <<target>> be seen from the British look-out stations , and the cannon of Spion Kop were able to sweep the plateau .::::not
At one time the Boers gathered and made an effort to retake the hill , but two more battalions <<target>> sent up to reinforce the defenders , and the enemy were driven back and the fire gradually languished .::::were
The troops remained on the ground <<target>> had won during the night .::::they
The baggage waggons were all collected by the river in readiness to advance ; but the way was not yet sufficiently cleared <<target>> them , and the Boer guns on Brakfontein and Spion Kop commanded the road which they would have to traverse .::::for
It was evident to all that no advance was possible until <<target>> guns on these heights had been silenced or captured .::::the
For the same reason the two <<target>> of cavalry had remained inactive .::::brigades

General Hart pleaded to be allowed to make an attempt on Doornkloof with his brigade ; but , strongly <<target>> as that position was , it was deemed impossible that it could be captured by a single brigade .::::held
The original intention was that guns should be taken up on to Vaal Krantz , and that with their assistance a strong force would wheel round and take Doornkloof <<target>> the rear ; but owing to the discovery that the former hill was dominated from several points , it was found impracticable to carry the plan into execution .::::in
Orders were therefore given for the supply column , <<target>> had advanced some distance , to retire .::::which
As the movement was being carried out , the Boers kept up a heavy fire upon the waggons and on the hospital , which , relying upon the protection of the Red Cross flag , had advanced within range , but here , as upon <<target>> every occasion , the enemy paid no respect whatever to the Geneva emblem , although when , as once or twice happened , one of our shells fell near an ambulance of theirs , they had sent in indignant protests against our conduct .::::almost
All that night and the next day the movement to the rear continued , and not only were the infantry moved across the Tugela , but the guns on Swartz Kop <<target>> Mount Alice were removed , and orders were given for a general retirement to Springfield , a proof that the next attack would be made in an entirely different direction .::::and

We were going along a hollow with rising ground on either side when , <<target>> the slightest warning , a tremendous fire was opened from both flanks .::::without

The troops were strung out along the line of waggons ; numbers <<target>> shot down before a single musket was fired in defence .::::were
The main body , such as it was , fought stoutly , but as they could only catch an occasional glimpse of <<target>> heads of the enemy , while they were themselves altogether exposed , there could be but one end to it .::::the
A hundred and twenty men were killed or wounded in a few minutes , <<target>> to save the rest from a similar massacre the officer who commanded surrendered .::::and

I gained a little at first , but after two hours ' riding they were <<target>> the same distance behind as when they had first started on the chase .::::about

I had not ventured to go near a Boer farm , for fortunately I had shot a springbok , and was therefore under no trouble as to food ; but on the <<target>> day I had not come across water , and the heat was terrible , so I felt that whatever came of it I must go and ask for a drink .::::previous
I saw a farmhouse about nine in <<target>> morning and made for it .::::the
`` Who are <<target>> ? ''::::you
Of course I speak Dutch as well as English , <<target>> shouted back that I only wanted some water .::::and
`` 'Are you <<target>> Englishman ? '::::an

It was my turn now , and I fired <<target>> , and the two Boers rolled over .::::twice
I walked forward now ready to fire on an <<target>> , as there might be more of them .::::instant

I do n't want to hurt any of you , <<target>> if you attack me I must protect myself . '::::but
Though they cursed me again , they did not attempt to stop me , as I rather feared they would ; but I understood it when , <<target>> I had gone fifty yards , I heard a horse 's hoofs , and looking round saw a girl riding at full speed across the veldt .::::before
She had no doubt gone to fetch the men who <<target>> away or to the next farm to summon assistance .::::were
The draught of water had done me a world of good , and I soon broke into <<target>> run , though I did not conceal from myself that I was in a bad fix .::::a
Once out of sight of the farm I changed my course , and did so several times in the course of the next <<target>> hours ; then , on getting to the crest of high ground , I saw a river half a mile away .::::two
Before starting to walk down I looked round , and a little <<target>> a mile away could see a party of some fifteen Boers .::::over
I ran at full speed down the slope , and could see no other place where I could make a fight of it ; <<target>> many of the rivers have , like those here , steep banks , and I could at least sell my life dearly .::::but
It could only be for a time , for some of <<target>> Boers would cross the spruit and take me in rear .::::the
Still , there was nothing <<target>> to be done .::::else
`` When I reached the bank <<target>> gave a shout of satisfaction .::::i
The river was in flood ; there must have been rain up <<target>> the hills , and you know how quickly the streams rise .::::in
Unless the Boers knew of some very shallow place , there would be no crossing it ; for it <<target>> running like a mill- stream , and except at some waggon drift the banks were almost perpendicular .::::was
At any rate I could not hope to swim half across before the Boers <<target>> up , and so I must fight it out where I was .::::came
I had scarcely found a point where I could get a comfortable foothold on the bank , with <<target>> head just above the level , when the Boers appeared on the top of the hill .::::my
They stopped for a minute and then <<target>> up , and scattering rode forward .::::broke
They felt sure that I must have made for the river , <<target>> there was no other place where I could be concealed .::::as
When they came within a couple of hundred yards of it <<target>> dismounted , and three or four came forward on foot .::::they
When the nearest was within a <<target>> yards of me I fired .::::hundred
I sent a shot or two among them as they were consulting , with <<target>> result that they rode off three or four hundred yards farther back .::::the
They did not attempt to return my fire , for , except when I <<target>> my head for a moment , they could see nothing of me .::::raised
They doubtless learned from the women that I had a Colt 's rifle and a brace of revolvers , and <<target>> if they were to make a rush across the open not many of them were likely to reach me .::::that
After a talk two or three of them mounted their horses and rode so as to strike the river both above and <<target>> me , intending no doubt to cross if they found a place where there was a chance of doing so .::::below
I felt pretty sure that they would do nothing till it was dark , then they would crawl up and make a rush ; I was certain , <<target>> , that they would not give it up , as there were two of their number lying on the veldt besides the two at the farmhouse .::::anyhow
There was , however , more pluck in them than I had given them credit for , <<target>> about mid-day they began to advance , crawling along the ground as if stalking a quarry .::::for
The men who had gone out on horseback had all returned , but just <<target>> the others started crawling up three of them galloped away down stream .::::as
I pulled a stone as big as my head out of the clay of the bank and put <<target>> on the edge where my head had been , and then got down into the water .::::it

Laying my gun and pistols down on <<target>> ledge I felt about farther .::::a
At the top it went in nearly three feet , and was <<target>> at the back than it was at the water 's edge .::::higher
At any rate it afforded <<target>> good chance of safety .::::a
Holding the revolvers , the chamber of the rifle , and my ammunition above water , I stooped until I could get <<target>> the hole , which was but just wide enough for the purpose ; then I pushed myself back to the end .::::into
I found there was just height enough for <<target>> to sit with my mouth above water .::::me
The back sloped so that I had to dig my <<target>> into the clay to prevent myself from slipping forward .::::heels
I had noticed as I came along that the river was already falling , so <<target>> I had no fear of being drowned as long as I kept my position .::::that

There I sat <<target>> after hour .::::hour
I had at least the consolation of knowing what <<target>> state of fury the Boers must be in .::::a
They would have seen by my footsteps where I had entered <<target>> river , just below where I had been standing .::::the
No doubt they would have gone along the top of the bank to see if I had come out of the water again , and when they <<target>> their friends on horseback and heard that I had not swum down the river , they would have concluded that I must have been drowned .::::reached
Had I managed to cross , they would <<target>> seen me climb the opposite bank .::::have

It was about fifty yards wide , and I <<target>> fully half-way over before it reached my chin .::::was

Then I climbed the <<target>> and made off .::::bank
I saw nothing more of my pursuers , and three days later I arrived at Standerton , and remained there til <<target>> end of the war , for the gallant little town repulsed all attempts of the Boers to capture it . ''::::the

Now , will someone else <<target>> us a yarn ? ''::::give
Two days later all were settled at Chieveley again , and it was generally believed that the <<target>> attack would take place very shortly , and that it would probably be directed against Colenso .::::next
That evening a farmer <<target>> into camp .::::came
His horse had dropped <<target>> a mile away .::::dead
He stopped , as he passed through the tents of the <<target>> , and asked where he could find the general .::::scouts
Captain Brookfield , who heard the question , stepped out from <<target>> tent with Chris , to whom he had been talking .::::his
I thought the voice <<target>> familiar to me .::::was
`` I have ridden <<target>> to get help .::::in
The other day a raiding party of Boers came down through Inadi , and riding in between Dingley <<target>> and Botha 's Castle -- you know the hill -- swept off a quantity of cattle .::::dell

One of the farmers rode <<target>> Greytown for help .::::to
Most of the young men there had joined one or other of the <<target>> troops , but fifteen of us said that we could go out .::::colonial
It seemed that there were not more <<target>> some fifteen or twenty Boers .::::than
Well , I ca n't tell you all about it , for , as it <<target>> a matter of life and death , I have not a moment to lose .::::is
However , we came up to <<target>> north of Botha 's Castle .::::them
We had a <<target>> fight .::::sharp
Two of our men were killed and five <<target>> the Boers ; the rest rode off .::::of
We set to work to bunch all the cattle , and as we were <<target>> it we were attacked suddenly by a party sixty or seventy strong .::::at
The fellows that we had driven off had evidently <<target>> across them and brought them down upon us .::::come
We made a running fight , but our horses were not so fresh as theirs ; and seeing that they had the <<target>> of us we made for an empty farmhouse , and as they rode up we brought down several of them .::::speed
`` There was a wall round the yard , and <<target>> Boers drew off for a bit to consider .::::the
Then they dismounted and planted themselves round the house in such shelter as they could <<target>> within two or three hundred yards , and the affair began in earnest .::::find
The first day they kept up a heavy fire , to which we could make but little reply , for it was <<target>> death to lift a head above the wall or to show one 's self at a window even for a moment .::::certain
We lost three <<target>> that way .::::men
During the night they tried to carry the place , but we were all at the wall ; and had <<target>> best of it , as we had only to show our heads , while they were altogether exposed .::::the
There was not much firing next day , and it <<target>> evident that they meant to starve us out .::::was
There was not a scrap of food to be found in the place ; but fortunately <<target>> was a small thatched kraal inside the yard which gave some forage for the horses .::::there
The next day we killed <<target>> of them for food .::::one
`` That night we agreed that when the Boers saw that we did not surrender in a day or two they would be sure that we must be eating the horses , as any food we <<target>> with us must be exhausted , and they would then make a determined attack ; for we knew we had killed eight or ten of them , and that they would not go away .::::brought
So we decided that the only hope was for one of us to ride here ; we <<target>> up who should try to get through the Boers , and the lot fell upon me .::::tossed

We had agreed from the first that this would have to be done , and had given what scraps of bread we could spare to it ; besides which , they were <<target>> in fair condition , as the yard was strewn with rubbish , and some party of Boers had ripped up all the beds and straw mattresses and scattered the contents about .::::all

I had gone about two hundred yards when a <<target>> jumped up just in front of me .::::man
My rifle was ready , and before he could lift his <<target>> shot him , and then clapped spurs to nay horse .::::i
There was a tremendous hubbub ; shots were fired at random in all directions , <<target>> I doubt whether they could have seen me after I had gone fifty yards .::::but
I rode for a quarter of a mile <<target>> north , and then turned west .::::due
I had no fear of being overtaken , for although the Boers would all have their horses close , in readiness to mount if we should try to break out , I must have got a good quarter of a mile <<target>> , and they were not likely to keep up the chase long , as they could not tell which way I might have doubled , and if they pursued far , it would be in the direction of Greytown .::::start
It was about a seventy-mile ride , and as I started <<target>> twelve , I have done it in nine hours .::::about

`` I do n't suppose he will know of our having been away , sir ; he has plenty more serious things to think of than the numerical strength of your troop , and as the news of <<target>> skirmish some thirty miles north of Greytown is not likely to be reported in the papers , or at any rate to attract his attention , I do n't think you need trouble yourself on that score .::::a
Besides , if it was reported , it could only be said that one of the besieged party escaping , returned <<target>> a small body of volunteers he had collected ; and the name of the Maritzburg Scouts would not be mentioned .::::with

Besides , they have so <<target>> lines of retreat .::::many
There had been no pause in the work of preparation while they were talking , and the horses were <<target>> saddled , the food divided , the saddle- bags packed , and the blankets and waterproofs strapped on .::::now
Chris went across to <<target>> Brookfield 's tent .::::captain
`` We are all ready for <<target>> start , sir . ''::::a
The officer looked <<target>> his watch .::::at
`` It is three minutes under <<target>> half- hour , Chris .::::the
How much ammunition are you <<target>> with you ? ''::::taking
`` A hundred and fifty rounds each , sir , of which <<target>> do n't suppose we shall use above ten at the outside .::::i
Still , there is never any saying ; and if <<target>> should get besieged we shall want it all .::::we
Your horse is ready <<target>> you , Mr .::::for
`` And I am ready too , '' the farmer <<target>> , getting up from the table and stretching himself .::::said
`` I ought not <<target>> have sat down .::::to
I could ride as far as most at twenty , but I have not done <<target>> much for the last fifteen years , and I feel stiff in every limb .::::so
However , I shall be all right when I have gone a few miles , <<target>> that wash I had before breakfast has done me a world of good .::::and
Now , sir , I am ready , and whether we shall succeed or <<target>> , I thank you with all my heart for coming with me . ''::::not
`` Good-bye , <<target>> ! ''::::chris
`` I expect you will all turn up again , <<target>> bad pennies , before many days have gone . ''::::like
`` I hope so , <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::sir
`` I should be sorry to miss the end <<target>> after having seen it so far . ''::::here
When Chris went out with Captain Brookfield and the farmer , the lads had shaken hands with <<target>> their friends , and were standing by the side of their horses ready to mount .::::all
Jack and the two Zulus were <<target>> a few yards behind them .::::standing
Japhet had brought up <<target>> other spare horse .::::the
`` It is a nice piece of horse-flesh , '' <<target>> farmer said as he looked at it critically .::::the
`` Yes , it <<target>> bred by Duncan .::::was
We purchased pretty well the pick of <<target>> he brought down the country . ''::::those
`` That accounts <<target>> it .::::for
They are in good <<target>> , too . ''::::condition
`` Yes ; our horses all get two feeds of mealies a day , or , when it is wet , one feed of <<target>> and a hot mash made of mealie flour , besides what they can pick up , for we do n't draw horse rations .::::mealies
The lads all in a <<target>> swung into their saddles .::::second
`` Good-bye , lads , <<target>> good luck ! ''::::and
Captain Brookfield said ; and the men <<target>> by broke into a hearty cheer .::::standing
There was a strong suspicion that the <<target>> were not going down to Maritzburg .::::party
It was felt that they were not the sort <<target>> throw it up before Ladysmith was relieved .::::to
And their suspicions were heightened when they saw the <<target>> mount and ride by the side of Chris .::::farmer
one of the officers said , <<target>> they stood looking after them .::::as
`` Why should they have left two of their men here with some <<target>> their traps and stores if they had not been coming back ?::::of
They would naturally give <<target>> all away .::::them
Besides , I noticed that farmer come in on foot half an hour ago ; there was no talk of <<target>> leaving before he arrived , and he has gone off with them on one of their horses . ''::::their
`` All I know about it officially is that this morning Mr. King resigned in the name of himself and his party ; and as you know , I told you when they <<target>> joined us , they did so on the explicit understanding that they should be allowed to resign when they chose , and that provision was inserted when they were sworn in .

`` That is all <<target>> know officially ? ''::::you
If they are missed , and the question is asked me what <<target>> become of them , that is the answer I shall give .::::has
What else I know I must for <<target>> present keep to myself . ''::::the
`` I suppose we shall <<target>> them back soon ? ''::::see
`` Well , I consider that that <<target>> within the limits of possibility . ''::::is
`` I suppose that you have <<target>> no plan yet , Mr .::::formed
the farmer said , when <<target>> had left the camp .::::they
`` No ; my present idea is to <<target>> the line half-way down to Frere .::::follow
If we were to strike off towards the country at once , we should , <<target>> course , be noticed ; so I would rather get three miles on .::::of
You say it is <<target>> seventy miles ? ''::::about
`` Well , allowing for a halt , we can do it in <<target>> hours ; that would be just as it is getting dark .::::twelve
Of course we shall not show ourselves <<target>> they begin to attack the house .::::till
I hope we shall find your <<target>> still holding out . ''::::friends
`` I hope <<target>> indeed .::::so
You see , the Boers were quiet when I started , and I <<target>> hardly think that they would make an attack again after I left .::::should
They seemed to have settled down to starve us out ; but it is quite possible that now I have got away <<target>> will grow nervous lest I should bring help up , and are very likely to make another attempt this evening .::::they
They would be pretty sure to succeed this time , for there are only seven of us left there ; and though they could make a good <<target>> in daylight , they would have no real chance if the Boers went at them in earnest , which they are sure to do next time .::::fight
We agreed before I started that it would <<target>> do to try to defend the yard .::::not
After I left they were going to pile everything movable against the doors and windows and fight hard <<target>> keep the Boers out , and would then go upstairs and sell their lives dearly . ''::::to
`` How far are the <<target>> horses out ? ''::::boer
`` About five hundred yards <<target>> , in a dip .::::away
We know they always keep three or four men on guard there , <<target>> we have seen them come out of the hollow sometimes . ''::::for
`` And the cattle , have <<target>> driven them off yet ? ''::::they
`` Yes ; four of the Boers and twenty or thirty natives went straight <<target>> with them as soon as they had driven us into the farmhouse .::::on
I am afraid there is no use <<target>> of getting them back . ''::::thinking
`` It depends upon how far they <<target>> gone , '' Chris said .::::have
`` The rains have brought the grass up , and as likely as not they may <<target>> when they get to some good pastures and wait till the others join them .::::halt
It is not likely that all that <<target>> came from one place . ''::::gang
`` I expect that they have been gathered up from lonely farmhouses where they have escaped the commandos , and they will want to divide their <<target>> between them ; they do n't trust each other a bit , and each would cheat his fellows of his share if he could .::::plunder
So I should think that what you suggest is likely enough , and that it has <<target>> arranged to wait when they come to a good place till the others arrive .::::been
But you are not thinking of <<target>> them , are you ? ''::::rescuing
`` If we thrash the Boers at the <<target>> I shall certainly have a try .::::farm
We did carry off two or three thousand head about two months ago from the hands of at least <<target>> large a party as this , and I do n't see why we should not do it again .::::as
It was near <<target>> Umhlumba . ''::::mount
`` Was it your party <<target>> did that ? ''::::that
`` Why , it was the talk of the whole district , <<target>> some of the cattle belonged to a friend of mine .::::and
He told me how he <<target>> been saved from ruin .::::had
Well , sir , after that I shall feel more <<target>> than I acknowledge I have been up to now .::::confident
Captain Brookfield told me about your going into the Boer camp in disguise , and to Komati-poort , and <<target>> you surprised a party of Boers looting a farm near Dundee ; but he did not mention that .::::how
In fact , he had only just finished telling me the other <<target>> when you came in saying that you were ready to start .::::affairs
Well , well , it is wonderful that a party of <<target>> gentlemen like yours should have done such things ! ''::::young
They did not hurry their horses , but for the most part went at the steady <<target>> to which the animals were most accustomed ; occasionally they would walk for a bit .::::canter
At Weenan , where they crossed the Bushman river , they halted for half an hour , and for double that time after crossing the Mooi at Intembeni ; then <<target>> the sun began to lose its power they went fast , until , when they reached one of the farthest spurs of Botha 's Castle , the farmer said :::::as
`` When we get over the next <<target>> we shall see the house . ''::::rise
Chris gave the order to dismount , and , going forward on foot , they threw themselves <<target>> when close to the crest , and crawled forward until they obtained a fair view .::::down
Sankey and Chris were again provided with glasses , having bought them on the day before starting at the sale of the effects <<target>> several officers who had fallen in a fight at Vaal Krantz , and all gazed intently for some time at the house .::::of
`` Thank God they are <<target>> right so far ! ''::::all
Chris said to <<target>> farmer .::::the
`` I can see the Boers lying all round the house , and that <<target>> clump is their horses ; so our ride has not been in vain .::::dark

Which side is <<target>> ? ''::::it
`` That corner of <<target>> house hides it .::::the
It is on the <<target>> side . ''::::eastern

If I had known that we should have got here before <<target>> , we need not have troubled to bring the Zulus .::::dark
I intended to send them forward to see how matters stood , <<target>> they could have guided us right up to the gate .::::then
However , as they have all got guns , and can shoot , it will add to the panic our attack <<target>> create , and they will all be pleased at the chance of at last getting a shot at the Boers .::::will
They were complaining to me the other day that they were very happy in all other <<target>> , but they were very much disappointed at not having had a fight . ''::::respects
The natives were indeed delighted when , on Chris rejoining them , he told <<target>> that they should take their share in the attack on the Boers .::::them
Chris and his friends all threw themselves on the ground , <<target>> sending up Jack to the crest to keep watch .::::after
But the farmer said , `` I dare not lie down ; <<target>> I did , I should never get up again . ''::::if
He had , indeed , to be <<target>> off his horse when they dismounted .::::lifted
`` I can quite understand <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::that
`` I feel stiff and tired myself , and you must be almost made <<target>> iron to have ridden one hundred and forty miles almost without halting . ''::::of
`` If anyone had told me that I could <<target>> it , I should not have believed him .::::do
Of course one is on horseback <<target>> good many hours a day .::::a
Often , after going round the farm , I start at two or three o'clock and ride <<target>> Greytown and back ; but that is only a matter of some fifteen miles each way .::::into
Still , when one has got seven men 's lives <<target>> upon one , one makes a big effort . ''::::depending
`` I tell you <<target>> , Mr. Searle .::::what
The best thing you can do <<target>> to strip and lie down .::::is
I will set the two <<target>> to knead you .::::zulus
You will find yourself quite a <<target>> man after it . ''::::new
For half an hour the two men rubbed and kneaded the farmer 's muscles <<target>> head to foot , exerting themselves until the perspiration streamed from them .::::from
Then one of them brought up one of <<target>> water-skins and poured the contents over him .::::the
`` I do n't say the stiffness has all gone , but I certainly <<target>> n't feel any worse than I did when I got to your camp .::::do
I should never have thought <<target>> it myself . ''::::of
`` It is what is done after <<target>> Turkish bath , '' Chris said .::::a
`` I have had <<target>> often at Johannesburg .::::them
The natives do something <<target>> the same sort .::::of
They make a little hut of boughs , and fill a hole in the middle with hot stones <<target>> pour water over them , and steam themselves , and I believe get rubbed too . ''::::and
As soon as they considered it dark enough to be perfectly safe , they led their horses down <<target>> they judged that they were within half a mile of the house , then dismounted and waited .::::until
Chris had already <<target>> all arrangements .::::made
The firing at the house would act as a guide to the spot where they <<target>> placed , and he was , if possible , to attack them from behind .::::were
He was to shoot down the guards , but not to pursue <<target>> if the horses bolted on hearing the attack on the house .::::them
`` What you have to do is <<target>> stampede them , '' Chris said .::::to
`` As soon as you have got them on the run , keep <<target>> going , and if they scatter , do you scatter too .::::them

It was just ten o'clock when there was a violent outburst of <<target>> at the farmhouse , and all sprung into their saddles .::::fire
`` Now , Carmichael , <<target>> you gallop on .::::do
Get as close as you can <<target>> the horses without being observed .::::to
Go at a walk the last hundred yards or so ; the horse guards are not likely to <<target>> you , they are sure to be up on the edge of the dip watching the farm .::::hear
Stay quiet till you hear our yell , <<target>> then go straight in to them .::::and
In that case you may manage without their getting a shot at you , <<target>> as likely as not they will have strolled up without their rifles . ''::::for
As soon as Carmichael 's little party had started , <<target>> moved on with the rest at a walk .::::chris
`` There is no occasion to <<target>> , '' he said .::::hurry

It was , however , at a fast <<target>> that they rode up towards the wall .::::pace
Chris blew his whistle , and the cheer of the whites and the <<target>> of the two Zulus burst out at the top of their voices .::::warcry
`` Give it to them <<target>> , lads ! ''::::hot
Chris shouted , for the <<target>> of the Boers .::::benefit

As Chris 's whistle sounded these galloped forward , and at <<target>> volley three of the Boers fell , the other fled .::::their
At once with loud shouts they charged in among the ponies , <<target>> were already kicking and plunging at the sudden sound of firearms .::::who
The firing had been unnoticed by the Boers round the house , and these , when on arriving at the hollow they found their <<target>> gone , gave vent to their alarm and rage in many strange oaths , and then scattered in flight all over the country .::::horses
`` It is of no use trying to pursue , '' Chris said , as soon as it was <<target>> that all the Boers , save those lying dying or dead , had escaped from the yard .::::found
`` We should only ruin the horses , and they <<target>> done a big day 's work already . ''::::have
The besieged could be heard hastily removing the barricades against the door , and in two or three minutes ran out , almost <<target>> at the suddenness of their relief , when they thought that nothing remained to be done but to sell their lives dearly .::::bewildered
A few hurried words explained the position to them , <<target>> their gratitude to Chris and his party was unbounded .::::and
Their first step was to <<target>> to the fallen Boers .::::attend
Of these there were eighteen wounded and eleven killed , and as soon as all in their power had been done for the former , <<target>> they had been carried into the house , a blazing fire was lit in one of the rooms and the party all gathered there .::::and
`` Now , Mr. King , '' Searle said , `` you are the <<target>> of this party ; what do you think had best be done ? ''::::baas
`` I think the first thing , '' Chris said , `` is to post <<target>> a dozen men , three or four hundred yards away , round the house .::::half

When I whistle , do you come in to me , leaving the others <<target>> guard , then I will tell you what we have decided upon . ''::::on
Jack had already filled the kettles the colonists had brought <<target>> them , and placed them over the fire .::::with
`` While the tea is getting ready , '' Chris said , `` <<target>> had better give a good feed of mealies to all the horses .::::we
How many of yours <<target>> there left ? ''::::are
he asked one <<target>> the colonists .::::of
`` All the twelve we had at first were unwounded this evening , <<target>> I ca n't say whether any of them have been hit since .::::but
The wall was too high for bullets to touch them as long as the Boers were outside , <<target>> most likely as we were firing through the window we may have hit some of them . ''::::but
`` I do n't suppose you did so , because I fancy that directly <<target>> Boers began fighting here the horses bunched in one corner of the yard .::::the
That is a matter of importance , for our horses <<target>> scarcely be fit for work in the morning .::::will

`` Yes , I want them in , but I specially want them <<target>> collect and drive in a score of the Boer ponies . ''::::to
`` At daybreak we will all go , '' another of <<target>> farmers said , `` and lend a hand . ''::::the

`` It would make our success pretty well a certainty if we <<target>> get the ponies by that time , '' Chris said .::::could
In less than half an <<target>> the seven farmers started .::::hour
Only one of the horses had been killed , and they rode away at a rate that <<target>> that the others were none the worse for their three days on somewhat short rations .::::showed
I wish Peters and his party could do the same , but it <<target>> not do to trust to the Boers not coming back again . ''::::would
All were asleep in a few minutes , but an hour <<target>> they heard a shot fired , followed by several others .::::later
They leapt to their feet , seized their <<target>> , and ran out into the yard .::::rifles
There was , however , no repetition of the firing , and a few minutes later Peters came <<target>> and reported that the Zulus had discovered a number of Boers making their way cautiously forward .::::in
`` I do n't suppose we <<target>> hear any more of them .::::shall
They hoped they might <<target>> us asleep .::::catch
Now they find that <<target>> are on watch .::::we
I expect they will give up <<target>> idea and make off .::::the
It is a nuisance having been disturbed , but I am not sorry for it , for the Boers will have lost a <<target>> of hours , and even if the horses do not come in we shall still have a chance of overtaking them .::::couple
Now , Peters , you had better get forty winks ; I will go out <<target>> Brown , Field , and Sankey , and relieve the three out there .::::with

You need not send out when the farmers <<target>> back ; we shall see them . ''::::come
Chris had been nearly two hours on watch when he made out in the <<target>> moonlight a number of horses and mounted figures going towards the house .::::bright
He at once woke the sleepers and called the others in , and by the time they reached <<target>> farm some thirty unmounted ponies , followed by Carmichael 's party and the farmers , came up .::::the
`` We have been longer than we expected , '' one of the latter said as he <<target>> , `` but we were lucky at last in finding this lot together in a kloof .::::dismounted
Have you seen anything <<target>> the Boers ?::::of
We thought we heard <<target>> few shots . ''::::a
`` Yes , they came here and tried to turn the tables on <<target>> ; but we had the Zulus and some of the scouts out .::::us

Now , Carmichael , go in with your <<target>> and get a cup of tea . ''::::party
are we going to <<target>> again ? ''::::start
Carmichael asked rather dismally ; `` we were only just getting off to <<target>> when Willesden , who was on watch , heard three shots . ''::::sleep
`` Some of us have only had <<target>> hour 's sleep , Carmichael .::::an
But there is another day 's work before us , and after <<target>> you may sleep for twenty- four hours if you like . ''::::that
I suppose I can do it if the others can ; still , after seventy-five miles here , five miles out , and something like <<target>> miles chasing the horses , and five miles back again , I think we have done a pretty good day 's work . ''::::five
`` No doubt you have , '' Chris said , `` a thundering good day 's work ; but a fellow is not <<target>> calling a fellow if he ca n't manage to do two days ' work at a stretch for once in a way .::::worth
At any rate , the horses will be fresh , which is of much more <<target>> than our being so ; they have had three days ' perfect rest .::::importance

None of the farmers was willing to stay , and <<target>> last they had to decide the question by lot .::::at
`` Now , '' Chris said , `` you gentlemen know the country a great deal better than <<target>> do , and can tell us which way they are most likely to take their cattle . ''::::we
`` They are sure to go north , there <<target>> no other way for them to go .::::is
If the whole party were together and mounted , they might go up through <<target>> ; as it is , they would not venture to do that .::::zululand

`` I expect the cattle will be somewhere near Inadi ; there is some good grazing along there , <<target>> as all the loyalists have cleared off long ago they will have no fear of being disturbed . ''::::and
The saddles were transferred from their own horses to the Boer ponies , and it <<target>> finally arranged that the waggon with the wounded should not start until their return .::::was
Jack and the two Zulus were left with them , and even should another party of <<target>> come along the six men would be able to defend themselves till the others returned .::::boers
Half an hour after the arrival of Carmichael 's party they started in pursuit , and directed their course for Inadi , as it would have been useless <<target>> search for the Boers , and it was certain that these would make for the point where it had been arranged that the cattle should cross .::::to
It was some fifteen miles away , and they were confident that they would arrive there before the Boers , who , bad walkers at the best of times , and <<target>> by their failure , at the loss of many of their companions and of all their horses , would not have got more than half-way by the time they started .::::disheartened
It was half-past two when they left , <<target>> when they approached Inadi day was breaking .::::and
They had put on their Boer hats , and knew that the men in charge of the <<target>> would take them to be some of their own party until they were quite close .::::herd
To their satisfaction they saw the herd grazing half a mile south of the village , and it was not until they were within <<target>> hundred yards of the spot where the smoke of a fire showed that the guard were posted , that they saw any movement .::::a
Then a man rose to his feet , and , <<target>> at them earnestly , gave a shout of alarm .::::looking
`` Surrender , '' he shouted in <<target>> , `` or we fire !::::dutch
Down with your <<target>> ! ''::::rifles
Seeing that resistance was useless the Boers threw down their weapons , and in <<target>> minute were tied hand and foot with the ropes from their saddles .::::a
They were then lashed to bushes at some little distance from each other , <<target>> as to prevent their rolling together and loosening each other 's cords .::::so
The natives with them had at the first alarm fled <<target>> full speed , and were already out of sight .::::at
Then the whole party rode to a ridge a quarter of a mile <<target>> , dismounted at its foot , and crawled up to the crest .::::back
A mile away some fifty men could be seen <<target>> making their way on foot towards them .::::wearily
`` We have done quite enough in the way of fighting , '' Chris said , `` and I <<target>> think that they have had more than enough ; we will get them to surrender if we can .::::should
We will wait till they are within forty or fifty yards and then fire <<target>> few shots over their heads , and see what comes of it .::::a
We have good cover here , <<target>> they are in the open .::::and
They will know very well that there is not a chance of their getting away , for , as we have horses and they have <<target>> , we could defend any eminence we chose to occupy , and ride off to another if they were likely to take it .::::none
Besides , they would never be able to <<target>> the river under our fire . ''::::cross
When the Boers were within eighty yards <<target>> a dozen rifles were discharged .::::half
They at once threw <<target>> on the ground .::::themselves
A pause ensued , and the Boers <<target>> be heard talking excitedly together .::::could
When he thought that he had given them time enough <<target>> appreciate their condition , Chris shouted in Dutch :::::to
We do n't want to have to kill <<target>> all , which we could certainly do .::::you
You must see that you <<target>> at our mercy .::::are
If you choose to surrender you may go home ; if you do n't , we shall let you <<target>> there as long as you like , and shoot you down when you get on your feet .::::lie
I will give you five minutes <<target>> make up your minds . ''::::to
At the end of that time one of the Boers held <<target>> his rifle with a white flag tied to it .::::up
`` That is not good enough <<target>> us , '' Chris shouted .::::for
`` That trick has <<target>> tried too often .::::been
If you surrender , you will take off your bandoliers and belts and <<target>> them and your rifles behind you , and come forward unarmed . ''::::leave
There was a shout of fury among the Boers as <<target>> found that their treacherous design had failed in success .::::they
`` I will give you another five minutes , '' Chris shouted ; `` and if <<target>> do n't do as I tell you we shall open fire on you . ''::::you
Before that time was up the Boers were seen to be taking off their bandoliers , <<target>> one by one they rose and came forward in a body without their rifles .::::and
Chris allowed them to come half-way , so that they could not , when <<target>> found themselves in superior force , run back to their arms again .::::they
He gave the word , and <<target>> party rose to their feet .::::his
`` Now , '' he said , as the Boers came <<target>> , `` you will turn all your pockets inside out .::::up
I have not the least doubt that you are <<target>> taking off mementos of your visit here . ''::::all
Indeed , the pockets of the <<target>> were all bulging out .::::prisoners
Sullenly the Boers <<target>> the order .::::obeyed
The collection was <<target>> miscellaneous one .::::a
They had between them the <<target>> of a dozen farms .::::spoil
Besides this were spoons , forks , and cutlery , chimney ornaments , <<target>> 's clothes , several purses , and packets of spare cartridges .::::children
`` That will do very nicely , '' Chris said , when <<target>> had been ascertained that all the plunder had been disgorged .::::it
`` Now , gentlemen , you are at liberty to <<target>> , and I wish you a pleasant walk home .::::go

I have no doubt that you will be able to <<target>> food from your countrymen as you go along .::::obtain
You are sure to find friends at all the villages , <<target>> some of you may get ponies at Helpmakaar . ''::::and
Then they collected the cattle , and , <<target>> them before them , rode off .::::driving

In four hours they were roused , and <<target>> their course till they reached the farm .::::continued
Here they rested till the next morning , then at daybreak the wounded Boers were placed in a waggon ; the ammunition was divided among the farmers ; and the rifles taken from the Boers , and those that belonged to the killed and wounded , amounting in all to eighty-one , were , after the charges had <<target>> carefully drawn , also placed in the waggon , Chris saying , `` They would be useless to us , and they may be useful to you , for they will arm all the people in Greytown ; and with eighty magazine rifles you ought to be able to beat off any parties you may meet .::::been

Chris , however , was much more communicative to Captain Brookfield , who said as he <<target>> his tent , `` Well , Chris , did you get there in time ? ''::::entered
`` Yes , sir ; we caught them as they <<target>> attacking the house at ten o'clock that night .::::were

`` Yes , sir , if <<target>> will take us . ''::::you

There was little <<target>> that evening .::::talking
As soon as the tents had been erected , a cup of cocoa and a biscuit taken , all turned in , <<target>> even the constant booming of the artillery and the occasional sharp crack of musketry had no effect whatever on their slumbers .::::and
Just before Chris lay down , however , an orderly <<target>> him that Captain Brookfield wished to see him .::::told
`` I have just received orders , Chris , that our brigade <<target>> cavalry is to turn out tomorrow morning to support the infantry .::::of

We should all be terribly disappointed if we could not go out the <<target>> day that there has been a chance of our doing something . ''::::first
`` It is always as well to be on the right side , but I hardly think so many troops will really be required ; <<target>> I think it is a symptom that a serious attack will be made in a day or two on Monte Cristo and Hlangwane .::::and
You see , the possession of Cingola and Monte Cristo will take us pretty well round its flank , <<target>> I do not expect the Boers will be so much prepared there as they are in front . ''::::and
An hour before daylight all were out engaged in grooming their horses , which , having received a hot mash of mealie flour directly they <<target>> in on the previous evening , looked better than could have been expected after their hard work on two days out of three .::::came
By the time they had finished , the natives had breakfast ready , <<target>> they had scarcely eaten this when a trumpet sounded to horse .::::and
Five minutes later the mounted infantry belonging to the regular regiments and the Colonial Horse formed up , and , <<target>> by Lord Dundonald , marched north-east , followed by the three infantry brigades and some batteries of artillery .::::led
When within a couple of miles of the nek , the mounted infantry galloped forward , and selecting <<target>> spot where the ascent was gradual , pushed rapidly up the hill until they reached its brow .::::a
Here the horses were placed in a depression , <<target>> the men scattered themselves across the crest .::::and
They were but just in time , for a considerable force of Boers from Monte Cristo were hurrying along to assist the defenders of <<target>> , it having now become evident to them that this was the point to which the infantry moving across the plain were making .::::cingola
A brisk fire was opened as they approached , and the Boers at once stopped in surprise , for as they came along they had been unable <<target>> see that the cavalry had quitted the rest of the column , and had therefore no idea whatever that their way to Cingola was barred .::::to
As the rapid fire showed them that the nek was held in force , they did not think <<target>> prudent to advance farther , but after an exchange of fire fell back to Monte Cristo .::::it
The task of the infantry <<target>> now comparatively easy .::::was
Cingola was not held in any great force ; and seeing that their retreat along the nek was cut off , and that they could not hope to resist the strong force that was approaching , <<target>> enemy contented themselves with keeping up a brisk fire for a time , and then retreated hastily down the northern face of the hill , and scattered among numerous kopjes between it and the river .::::the
Lyttleton and Hildyard 's brigades occupied the peak , and Barton , <<target>> the Fusilier battalions , remained to the left of its base .::::with
As the mounted infantry had , before opening fire , taken shelter behind bushes and rocks , there were <<target>> two or three casualties , and they were much disappointed that the affair had been so trifling .::::only
The mounted infantry remained all night in their position , acting as an advanced guard to the infantry ; but they had orders to descend the hill <<target>> daybreak and return to Chieveley , there being no water obtainable for their horses , and their services not being required for the succeeding operations .::::before
The next morning ( Sunday ) a battery of field- artillery , which had been taken half-way up Cingola , began to shell Monte Cristo , and as if this had been the <<target>> , the whole of the artillery on the plain opened a terrific fire on the entrenchments of Monte Cristo , Hlangwane , and Green Hill , which was close to Monte Cristo .::::signal
On the morning of the 18th , Lyttleton and Hildyard 's brigades moved forward to storm the precipitous <<target>> , and Barton 's brigade marched against the tangled and difficult ground that surrounded Green Hill .::::peak
The Queen 's on the right and the Scotch Fusiliers <<target>> the left led the attack against the peak .::::on
The hillside was partly wooded , but although the smokeless powder gave little indication as to the progress the <<target>> were making , occasional glimpses of the Boers flitting among the trees showed that these were falling back .::::troops
For a short time there was a pause , and then Lyttleton 's men , having gathered at the edge of <<target>> wood some couple of hundred yards from the summit , advanced with a rush up the terribly steep rocks .::::a
The Boers fired hurriedly , but the bullets flew for the most part far over the heads of the Queen 's , <<target>> then , fearful of being caught by Hildyard 's men , who were also rapidly coming up , they fled hastily .::::and
The opposition had <<target>> been trifling .::::finally
The vast majority of the Boers had cleared off , and the rest , after emptying their magazines , had followed their example before the troops <<target>> the summit , upon which a heavy cannonade was at once opened from Grobler 's Hill , Fort Wylie , and other Boer positions .::::gained
This , however , gradually slackened under the storm of lyddite shells with which they were pelted by the naval guns , and the <<target>> position of Hlangwane was at last secured , and no time was lost in getting up guns and preparing for a farther advance .::::important
Barton 's brigade had been equally successful in their attack , and half an hour after <<target>> capture of Monte Cristo the Fusiliers crowned the summit of the wood-covered Green Hill .::::the
The Boers ' defences were now examined , and <<target>> to be of a most formidable nature .::::proved
On the south face of the hill the <<target>> were in tiers , line behind line .::::trenches
Most of them were fully six feet deep , and in many cases provided with shelter from <<target>> weather by sheets of corrugated iron , taken from the roofs of the houses in Colenso .::::the
These had evidently been used <<target>> sleeping and living places .::::for
The ground was strewn with straw , empty tins , fragments of food , bones , cartridge- <<target>> , old bandoliers , and large quantities of unopened tinned food and sacks of mealie flour .::::cases
Here and there were patches of dried blood , showing where the wounded by our shell had been <<target>> in , and laid down until they could be removed to the hospital under cover of night .::::brought
On the plateau the <<target>> was similar .::::scene
Here every irregularity of ground had been utilized , and long lines of trenches intersected it , showing that <<target>> Boers had intended to make a desperate resistance even after we had won our way up the hill .::::the
These were in a similar <<target>> of litter and disorder .::::state
Although they had saved their guns , they had left behind them large quantities of ammunition and provisions in the hurried flight , necessitated by our attack being <<target>> in a direction from which no danger had been apprehended , Four waggons full of ammunition had been left by them in a kloof near the river .::::delivered
These had been observed by the Engineers in the balloon , and their position had been signalled to the <<target>> brigade , who , turning their guns upon them , before long succeeded in blowing them up .::::naval
While for weeks they had been working incessantly to render the hill impregnable , they had prepared <<target>> only on the face against which they made sure the British infantry would dash itself .::::it
Nevertheless , in this , as in every action , the Boers , as soon as they saw <<target>> there was a risk of the position being taken , began early to make preparations for retreat .::::that
While keeping up a very heavy musketry fire on the woods through which <<target>> British infantry were advancing , they began to withdraw their guns .::::the
The speed and skill with which on every occasion throughout the war they shifted heavy pieces of artillery <<target>> one point to another , or withdrew them altogether , was a new feature in warfare .::::from
Except when the garrison of Ladysmith , on two occasions of night sorties , surprised and destroyed three of their guns , they <<target>> lost a piece either in the numerous actions during our advance to Ladysmith , or in their final retreat from that town .::::scarcely
And similarly on the other side , of the very large number of guns employed at the fight on the Modder , at Magersfontein , and in the siege of Kimberley the whole were , with the exception of a few pieces <<target>> when Cronje was surrounded , withdrawn in spite of the hurried evacuation of their position , a feat almost unparalleled even in an army accompanied only by field-artillery , and extraordinary indeed in the case of works mounting heavy siege-guns .::::captured
No farther advance was made till the afternoon , when General Buller arrived on the summit of Green Hill , and seeing that <<target>> was not entrenched on its northern side , which was completely turned by our advance , sent Barton 's brigade against it .::::hlangwane
But the loss of Monte Cristo had for the time quite taken the fight out of the Boers , and after maintaining a brisk fire for a <<target>> period , they evacuated the position as soon as the infantry neared the summit , and , hurrying down the western slope , crossed the Tugela .::::short
Three camps full of provisions , blankets , and the necessaries of Boer life fell into <<target>> hands of the captors , together with a large amount of rifle and Maxim ammunition .::::the
The place had been <<target>> into a fortress .::::turned
Trenches and some breastworks covered all the approaches by which the Boers might look for an attack , and as the whole mountain <<target>> covered with huge boulders , they were able to withstand even the storm of lyddite shell that was poured upon them .::::was
On the following day Hart 's brigade <<target>> orders to advance towards Colenso .::::received
This was still held in force by the Boers , but was now commanded by guns that had been got up the slopes of Hlangwane , and on Tuesday morning General <<target>> captured the position without serious loss , the Boers suffering severely from our shrapnel fire as they retreated , some by the iron bridge and others by a ford .::::hart
Thorneycroft 's Mounted Infantry , which was called up in the evening , took advantage of the discovery that a drift existed <<target>> , and a squadron forded the river in spite of a scattered fire from the Boers on the opposite bank .::::there
The next morning Thorneycroft 's regiment crossed , and , moving to the left , seized the kopjes facing Grobler 's Kloof ; the Boers , still suffering from <<target>> effect of their unexpected reverses , offered no resistance , but , abandoning all their camps , trenches , and redoubts , retired at once to the hill .::::the
The Scouts had followed Thorneycroft 's Horse in support , and now , placing their horses under <<target>> in the abandoned entrenchments , prepared to act as infantry should the Boers take the offensive .::::shelter
This , however , they showed no intention of doing , and in the <<target>> the troops who had crossed were able to examine the deserted camps .::::afternoon
They presented very much the same appearance <<target>> those on Monte Cristo and Hlangwane .::::as
Many of them appeared to have been occupied by men of a better position , as many articles of luxury , choicer food , wearing <<target>> , newspapers , Bibles , fruit , and other signs of comfort littered the places ; but even here dirt had reigned supreme .::::apparel
Although they must have been inhabited for a long time , it could be seen that no attempts <<target>> been made to clear away the refuse , or to make them in any degree tidy .::::had
As was natural , the effect of the heat of the sun on scraps of food , vegetables , and refuse <<target>> all kinds caused a sickening stench , and the soldiers spent as short a time as possible over their investigations .::::of
One article which would have been found in a British camp was altogether absent from those of the enemy , and it was a joke among our <<target>> that the only piece of soap ever captured was found in the pocket of a dead Boer , and that its wrapper was still unopened .::::troops
Colenso itself had been in a similar manner rendered almost impregnable to a frontal attack , <<target>> could hardly have been captured by an assaulting force until Hlangwane had been taken .::::and
The Dorsets , Middlesex , and Somersets crossed at once , and , ascending the kopjes , extended their line south until they were in <<target>> with Thorneycroft 's men , holding therefore the railway line along the river bank nearly half the distance between Colenso and Pieters station .::::communication
Other regiments and <<target>> followed .::::artillery
It was now six days since the advance had commenced , <<target>> for the past four fighting had been almost continuous .::::and
On Wednesday the three regiments advanced towards Grobler 's Hill <<target>> order to ascertain what force was occupying it .::::in
They met with no opposition until they reached the lower <<target>> , nor could any Boers be seen moving .::::slopes
Then suddenly a heavy fire broke out from the boulders which covered the whole face of the <<target>> , and afforded such perfect shelter that it had not been considered necessary to form entrenchments .::::hill
As only a reconnaissance , and not an attack , had been ordered , the force <<target>> , the Somersets , who were the leading regiment , having nearly a hundred casualties .::::retired
The other regiments had as <<target>> more between them .::::many
The next day a continuous fire from all the points held <<target>> the Boers showed that large reinforcements had reached them .::::by
The Lancashire Brigade , under Colonel Wynne , started at two o'clock that afternoon to carry <<target>> kopjes up the Brook Spruit , which ran in the rear of Grobler 's Kloof .::::the
The Royal Lancasters led the way , but as soon as they left the shelter of the ridges by the <<target>> of the railway they were exposed to a terrible fire , both in front and from Grobler 's Kloof .::::side
The Lancasters advanced with the greatest coolness up <<target>> spruit , followed by the South Lancasters .::::the
As they pressed forward they were met by a heavy rifle <<target>> both from the kopjes in front and on the left .::::fire
The Boers stuck to the hill until the Lancasters were within <<target>> hundred yards , then most of them slunk off .::::a
For the past two days the Dublin <<target>> had been lying near Colenso .::::fusiliers
They had suffered very heavily in the first attack at Potgieter 's Drift , but they now volunteered to take Grobler 's Hill ; and this , aided with the fire of the artillery <<target>> Colonel Wynne 's brigade , they did in gallant style , the Boers being evidently nervous that they might find their retreat cut off should the Lancasters advance farther up the spruit .::::and
The sides were broken with <<target>> ledges covered with boulders .::::sharp
The railway passed through this , separating the last jagged ledge from <<target>> higher portion of the hill , which rises almost precipitously .::::the
Running back several hundred yards at the base of <<target>> line was a dip full of thorn trees .::::this
A little farther to the rear was another steep hill , <<target>> which the enemy 's Creusot guns were now mounted .::::on
Several trenches were cut alongside the hillsides , <<target>> on the crest were some strong redoubts .::::and
It was a most formidable position , but as it seemed to bar all progress <<target>> up the line , it was necessary to carry it at all costs .::::farther
On Thursday , Captain Brookfield had obtained a pass for himself and three other officers to go to Hlangwane to <<target>> the operations , but one of these being unwell , Captain Brook-field invited Chris to take his place .::::view
After inspecting the plateau , they made <<target>> way down to the left .::::their
Hearing that an attack was about to be made on Railway Hill , they clambered down until they reached a point <<target>> , seated in an open spot among the trees , they could command a view of what was passing .::::where
`` It is an awful place , '' Chris said , `` <<target>> it seems to me almost impossible to be carried . ''::::and
`` This is one of the times , Chris , when one feels the advantage of belonging to a mounted corps , for without being <<target>> brave than other men , I should regard it as an order to meet certain death were I told to attack that rugged hill .::::less
Ah , there are <<target>> Irish Brigade ! ''::::the
The storming party consisted of the Inniskillings , with companies of the <<target>> , the Connaught Bangers , and the Imperial Light Infantry .::::dublins
From a building called Platelayer 's House at the mouth of the spruit , to the foot of the hill , the ground was perfectly open to the point <<target>> the left face of Railway Hill rose steeply up , and across this open ground , a distance of half a mile , the assailants had to march .::::where
`` Here they <<target>> ! ''::::come
As , in open order , with their rifles at the trail , the Inniskillings appeared in view , <<target>> terrible fire broke out from every ledge of Railway Hill , while the cannon joined in the roar .::::a
The guns on Hlangwane , and those on the slopes nearer the <<target>> , with Maxims and quick-firing guns , replied on our side .::::river
`` It is awful , '' Chris said , speaking to <<target>> rather than to the captain who was standing beside him .::::himself
`` I do n't think that even at Badajos , <<target>> soldiers were ever sent on a more desperate enterprise .::::british
It looks as if nothing could live under that fire even <<target>> ; what will it be when they get closer ? ''::::now
Not a shot was fired by the advancing infantry in <<target>> to the storm of bullets from the Boer marksmen .::::reply
Every round of ammunition might be wanted yet , and <<target>> would only be wasted on an invisible foe .::::it
They took advantage of what little shelter could be obtained , sometimes close to the <<target>> bank , sometimes following some slight depression which afforded at least a partial protection .::::river
At last they reached a deep donga running into the river ; this was crossed by a small <<target>> , and in passing over it they had to run the gauntlet of the Boer fire .::::bridge
Many fell here , but the stream of men passed on , and then at a double rushed to <<target>> sheltered spot close to the foot of the ascent , where they had been ordered to gather .::::a
Here they had <<target>> breathing space .::::a
Their real work was yet to begin , <<target>> already their casualties had been numerous .::::but
Occasionally a short gasp broke from one or other as a shell burst in the thick of <<target>> men crossing the little bridge , a cry as if they themselves had been struck .::::the
When the troops gained their shelter <<target>> was a sigh of relief .::::there
`` It would need ten times as many <<target>> to give them a chance . ''::::men
This was the opinion of them all , and they hoped even now that this was but the <<target>> party , and that ere long they would see a far larger body of men coming up .::::advance
But there were no signs of reinforcements , and at <<target>> o'clock the troops were re-formed and the advance began .::::five
They dashed forward up the hill under a heavy <<target>> , to which the supporting line replied .::::fire
The boulders afforded a certain amount of shelter , and of this the Inniskillings <<target>> every advantage , until they reached the last ledge with comparatively little loss .::::took
But the work was <<target>> before them .::::still
Leaping over , they rushed down <<target>> to the railway line .::::on
Here a wire-fence arrested their course for a moment , <<target>> many fell while getting through or over it .::::and
Hitherto the fire of the Boers had been far less destructive than might have been expected , their <<target>> being confused and their aim flurried by the constant explosion of lyddite shell from the British batteries .::::attention
They had but one eye for their assailants , the other for the guns , and as each of the heavy pieces was <<target>> , they ducked down for shelter , only to get up again to take a hasty shot before having to hide again .::::fired
Thus , then , they were in no condition to reckon the comparatively small numbers of their assailants , and as they saw the <<target>> dashing forward , cheering loudly , with pointed bayonets , they hesitated , and then bolted up the hill to the next trench .::::irishmen
Instead of waiting until the supports had come up for another rush , <<target>> Irishmen with a cheer dashed across the trench in hot pursuit .::::the
No fewer than two hundred of the Inniskillings had fallen in that desperate charge , their colonel <<target>> ten officers being either killed or wounded , while the Dublins also lost their colonel .::::and
All through the night the trench was held sternly , in spite <<target>> repeated and desperate efforts of the Boers to dislodge its defenders .::::of
Nothing could be done for those who <<target>> wounded on the hill above .::::lay
Morning broke , and <<target>> fight still continued .::::the
At nine o'clock another desperate charge was made ; but the Boers were unable to face the steady fire <<target>> was maintained by the defenders of the trench , and they again turned and ran for their shelters .::::that
Just as this attack was repulsed , Lyttleton 's brigade arrived on the scene , exchanging a <<target>> cheer with the men who had so long borne the brunt of this terrible conflict .::::hearty
The Durham Light Infantry at once relieved those in the trenches , and <<target>> descended the hill for the rest that was so much needed .::::these
All that day the fighting continued , and while Lyttleton 's men held to the position on Railway Hill , <<target>> was fierce fighting away to the left , where the Welsh Fusiliers and other regiments were hotly engaged .::::there

The truce began at four o'clock in the morning of Sunday the 25th , and the foes of <<target>> previous day mingled with each other in the sad work , conversing freely with each other .::::the
The Boers expressed their astonishment that such an attempt should ever have been made , and their stupefaction at the manner in which <<target>> Irish had pressed on through a fire in which it had seemed that no human being could have existed for a minute .::::the
When informed of the relief of Kimberley , and the fact that Cronje was hopelessly surrounded , they scoffed at the news as <<target>> fable , and were so honestly amused that it was evident they had been kept absolutely in the dark by their leaders .::::a
Captain Brookfield and his party had remained <<target>> the lookout until darkness set in .::::at
After the first exclamation of pain and grief as they saw the attack fail , <<target>> the fearfully thinned ranks run back to shelter , there had been little said .::::and

On Monday there was a continuation <<target>> the lull of firing .::::of
Many of the officers in camp who were off duty rode up to examine the scene of <<target>> fight , and they were not surprised when they saw the infantry recrossing the pontoon bridge .::::the
All wore a dejected aspect , but especially the men who had <<target>> so heroically and , as it now seemed , in vain .::::fought
All Chris 's party had come out , and those who had not before seen the view waited there for a couple of hours , ate some refreshment they had <<target>> with them , discussed the difficulties that lay in the way of farther advance , and the probable point against which General Buller would next direct his attack .::::brought
Chris exclaimed suddenly , `` that pontoon <<target>> is not coming back to camp .::::train

Such a spot was found by Colonel Sandbach of the Royal Engineers , and a <<target>> working party was at once set to work to make a practicable approach .::::strong
The point lay some three or four miles below Railway Hill , <<target>> the most formidable of the obstacles would therefore be turned .::::and
That night the troops crossed , and the Boers -- who were in ignorance of what had been going on , the point chosen for the passage being <<target>> the bend of the river and hidden by an intervening eminence from their positions -- were astonished at finding a strong force again across the river .::::at
As soon as the news reached the camp that the army was again crossing , satisfaction took the place <<target>> the deep depression that had reigned during the past two days , and the situation was eagerly discussed .::::of
Those who at all knew the country were eagerly questioned as <<target>> the ground farther on near the line of railway .::::to
All these agreed that the hill called Pieter 's was a formidable position , almost , though not perhaps quite , as strong as Railway Hill , but <<target>> beyond it the line ran through a comparatively open country , and that if this hill could be captured the relief of Ladysmith would be ensured .::::that

They thought that we were crawling up to make a night <<target>> , and so blazed away for all they were worth .::::attack
We found out afterwards that Philips had conceived the idea that <<target>> was possible to destroy that search-light of the Boers .::::it
He had learned from prisoners that it was the last they had with them , and although we have not made any night attacks yet , <<target>> was possible we might do so in the future , and so he made up his mind to have a try to smash it up .::::it
He took with him eight blue-jackets , crawled along in the <<target>> beyond our lines , and got in among the Boers .::::dark
He had taken particular notice of points he should have to pass , boulders <<target>> so on , and he found his way there without making a blunder .::::and
There were plenty of Boers round , <<target>> no one just at the search-light .::::but
Just as they had done so they heard four <<target>> who had been sitting talking together get up .::::boers
He and his party dropped among the bushes and lay <<target>> quiet while the Boers came up to the lamp .::::there
`` 'We are to keep it going to-night , ' one of them said , 'for they may take it into their heads to make <<target>> attack , thinking that after having had a truce all day we shall not be expecting trouble , and they may catch us unprepared .::::an
`` They moved away again , and Philips and his men stole quietly off , but before they rejoined <<target>> fellows they heard a sudden shot , and in a minute a tremendous rifle fire broke out .::::our
Evidently the German had arrived and found the search-light would not act , and they concluded at once that we were marching <<target>> them , and for twenty minutes every man in the trenches blazed away at random as fast as he could load .::::against
I should say that they must <<target>> wasted a hundred thousand cartridges .::::have
As there was no reply they began <<target>> think that they had been fooled .::::to
Our fellows were just as much puzzled at the row , and fell <<target>> , thinking that the Boers might possibly be going to attack them .::::in
However , matters quieted down , and it was not until the <<target>> morning that anyone knew what it had all been about . ''::::next
`` That was a plucky thing indeed , '' Chris said ; `` though , as I should hardly think we should attack at night , it may not be of much service , for the Boers have long <<target>> given up trying with their feeble flash- lights to interrupt our night signalling with Ladysmith , especially as , now the weather is finer , we can talk all day if we like with our heliograph . ''::::since
Chris was just turning in when Captain Brookfield <<target>> to the entrance of his tent .::::came
`` I have just heard , Chris , that the pontoon bridge has been successfully <<target>> across just below the cataract , and that the troops are all crossing .::::thrown
I just mention <<target>> to you .::::it
I can not get away myself , but if I find you and your boys <<target>> -- not here in the morning , I shall say nothing about it .::::are
We certainly shall <<target>> be wanted .::::not
The orders are out , and there is no mention <<target>> our corps nor any of the mounted colonials . ''::::of
I am very <<target>> obliged . ''::::much
Chris went round to the tents and told the others that they must be up an hour before <<target>> and be ready to start at once , as there would probably be another very big fight .::::daybreak
Then he told the natives , who were , as usual , still talking together in their tent , that they were all going off very <<target>> , and that chocolate must be ready at daybreak , and the water-skins filled , as the horses would probably be out all day .::::early
`` Will you want anything <<target>> , baas ? ''::::cooked
`` No ; we will <<target>> some tins with us .::::take
There is going to be another big fight to-morrow ; as we <<target>> all going , you can go too if you like .::::are
We shall want you <<target>> the horses .::::for
Three of you can stop with them at a time , and the others can go and see what <<target>> doing , and then change about , you know , so that you can all see something .::::is
The spare horses must have plenty of food left them , <<target>> must have a good drink before we start . ''::::and
They were all astir <<target>> good time .::::in
The natives had made some hot cakes , <<target>> these they ate with their chocolate .::::and
Knowing where the cataract was , they were able <<target>> calculate pretty accurately where they had best dismount .::::to
This they did in a <<target>> clump of trees .::::small
Then each took a tin of meat and a <<target>> of pounds of biscuit in his pocket .::::couple
`` Now , '' Chris said to the natives , `` you had better all stay here quietly <<target>> you hear firing begin ; then , Jack , you can go with the two Zulus .::::till
You can stay and look on <<target>> the middle of the day .::::till
When the sun is at its highest you must <<target>> back and let Japhet and the Swazis go .::::come
At sunset you must all be here <<target>> , and wait till we come .::::again
Perhaps we may be back sooner , and if so we shall ride away at once ; and those of you who are <<target>> when we start must go back to camp at once if you find that the horses have gone when you get here .::::away
Now let 's <<target>> off . ''::::be
They made their way up the hills , well pleased that <<target>> were enough trees and bushes to shield them from observation .::::there
The roar of artillery and the rattle of musketry had been going on for some <<target>> , but not with the fury that marked the commencement of an attack .::::time
A fortnight before it would have seemed to them that a great battle was in progress , but by this time they were accustomed <<target>> the almost incessant fire , and knew that although the cannonade was heavier than usual , no actual fighting was going on .::::to
They met no officers as they went along , nor did they expect to do so , for none of these would be able to leave <<target>> regiments , as even were these not included in the force told off to assault , they might be called upon later in the day .::::their
At last they reached the top of a hill whose face sloped steeply down to the river , and from <<target>> they could obtain a view of the Boer position , and of the line of railway up and down .::::here
To the right was Pieter 's station , with a <<target>> hill of the same name rising close to it .::::steep
To the left of this was another strongly-posted hill , while beyond it was the scene of the fighting on Friday and Saturday , <<target>> Hill , which had been rechristened Hart 's Hill , in honour of the commander of the brigade that had fought so valiantly .::::railway
It was evident that at these three points the whole <<target>> the fighting force of the Boers had gathered .::::of
A heavy rifle fire was being kept up against the British infantry , whose passage of the <<target>> had now been discovered , and who were lying crouched behind boulders and other shelter .::::river
On a kopje about a quarter of a mile behind and above them General Buller and his staff <<target>> taken up their position , and the lads kept themselves well within the trees to avoid observation .::::had
`` See , Chris , there are some of our <<target>> creeping along by the side of the river .::::fellows
They must be hidden from <<target>> sight of the Boers .::::the
I expect they will be <<target>> first to begin . ''::::the
All their glasses were turned <<target>> the column of men .::::upon
They were two battalions of the eth Brigade and the Dublin Fusiliers , and these , under General <<target>> 's command , made their way down the river bank for a mile and a half .::::barton
Then the lads saw that they were leaving <<target>> river and crossing the line of railway .::::the
`` They have evidently gone down there , '' Sankey said , `` because that <<target>> just this side must hide them from the Boers on Pieter 's Hill . ''::::spur
The column were lost sight of for upwards of an hour , and then they appeared on the opposite crest , <<target>> hundred feet above the line ; then they were lost sight of again as they passed beyond the crest .::::five
`` That is a <<target>> move ! ''::::splendid
`` By working round there they will gain the top of Pieter 's <<target>> , and come down like a thunderbolt upon the Boers . ''::::hill
The roar of <<target>> continued unabated .::::artillery
Clouds of yellowish-brown smoke floated over the Boer entrenchments , lit <<target>> occasionally by a vivid flash of a bursting lyddite shell .::::up
So terrible was the bombardment that the rifle fire of the Boers against the troops crouching behind their shelters was feeble <<target>> intermittent , as they dared not merge from their shelter-places to lift a head above their line of trenches .::::and
It was a long time before <<target>> 's troops were again seen .::::barton
Doubtless they had orders to wait for a time when they had gained their desired position , in order to allow the bombardment <<target>> do its work , and prepare the way for the assault of the other positions by the fourth and eleventh brigades .::::to
It was not , indeed , until the afternoon that the lads saw <<target>> 's brigade sweeping along to the attack of Pieter 's Hill .::::barton
The Boers saw them now , and could be seen leaping out of their entrenchments , regardless of the redoubled <<target>> of the artillery now concentrated upon them , and climbing up the hill to oppose this unexpected attack .::::fire
But before they could gather in sufficient numbers the British were <<target>> them , keeping up a terrible fire as they advanced .::::upon
Delighted to be able to do even a little towards the success of the <<target>> , the party at once picked up their rifles lying beside them .::::day
`` It is about a thousand yards , I <<target>> say , to the middle of the hill .::::should
Take steady aim and try and pick them <<target>> as they leave their trenches . ''::::off
The firing began at once slowly and steadily , and occasionally there <<target>> an exclamation of satisfaction when a bullet found its mark .::::was
Five minutes later a dismounted staff-officer came <<target>> to the trees behind them .::::down
`` What men <<target>> these ? ''::::are
he asked ; `` the <<target>> wishes to know . ''::::general
`` We are the Johannesburg <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::scouts
`` Are you in <<target>> , sir ? ''::::command
`` Then , will you please to accompany <<target>> at once to the general . ''::::me
On arriving at the spot where the general was standing a little <<target>> advance of his staff , the latter at once recognized Chris .::::in
`` Oh , it <<target>> you , Mr .::::is
`` I was afraid some of <<target>> men had left their stations .::::the
And what are you <<target>> here ? ''::::doing
`` We are trying to lend a hand to the troops over there , and as <<target>> are all good shots , I think we are being of some assistance . ''::::we
`` You had no right to <<target>> the camp , sir .::::leave
I suppose you call <<target>> independent service ? ''::::this
I hope that we are affording some help here , and we should not be doing any good in camp ; and as we have been nearly out <<target>> it through all this fighting , and there were no orders for the corps to do anything to-day , we thought we might be of use . ''::::of
`` You did wrong , sir , '' the general said , his <<target>> relaxing into a smile at the lad 's defence of himself .::::face
Chris said , saluting , and then <<target>> off to rejoin his comrades .::::hurried
`` I heard the other day -- though not officially , so I was not obliged to take notice of it -- that he , with the twenty lads with him , rode out to a place seventy miles away , and rescued some farmers who were <<target>> by Boers , defeated their assailants , killed and wounded more than their own number , made the rest of them , still double their own strength , lay down their arms , and recaptured nearly two thousand head of cattle they had driven off .::::besieged
The news came to me from the mayor of Maritzburg , who had <<target>> of it from a friend who had ridden in from Grey town .::::heard
He wrote to me expressing <<target>> admiration at the exploit .::::his
I sent privately to their captain and questioned him about it , intending to reprimand him severely for letting them go ; but he said that they had all resigned , as they had a <<target>> to do , for they are all sons of gentlemen , and draw no pay or provisions , and that he had therefore no control whatever over their actions after they left camp .::::right
I told him not to say anything about his having seen me , for that , as they had <<target>> , I should be obliged to take notice of the matter if it came to be talked about .::::returned
That young fellow who came here is the one who , with three <<target>> the others , tried to blow up the bridge at Komati-poort .::::of
He could not do that , but he played havoc with a <<target>> store of rifles , ammunition , and six or eight guns .::::large
After that I could not <<target>> well scold him . ''::::very
And he again turned his <<target>> on the opposite hill .::::glass
Here the fighting was almost over , and in <<target>> very short time all resistance had ceased .::::a
An aide-de-camp was sent off to order some of the guns to be taken , if possible , <<target>> to the top of Pieter 's Hill , and after immense exertions two batteries were placed there .::::up
As soon as this was accomplished , orders were <<target>> for the rest of the infantry to advance .::::sent
General Warren was in command , and the fourth brigade , under Colonel Norcott , and the eleventh , <<target>> Colonel Kitchener , now moved forward , taking advantage of what shelter could be obtained as they advanced .::::under
At the same time a strong force of colonial infantry moved to the right to attack <<target>> Boer trenches farther up the line of railway , and were soon hotly engaged .::::the
The defenders of Hart 's Hill , and the position between that and Pieter 's , opened a heavy fire as soon as the British infantry showed themselves ; but their morale was so shaken by <<target>> terrific bombardment to which they had been subjected , by the loss of Pieter 's Hill , and by the rifle fire now opened by its captors , that their fire was singularly ineffective .::::the
Many men dropped , but the loss was comparatively much smaller than that <<target>> by the Irish division when moving across the open on the 23rd .::::suffered
Taking advantage of every shelter , the troops moved steadily forward , maintaining <<target>> heavy fire whenever they did so , and winning their way steadily .::::a
Colonel Kitchener 's Brigade pressed on towards Hart 's Hill , which on the side by which <<target>> now attacked was far less formidable than that against which the Irish had dashed themselves .::::they
Arrived at its foot , the troops were in <<target>> shelter among the boulders that covered the slopes .::::comparative
Foot by foot they made their way upwards , until at last they gathered for a final assault , and <<target>> with a loud cheer scrambled up the last slope and with fixed bayonets drove the Boers in headlong flight .::::then
A similar success attended the eleventh brigade , who just at sunset carried the centre position , and a mighty cheer broke out <<target>> along the line at the capture of what all felt to be the last serious obstacle to their advance to Ladysmith .::::all
On the right , the Colonial troops had driven the Boers in front of them for <<target>> three miles , capturing entrenchment after entrenchment , until they arrived at Nelthorpe station .::::nearly
The three camps of the Boers contained an even larger amount of <<target>> than had been discovered in those of Monte Cristo and Hlangwane .::::spoil
It seemed that they had been perfectly confident that the positions were <<target>> , and had accumulated stores sufficient for a prolonged residence .::::impregnable
It was evident , too , that the wealthier men with them had preferred <<target>> situation to the more exposed camps on the summit of the hills .::::this
Clothes of a superior kind proved that their owners had been residents of Johannesburg or Pretoria , and <<target>> a different class altogether from the farm-labourers and herdsmen who formed the majority of the Boer army .::::of
The haste with which they had fled , when to their astonishment they discovered that the British attack could not be repulsed , was shown by the fact that a good <<target>> watches were found on bed-places and rough tables where they had been left when the Boers rushed to arms , and in the hurry of flight had been forgotten .::::many
The number of rifles that had <<target>> thrown away was very large .::::been
It was notorious that women had more than once been seen in the firing ranks of the Boers , and there were reports that Amazon corps were in course <<target>> formation in the Transvaal , the Boers , perhaps , remembering how sturdily the women of Haarlem had fought against the Spaniards in defence of their city .::::of
So complete had been the panic evinced by the headlong fight of the enemy that the general opinion was that it would be some time before they would again attempt a stand against our men , and that unless any entrenchments higher up the valley were held <<target>> men who had not witnessed what had taken place , and were commanded by leaders of the most determined character , Ladysmith would almost certainly be relieved within a couple of days , and the rescuing army would be thus rewarded for its toils and sacrifices .::::by
In a state of the wildest delight the lads returned to the spot where they had left <<target>> horses , where they found that Japhet and the two Swazis had arrived just before them .::::their
They and the Zulus were exhibiting their intense satisfaction at <<target>> defeat of the Boers by a wild war- dance .::::the
The party rode fast back to camp , for their spirits did not admit of <<target>> leisurely pace , and they left the natives to follow them more deliberately .::::a
The news had already been received in camp by the return of officers who witnessed the scene from a <<target>> near to that which the lads had attained , and its occupants were in a frenzy of delight .::::point
The Colonial corps <<target>> especially jubilant .::::were
This was the anniversary of Majuba Hill , the blackest in the history of the Colony , and one that the <<target>> in the Transvaal and Orange State always celebrated with great rejoicings , to the humiliation of the British Colonists .::::boers
Now that disgrace <<target>> wiped out .::::was
Late that evening an order was issued that Lord Dundonald with a squadron of Lancers and some Colonial <<target>> , in which the Maritzburg Scouts were included , were to reconnoitre along the line of railway .::::corps
All felt sure that no serious opposition was likely to be met with ; the defeat of the Boers had been so crushing and complete that <<target>> few of the fugitives would be found willing to again encounter the terrible artillery fire , followed by the irresistible onslaught of the infantry .::::assuredly
That evening , in spite of the scarcity of wood , <<target>> were lighted , and the Scouts gathered round them .::::bonfires
Every bottle of spirits and wine that remained in the camp <<target>> broached , and a most joyous evening was spent .::::was
I have made a point for years , whenever I wanted to do any business in Natal , <<target>> put it off till that date , so that I could get out of the Transvaal .::::to
When I could not manage it , I shut myself up and stopped in bed all day , though <<target>> there I used to grind my teeth when I heard the brutes shouting and singing in the streets .::::even
Still , to me it was not <<target>> such a humiliation as surrender day .::::half
And though I saw Majuba myself , it did not affect me half as much as did the abject <<target>> down of the British Government after they had collected an army at Newcastle in readiness to avenge Majuba .::::backing
We could not believe the <<target>> when it came .::::news
The fury of the troops was unbounded , and I would not have given a farthing for the lives of any <<target>> the men who were the authors of the surrender , had they been in the camp that day . ''::::of
`` What were you <<target>> there ? ''::::doing
`` I had a farm near Newcastle at that time , and two <<target>> my waggons had been taken up by the military for transport purposes .::::of
I went forward <<target>> Colley .::::with
It was just the same then as <<target>> was at the beginning here .::::it
There were plenty of colonists ready to take up arms , but the military authorities would <<target>> none of them ; they could manage the thing themselves without any aid from civilians .::::have
They knew that the natives had over and over again beaten the Boers , and <<target>> natives could do would be , merely child 's play to British soldiers .::::what
Sir George Colley was a brave officer , and I believe had proved himself a skilful one , but he knew nothing whatever <<target>> the Boer style of fighting , while we colonists understood it perfectly , and could match them at their own game .::::of
As it turned out , the British soldiers on that <<target>> did not , and it made all the difference .::::occasion
If Sir George Colley had accepted a few hundreds of us , who knew the Boers well , as scouts and skirmishers , the affair would have turned <<target>> very differently ; for , as you know , they did not succeed through the whole affair in taking one of the places held by our colonists .::::out
`` Well , we started from Newcastle , <<target>> the blundering began from the first .::::and
It was but twenty-five miles <<target>> Laing 's Nek .::::to
Instead of that , six days were wasted <<target>> going over that miserable bit of ground .::::in
The Boers , of course , took advantage of the time <<target>> had given them to prepare and entrench Laing 's Nek .::::we
I do n't think that troubled the military authorities at all ; an entrenchment thrown up by farmers and peasants <<target>> be but a worthless affair , and would not for a moment check the advance of British infantry .::::could
The consequence of all this was that <<target>> got the licking we deserved .::::we
Their entrenchment at the crest of the ridge <<target>> held by something like three thousand men .::::was
Colley had but three hundred and seventy infantry , a <<target>> in itself utterly inadequate for the work in hand .::::force
But , seeing some parties of Boer horsemen riding about , he thought it necessary to leave a strong body for <<target>> defence of his baggage , and accordingly sent only about two hundred and fifty men forward to attack the place .::::the
`` Well , we among the waggons had n't <<target>> doubt how it was going to turn out .::::a
The one battery with us opened fire upon the entrenchment , but you who know what their entrenchments are will guess that there was little damage done ; and when the soldiers went <<target>> the hill the Boers held their fire until they were close , and then literally swept them away , and , leaping over the entrenchments , took many of them prisoners .::::up
None would have got away at all if a few mounted infantry , who had managed to get <<target>> the Nek at another point , had n't charged down and so enabled the survivors to escape .::::up
One hundred and eighty out of the two <<target>> and fifty were killed or taken prisoners .::::hundred
Colley at once fell <<target>> four miles .::::back
The Boers on their part , making sure that they had got him safe , sent a strong force round , and <<target>> planted itself on the road between him and Newcastle , but before they did so some small reinforcements joined us .::::this
Three or four days passed , and then we Colonials quite made <<target>> our mind that there was nothing for it but surrender .::::up
Colley determined at last to try and open the road back , and with about two hundred <<target>> fifty men , with four cannon -- two of them mountain guns -- moved out .::::and
Some sixty soldiers were left on a commanding <<target>> to cover the passage of the Ingogo .::::spot
As soon as the force under Colley had got to the opposite crest of <<target>> ravine through which the river runs , they were attacked in great force .::::the
They took shelter among the boulders , and fought as <<target>> as it was possible for men to fight .::::bravely
The guns , however , were useless , for in half an <<target>> every officer , man and horse , was killed or wounded .::::hour
However , the Boers could not pluck up courage to make a rush , and the little force held <<target>> till it was dark , by which time more than two-thirds of them were killed or wounded .::::on
Colley , however , sent down and found that the water had not risen so high as to make it impossible to pass , and in the darkness , covered by the blinding <<target>> that was falling , he and the survivors moved quietly off , crossed the river , picked up the party left on the eminence commanding it , and returned to camp .::::rain
`` It was certain now that unless succoured our fate was sealed , but fortunately Evelyn <<target>> came up to Newcastle with a column that had been pressing forward from the sea .::::wood
Colley , of course , ought to have waited for him to arrive before he moved at <<target>> , and if he had done so , things might have turned out very differently .::::all
But he made the mistake of despising the Boers , <<target>> thinking that it was nothing but a walk over .::::and
When they heard that the column had reached Newcastle the Boers cleared off <<target>> line of communication , and Colley rode into Newcastle and saw Wood .::::the
We felt that we were well out of a bad business ; and were sure that the Boers , who are no good in attack , however well <<target>> fight behind shelter , would not venture to attack us , and that even if they did so we could keep them off till help came .::::they
But Colley could not <<target>> well alone .::::let
Instead of waiting till Wood came up and joined him , lie thought he might make a good stroke on his own account , <<target>> so retrieve the two defeats he had suffered ; so when the 92nd Regiment came up he determined to seize Majuba Hill .::::and
However , Colley decided not to wait , and with about <<target>> hundred and fifty men and officers he started at night .::::five
The hill was only four miles off as the crow flies , but the ground was frightfully cut <<target>> , and it was not until after six hours of tremendous work that they reached the summit .::::up
Two hundred men were left at the bottom of <<target>> hill to keep open communications with the camp .::::the
`` From a hill close to the camp <<target>> could make out what was going on .::::we
Soon after daybreak we saw a party of mounted men <<target>> towards the hill , where they usually stationed vedettes .::::ride
They were fired at as they approached , and directly <<target>> turmoil could be seen on Laing 's Nek .::::a
Waggons were inspanned , and we thought at first that they were <<target>> going to move off , but this was not so .::::all
They were only getting ready to go if they failed to recapture the hill , <<target>> in a short time we could see all their force moving towards it .::::and
Well , from where we were it seemed that the force on Majuba could have <<target>> a hundred thousand Boers at bay , and so they ought to have done .::::kept
`` For a time the Boers <<target>> not make much progress .::::did
With glasses , puffs of smoke could be made out <<target>> along the crest , and among the rocks below .::::all
The firing began in earnest at seven , and between twelve <<target>> one the Boer fire had ceased and ours died away .::::and
We thought it was all over , <<target>> went back to our waggons again .::::and
Soon after one o'clock there was a sudden outburst , and the men with the <<target>> observed that the Boers were close up to the top of the hill .::::glasses
A few minutes later it was on the <<target>> itself that the firing was going on .::::plateau
`` Colley had not <<target>> the Boers .::::known
No doubt his men were completely done up with their six hours ' toil among the hills and six hours ' fighting , and I do n't think a tenth of them were ever engaged , <<target>> Colley thought it was impossible that the position could be stormed ; so he only kept a handful of men at the edge of the plateau and allowed the rest to lie down and sleep .::::for
Certainly that was the case when the Boers , who had been <<target>> up among the rocks and bushes , made their rush .::::crawling
`` Well , you <<target>> know what happened .::::all
The few men on the edge <<target>> cut down at once .::::were
The Boers dashed forward , <<target>> up a heavy fire .::::keeping
Our fellows jumped up , but numbers were shot down as they did-so , <<target>> in spite of the efforts of their officers , a panic seized them .::::and
Eighty-six men were killed , one hundred and twenty-five <<target>> , fifty-one taken prisoners , and two missing .::::wounded
A few managed to make their way down the hill , and <<target>> the party that had been left there at the bottom .::::joined
`` These were also attacked , but beat off the Boers , <<target>> , maintaining perfect order , fought their way back to camp .::::and
You can imagine the consternation there was <<target>> the hideous business became known .::::when
We fell back at once to Newcastle , and <<target>> lucky we thought ourselves to get there safely .::::mightily
Fresh troops came up , and we were on the point of advancing again , confident <<target>> , after the lesson the Boers had given us , things could be managed better .::::that
Suddenly , like a thunderclap , the news came that the British Government had surrendered to the Boers , given up everything , abandoned the colonists , who had so bravely defended their towns , to their fate ; and , with the exception of making a proviso that the natives should be <<target>> treated -- but which , as nothing was ever done to enforce it , meant allowing the Boers to enslave and ill-treat them as they had done before -- and another proviso , maintaining the purely nominal supremacy of the Queen , the treaty was simply an entire and abject surrender .::::well
`` There is not a colonist who , since that time , has not known what must come of it , and that sooner <<target>> later the question whether the Dutch or the British were to be masters of the Cape would have to be fought out .::::or
But none of us dreamt that the British Government would allow the Boers to import hundreds of thousands of <<target>> , two or three hundred cannon , and enormous stores of ammunition in readiness for the encounter .::::rifles
Well , they have done it , <<target>> we have seen the consequences .::::and
Natal has been overrun , and <<target>> considerable portion of Cape Colony .::::a
We have lost here some ten thousand men , and half as many on the <<target>> side , and we may lose as many more before the business is finished .::::other
And all this because a handful of miserable curs at home twenty years ago were ready to betray <<target>> honour of England , in order that they might make matters smooth for themselves at home . ''::::the
Just as the story came to an end the assembly blew in the camp of the Scouts , and on running in the men found that Captain Brookfield had received <<target>> order to mount at once and ride to join the cavalry under Lord Dundonald at the front , as a reconnaissance was to be made in the morning .::::an
Five minutes later all were in the saddle and trotting across the plain <<target>> Colenso , as they were to follow the line of railway up .::::towards
It was exciting work as the mounted <<target>> under Lord Dundonald rode along .::::horse
As far as could be seen from the various points in our possession the passage was clear , but experience had <<target>> how the Boers would lie quiet , even when in large numbers , while scouts were passing close to them .::::taught
At Colenso Colonel Long had sent two <<target>> men on ahead of his battery .::::mounted
And it was on their report that there were apparently no Boers in the <<target>> that the batteries were pushed forward into the fatal trap prepared for them .::::neighbourhood
So Chris and his companions , at the rear of the colonial cavalry , trotted <<target>> ready at a moment 's notice to swing round their rifles for instant action .::::along
They watched every stone and clump of bushes on the slopes of the valley for any foe that might <<target>> lurking there , and who at any moment might pour out a rain of bullets into the column .::::be
Very few words were spoken on the <<target>> , the tension was too great .::::way
They knew that Ladysmith had telegraphed that the <<target>> appeared to be everywhere falling back .::::boers
But a few thousands of their best fighting men might have remained to strike one terrible blow at the troops who <<target>> open fight had shown themselves their superiors , and had driven them from position after position that they believed impregnable .::::in
However , as one after another of the spots where an ambuscade would be likely to be laid passed , and there were still <<target>> signs of the enemy , the keenness of the watch began to abate , and the set expression of the faces to relax .::::no
Then as the hills receded and the valley opened before <<target>> a pleasurable excitement succeeded the grim expectation of battle .::::them
The task that had proved so hard was indeed fulfilled ; the Boers <<target>> gone , and the siege of Ladysmith was at an end .::::were
As they emerged from the valley into the plain in which Ladysmith is situated , there was an insensible increase of speed ; men talked joyously together , scarcely <<target>> for replies ; the horses seemed to catch the infection of their riders ' spirits , and the pennons of the Lancers in front to flutter more gaily .::::waiting
Onward they swept , cantering now <<target>> they approached the town .::::until
Then men could be seen running towards the road ; from every house they poured out , men and <<target>> , some waving hats and handkerchiefs , some too much overpowered by their feelings for outward demonstrations .::::women
As the columns reached this point they broke into a walk , and answered with ringing cheers the fainter but no less hearty hurrahs of those <<target>> came to rescue ; and yet the troopers themselves were scarcely less affected than the crowd that pressed round to shake them by the hand .::::they
They had known that provisions were nearly exhausted in the city , and that for some time <<target>> all had been on short rations ; but they had not dreamt of anything like this .::::past
It seemed to them that they were surrounded by a population of skeletons , haggard and worn , almost too weak to drag themselves along , <<target>> too feeble to shout , their clothes in rags , their eyes unnaturally large , their hands nerveless , their utterances broken by sobs .::::almost
For the soldiers were there <<target>> well as the civilians .::::as
There was little military in their appearance ; there was no uniformity in their <<target>> , save that all were alike ragged , stained and destitute of colour .::::dress
Could their rescuers have seen them , themselves unseen , a <<target>> days earlier , they would have been even more shocked .::::few
Then the listlessness brought about by hope deferred , and of late almost the extinction of hope , weakness caused by disease and famine , had been supreme ; and had <<target>> Boers had any idea of the state to which they were reduced , a renewal of the attack of the eth of January could hardly have failed of success .::::the
They had learned by the ever-nearing roar of the cannon that progress was being made , and for the past four days had <<target>> elevated points near the town been able to make out the movements of our troops on the positions they had captured .::::from
They had seen the Boers breaking up their camps , carrying off their stores <<target>> by waggon across the western passes or by the trains from Modder Spruit .::::either
They had seen the cannon being withdrawn from their positions on <<target>> hills , and felt that their deliverance was at hand .::::the
Through an ever-increasing crowd <<target>> column moved on .::::the
Sir George White and his staff , the mayor , and the <<target>> guards , every officer and soldier , joined in the greeting .::::town
But no stay <<target>> made .::::was
After a few minutes ' talk with Sir George White , Lord Dundonald gave the order , and the cavalry moved forward , and as soon as they were free from the crowd <<target>> on at a rapid pace in hopes of overtaking the retiring Boers , and glad that the scene to which they had looked forward with such pleasant expectations was at an end .::::trotted
There had not been a <<target>> eye among them .::::dry
None could have witnessed the sobbing women , the men down whose <<target>> the tears streamed uncontrolledly , and have remained himself unmoved .::::cheeks
`` It is terrible , '' Chris said to <<target>> , who was riding next to him .::::sankey
`` I could not have imagined <<target>> so dreadful as their appearance .::::anything
I did not realize what it was like when , two or three months before I left Johannesburg , I read in Motley 's book about the war in the Netherlands of the state of things <<target>> Leyden when the Prince of Orange burst his way through to their rescue , and of the terrible appearance of the starved inhabitants , but now I can quite understand how awfully bad it was .::::in
It must have been <<target>> worse then .::::even
There the people had nothing but the weeds they gathered , <<target>> boiled down with the scraps they could pick up .::::and
There they died in hundreds of actual starvation ; <<target>> can not have been quite so bad here .::::it
But as we see , though there has been just enough food to keep life together , that has been all , <<target>> it has been from disease brought on by famine , and not by famine itself , that they have died .::::and
I expect that anxiety and fever have had as <<target>> to do with it as hunger . ''::::much
You know , when we were grumbling sometimes at not being employed in the fighting , we have wished we had stopped <<target>> Ladysmith , and gone through the siege there ; now , one can thank God that one did not do so .::::in
We have pictured to ourselves everyone actively employed , the vigilance at all the outposts , the skirmishing with the <<target>> who crept up too closely , the excitement of repelling their attack , and all that sort of thing .::::boers
It is all very good to read about , but now we know what it really meant <<target>> sees that we were a pack of fools to have wished to be there . ''::::one
`` Yes ; I suppose one never knows <<target>> is g'ood for one , Sankey .::::what
Now as I look back I think <<target>> we have been extraordinarily fortunate .::::that
We have lived well ; I do n't say we have not had <<target>> certain amount of discomfort , but of course we expected that .::::a
What I am most pleased at is that not one of us has been killed , and only a few <<target>> us wounded , the only serious one being Willesden , and he is fairly on the way to recovery .::::of
For boys we have done a very good share , and I expect that now we have driven the Boers back here , <<target>> Kimberley has been relieved , and there is a tremendous force gathering on that side , it will soon be over . ''::::and
`` Yes , I think <<target>> you , Chris .::::with
And I fancy that the others are all <<target>> to long for the end of it .::::beginning
I should say that those whose people have gone to England may stop on for a bit , but the rest of us will <<target>> to our friends at Durban or the Cape , at any rate for a time , till we see how things go .::::go
We know that Lord Roberts has <<target>> Cronje surrounded and shut up .::::got
I expect that is one of the reasons <<target>> the Boers have been moving from here .::::that
The Free Staters will certainly wish to get back to defend Bloemfontein , and the Transvaal people must <<target>> that it is no use stopping here when their own country will be shortly invaded . ''::::feel
`` Yes ; I expect that is the reason for their shutting up as suddenly as they <<target>> done after fighting so hard for the first five or six days of our advance . ''::::have
On arriving at Modder Spruit it was found that the last train had left an hour before ; they pushed on , however , until a smart fire <<target>> a hill in front of them , which was evidently held in force , broke out suddenly , and two cannon from another eminence joined in .::::from
Having thus discovered that the Boers were not entirely evacuating the country , but intending to defend the <<target>> , at any rate until a strong force came up , Lord Dundonald returned to Ladysmith .::::biggarsberg
In the afternoon General Buller rode over attended <<target>> only one or two of the staff .::::by
He stayed but a very short time , to learn from <<target>> White the state of affairs , and then returned .::::general
`` Do you think that we shall <<target>> at once , sir ? ''::::pursue
`` Not at <<target>> , Chris .::::once
As to his own army , I expect <<target>> will keep the main portion round Chieveley .::::he
No doubt he will bring the greater part if not all the garrison of Ladysmith back to Frere and <<target>> , both to get them out of the pestilential air here and for convenience of feeding them .::::estcourt
I should think that Buller will leave in garrison here an infantry brigade , part of the cavalry , and two or three batteries , and this with the sick who <<target>> not be moved , will be about as much as our transport will be able to manage until the railway bridge is repaired and the line put in running order .::::can
Till that is done there is no possibility of a general advance ; and indeed there will have to <<target>> a great accumulation of stores here , as this will then become our base instead of Chieveley .::::be
`` No doubt a great deal will depend on <<target>> things are going on the other side .::::how
Now that Roberts has as good as captured Cronje and his <<target>> he will of course advance to Bloemfontein and occupy it .::::force
He will then be no more able to advance farther <<target>> Buller can -- in fact , less able .::::than
Our line of railway is secured , and we can be fed by it ; but at present we have not crossed the Orange River from the south , <<target>> the railway between that and Bloemfontein is in the hands of the Boers , and we know that they have blown up the bridges across the river .::::and
Until these are restored , and the line secure in our hands , Roberts 's <<target>> will have to live on the stores that they have brought with them .::::army
Then the work of forming a base depot from the coast will begin , and it needs something enormous in the way of provisions <<target>> carriage to supply an army of sixty or seventy thousand men , all of whom must as they advance be fed from Bloemfontein .::::and
`` As long as he is stationary there it is likely enough that the bulk of Joubert 's army will cling to Natal , knowing well enough that before we shall be <<target>> a condition to move forward they can entrench their positions on the Biggarsberg and the Drakenberg until they are quite as formidable as those we have been knocking our heads against .::::in
I should not be at all surprised if it is a <<target>> of months before Roberts is in a position to advance .::::couple
Of course at present we have no idea what the plans are , but likely enough at least half the force here <<target>> be sent down to Durban , and then by water to East London , and from there to Bloemfontein by rail .::::may
It would be ridiculous for us to renew the sort of fighting we have been doing when the enemy are sure <<target>> clear out when Roberts crosses the Vaal , and Natal be thus freed without any further loss of life .::::to
Possibly the troops may not be sent round by sea , <<target>> will remain here until Roberts gets as far as Kroonstadt .::::but
Then , no doubt , a division will be sent down through Bethlehem to Harrismith , and so open <<target>> Reenen 's Pass , in which case the troops from here can go up by train to Bethlehem .::::van
At any rate , I am afraid that most of <<target>> will remain here for at least two months .::::us
`` You see , most of the colonial irregulars were enlisted for only three months , and that is up already , and no doubt <<target>> great many of them will not extend their time , and I do n't suppose the military authorities will want them to do so .::::a
There is no doubt that while mounted men were invaluable in the fighting in Cape Colony , and will be so in the Orange Free State , they are of very <<target>> use in this mountainous country in the north of Natal -- they are so many more mouths to be fed , man and beast , without any corresponding advantage .::::little
They have done splendidly where they have had a chance , and the Imperial Light Horse have suffered heavily , <<target>> as a whole I think that we should have been more useful as infantry than as mounted men .::::but
Infinitely more useful if , instead of being kept at the head-quarters of the army as we have been , for no possible reason that anyone can see , we had all been scattered over the country to the east , in which case we should <<target>> kept the marauding Boers from wandering about , should have saved hundreds and hundreds of loyal farmers from being ruined , and the loss of many thousands of cattle and horses , which will have to be paid for after the war is over .::::have
I do not think that there is a single colonist who is not of opinion that the way in which we have been kept inactive from the beginning of the war , instead of being employed as irregular <<target>> should have been , in protecting the country , preventing the Boers from drawing supplies , and forcing them to keep in a body as our own troops have done , has been a stupendous mistake . ''::::cavalry
Chris repeated this conversation <<target>> his comrades .::::to
`` I think , '' he said , `` that if there is no chance of <<target>> anything for another two or three months , we might as well break up .::::doing
I have no doubt a good <<target>> of the Colonials will re-enlist .::::many
Numbers of them are working men , either from Johannesburg or belonging to Natal ; they would find it very difficult <<target>> get work here , and the five shillings a day pay is therefore of the greatest importance to them .::::to
But it is <<target>> with us .::::different
We do n't draw pay , we simply agreed to band ourselves together to <<target>> an opportunity of paying out the Boers for their treatment of us .::::have
At the time we agreed to that , we <<target>> no idea that they would invade Natal .::::had
Of course that was an additional <<target>> to us to fight .::::inducement
As loyalists , and capable of bearing arms , it would have been our duty , even if we had no <<target>> feeling in the matter , to enlist to help to clear the country of the enemy who invaded it .::::personal
Now that Ladysmith is rescued and there are certainly enough troops in South Africa to finish the <<target>> up , I do not see that it is our duty to continue our service .::::business
Anyhow , I have pretty well made up my <<target>> to resign and go round to Cape Town .::::mind
There I am almost sure to find my mother , and perhaps my father , for we know that they <<target>> expelled almost all the English remaining about the mines , and he may have been among them . ''::::have
`` I agree with you <<target>> , '' Sankey said .::::heartily
`` At any rate , I should vote <<target>> our breaking up for the present .::::for
Twelve of the others <<target>> similar opinions .::::expressed
The friends of the eight who did <<target>> do so had returned to England .::::not
Carmichael was one <<target>> these .::::of
`` Well , '' he said after a pause , `` I do not say that <<target>> are not quite right , but I have no one to go to here .::::you
My people went home as <<target>> as they reached Durban .::::soon
If I were to join them I might hear when I landed that the war was just over , <<target>> that they had either started to come back again , or were on the point of doing so .::::and
I was born out here , and have <<target>> seen any of my relations in Scotland .::::never
Though I should like very much to spend a few months in the old country , it would not be worth while going home for so short <<target>> time ; for I am sure my father will hurry back to his work at the mines as soon as Johannesburg is taken by us .::::a
I fancy all those who have not spoken are <<target>> about the same situation that I am . ''::::in
There was a <<target>> of assent .::::murmur
The smell of dead horses and things <<target>> enough to make one ill .::::is
The water of the river is poisonous , for we know the <<target>> used to throw their dead animals in it on purpose .::::boers
So I shall go down to Maritzburg and wire to <<target>> people where I am , and ask for orders .::::my
I shall tell them to telegraph , so in a week <<target>> sending off my wire I shall get an answer . ''::::after
The others who had no friends in South <<target>> expressed their intention of doing the same .::::africa
`` I do n't think we need bother about the horses , '' Chris said ; `` being such good animals , I have no doubt that <<target>> are plenty of officers in the cavalry regiments here who will be glad to buy them as remounts for the money we gave for them .::::there
That would save us all the trouble of getting them <<target>> by train to Maritzburg and selling them there .::::down
Well , then , as there are no dissentients , <<target>> will tell Captain Brookfield what we have settled . ''::::i
`` I quite agree with you , '' the officer <<target>> when Chris had told him of their intentions .::::said
`` In the first place , it would be a <<target>> waste of time for you to remain here .::::serious
Still , that is of comparatively little consequence , but I do think that <<target>> would be a grievous pity for you to risk your lives further .::::it
You have done <<target>> good service .::::wonderfully
You have had an experience that you will <<target>> back upon with satisfaction all your lives .::::look
You have done your duty , <<target>> more than your duty .::::and
You have before you useful lives , and have amply shown that in whatever position <<target>> may be placed you will be a credit to yourselves and your friends .::::you
Therefore , Chris , I think in <<target>> respect your decision is right .::::every
It will be some relief to me , for to tell you frankly , when you started on that expedition to Komati , and the other day , when you <<target>> rode off to the farm , I felt that it would probably be my duty to write to some of your parents to tell them of your deaths .::::all
Therefore , by all means <<target>> me your resignations .::::give
It was agreed among the party that as they had <<target>> to go they might as well go at once .::::decided
`` I hear , '' Chris said , `` that General Buller is going to make <<target>> formal entry here on Saturday , and that the garrison will line the road .::::a
On the day appointed the garrison turned out to receive the general and the troops who had struggled so long and gallantly to effect their rescue , and the Devons , Gloucesters , Rifles , Leicesters , <<target>> , Liverpools , sappers , artillerymen , and the Naval Brigade marched out from their camps and lined the road as far as the railway-station , where the remnant of the cavalry brigade were drawn up .::::manchesters
At eleven o'clock Sir George White , Sir Archibald Hunter , and Colonel Duff and his staff <<target>> up and took their place in the front of the shattered tower of the town- hall .::::rode
Here , too , Captain Lambton and <<target>> other officers took their place .::::many
Not far from these were a score of civilians who had not shared in the general exodus that had been going on <<target>> the day on which the town was relieved , but had delayed their departure in order to witness the historical scene .::::from
At last the head of <<target>> column was seen approaching .::::the
Lord Dundonald 's men had ridden down on the previous day , and the <<target>> Colonial Volunteers had now the honour of forming the general 's escort .::::mounted
They led the way , and after <<target>> came General Buller with his escort .::::them
The Dublin Fusiliers were placed at the head of the column in acknowledgment of the gallantry displayed by them in every <<target>> ; then came the men of Warren 's , Lyttleton 's , and Barton 's brigades , with their artillery .::::fight
Great indeed was the contrast between the sturdy , bronzed , and well-fed soldiers who cheered as they marched , <<target>> of them carrying their helmets on their bayonets , and the lines of emaciated men through whom they passed .::::many
These cheered too , but their voices sounded strange and thin , and many , indeed , were <<target>> much overcome by weakness and emotion to be able to add their voices to the shouts .::::too
The enthusiasm of the troops rose to the highest when they passed a group of <<target>> and children , who , with streaming eyes , greeted them as they passed .::::women
The pipes of the Highlanders and the beating <<target>> drums added to the roar of sound .::::of
The contrast between the dress of rescuers and <<target>> was as great as their personal appearance .::::rescued
Sir George White 's men had of late had but little work , and had prepared for <<target>> occasion to the best of their power , as if for a review at Aldershot .::::the
They had done <<target>> they could .::::what
The belts , accoutrements , and rifles <<target>> all been rubbed up and scoured .::::had
On the other hand , the uniforms of regiments that marched in were travel-stained , begrimed with <<target>> dust of battle and the mud of bivouac , until their original hue had entirely disappeared .::::the
They looked as if they had at first been dragged <<target>> thorn bushes and then been given a mud-bath .::::through
Captain Lambton rode forward to meet the sailors of the Terrible with the guns that had done such <<target>> , followed by the howitzers which had almost equally contributed to the final success of the operations .::::service
He was loudly cheered by the sailors , and the <<target>> greetings were exchanged between him and their officers .::::heartiest
Both in attack and defence the <<target>> Brigade had performed inestimable services .::::naval
Behind the column came a large <<target>> of men in civilian dress .::::body
Their appearance was as unkempt as that of the troops , but among these there was no approach to <<target>> order , and yet their heroism had been in no way inferior to that of the troops .::::military
These were the stretcher-bearers , who had in every fight carried on their work of mercy <<target>> the heaviest fire , and that without the excitement that nerves soldiers to face danger .::::under
Many of them had fallen while so engaged , but this had in no way unnerved their companions , who had not only carried on <<target>> work during daylight , but had often laboured all night until the last wounded man had been found and carried down to the hospital .::::the
When the names of the heroes of the force that relieved Ladysmith are <<target>> those of the stretcher-bearers are worthy of a place among them .::::recounted
After the troops had been dismissed and matters had settled down a little , Chris went over <<target>> the camp of the cavalry brigade , and spoke to the first officer he met .::::to
The party to which I belong have twenty-five horses ; they are <<target>> good animals , and cost us sixty pounds apiece last October .::::exceptionally
We furnished our <<target>> equipment .::::own
Anyhow , we are ready to sell them <<target>> the price we gave for them . ''::::at
`` We all want remounts badly <<target>> , '' the officer said .::::enough
`` Will you come in with <<target>> to the colonel ? ''::::me
Entering the mess tent , where the colonel and several officers were standing talking , <<target>> 's guide introduced him to them , and repeated the offer he had made .::::chris
`` Well , at any rate , Leslie , '' the colonel said , `` you and Mainwaring may as well go down and look at the <<target>> ; it would certainly be a comfort to get remounts , for more than half of our chargers are gone , and the rest are skeletons .::::horses
I ca n't ask you , Mr. King , <<target>> you would like to take anything to drink .::::if
I suppose it will be another ten days before we are in a <<target>> to be able to offer even the smallest approach to hospitality . ''::::position
`` I quite understand that , <<target>> , '' Chris said .::::sir
`` In that respect we have been <<target>> as badly off at Chieveley .::::nearly
We have had plenty to eat and drink , but a cup of tea or chocolate has been the only refreshment we have been in a position to offer <<target>> a visitor , for the line has been so fully occupied with government transport that it has been next to impossible to get up any private stores .::::to
I am afraid that very little in that way can be brought up here until the bridge is repaired and the line in working order , <<target>> it is as much as the transport will be able to do to bring food enough from Chieveley for the troops and people here . ''::::for
The two officers were more than satisfied <<target>> the appearance of the horses .::::with
None of the officers was able to pay in gold , as the paymaster 's department had not a <<target>> left , though small payments were made to the men until nearly the end of the siege .::::coin
Chris , however , readily accepted their drafts and cheques , <<target>> these could be paid into the bank at Maritzburg .::::as
`` Now we will get rid of our <<target>> stores which the men brought up yesterday .::::remaining
I propose that instead of selling them we divide them into <<target>> and send them down to the three cavalry messes .::::three
I am sorry we have not a few bottles of spirits left , but the tea , <<target>> chocolate , and sugar , and so on , will be very welcome to them . ''::::and
The six natives carried the things down , and brought <<target>> with them notes of warm thankfulness from the colonels .::::back
`` How about our <<target>> , Chris ? ''::::saddles
`` We can take them <<target>> us to Maritzburg .::::with
We can hand over the kettles and so on , and the waterproof sheets , to Brookfield 's men <<target>> remain here , and the blankets can be given to the natives when we get there . ''::::who
The next day , after a hearty farewell from Captain Brookfield and their comrades , who sent them off with a ringing cheer , the party <<target>> , marching by the side of one of the waggons that had brought up stores ; in this they placed their saddles and blankets .::::started
When they arrived at Chieveley they had no difficulty <<target>> getting a place in a covered truck .::::in
In this they <<target>> to Maritzburg .::::travelled
Here they stayed for three or four days ; then , after making a handsome present in addition to what they had promised to the natives , and further gladdening their hearts by <<target>> them their blankets , Chris and those who were going down said good-bye to Carmichael and his party , with hopes that they would all meet again at Johannesburg before long .::::giving
Three or four whose friends had remained at Durban stayed <<target>> , the rest took passage together for Cape Town .::::there
At Maritzburg Chris had found a letter awaiting him from his mother , saying that his father had a fortnight before joined her there , as the Boers had commandeered <<target>> mines and had ordered him to leave , as he would not work them for their benefit and so provide funds for the support of the Boer army .::::the
She said that they intended to leave at once for England , and that <<target>> was to follow them when he gave up his work with the army .::::he
